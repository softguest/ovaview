OBJECTIVE: The aim of this subject is to introduce students to the basics of pest management beginning with the understanding of some terminologies. Student will be able to appreciate the definition of pest as human construct. In addition, they will familiarize themselves with some common pests and how they cause damage.
1. Introduction 
For many years now, scientists have been battling with proper definition of the word ‘pest’. It seem that in the variations of their definition, they all agree on one thing: that the definition is a human construct;
What is a pest?
A pest is any organism that interferes with man’s interest
A pest is any organism that causes economic damage to man’s property
Pests are organisms that are considered harmful or detrimental to humans, their possessions and other human interest. In other words, they injure humans, animals, desirable plants, structures or possessions and spread diseases.
For example, a grasshopper eating the leaves of your vegetable, termite destroying a wood roof of your house, the noises from mosquito and crickets, siam weed growing in your farm constitute a pest problem.


2. Pest Concept
From the definitions above, it is clear that a pest is human invention. Ordinarily, these organisms feeding on a plant is just performing its normal function in the ecosystem. A pest is defined from a biased human perspective/interest. It can be concluded that the definition of pest is very subjective – it lacks any ecological justification.
For example, Bermuda grass is grown on lawn for decoration. In this case, it is not considered a pest. However, if it grows in a cabbage garden, it will be considered a pest. You see that the same organism has different status (pest and not a pest status) based on the situation/interest.
The noise from crickets is considered a nuisance (pest status) but the same cricket is eaten (not a pest status).
Siam weed (Chromolaena odorata): weed in the field but also medicinal
Elephant gras (Penisetum purpureum): weed in the field but also a fodder. 
It is important to note that the definition of a pest is also principally economic. The organism should be able to cause an economic damage. That means that the severity of the damage should be assess or predicted before any control measure. Consequently, the number (population density) of the pest is important.
3. Types of Pests
3.1 Insects
An insect is an arthropod (jointed body parts) with six legs or 3 three pairs of legs (hexapod). Eg. Grasshoppers, locust. Chemicals used to control (kill/suppress) insect population is called insecticides.
3.2 Weeds
Weeds are plants that interfere with human activities or in some way intrude upon human comfort and welfare. They can compete with a crop of interest for nutrients, space, water, sunlight etc. e.g Siam weed, elephant grass. The chemical used to kill or suppress weed is called weedicide/herbicide
3.3 Mollusks
Theres are large group of animals characterized by soft and non-segmented bodies. They may be aquatic or terrestrial and may or may not possess shell. E.g snails, slugs, octopus, squids, scallops. The chemical used to control these organisms is molluscicide (e.g snail bait/slug pellet)
3.4 Vertebrate
A vertebrate is an animal with a spinal cord surrounded by cartilage or bone. In other words, they have backbones from which they derived their names. E.g fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals
How can humans be pest?
Rodenticide – for rodents
Avicide – for birds
3.5 Mites
Mites are insect-like organisms with eight legs. These arthropods belong to the order Acarina of the class Arachnida. E.g red spider mite: Tetranychus urticae. The chemicals used to control them is called acaricide or miticide.

2.1. CATEGORIES OF PEST
Based on occurrence following are pest categories 
Regular pest: Frequently occurs on crop - Close association e.g. Rice stem borer, tomato fruit borer. stemborers and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) in maize.
Occasional pest: Infrequently occurs, no close association e.g. Caseworm on rice, Mango stem borer 
Seasonal pest: Occurs during a particular season every year e.g. Red hairy caterpillar on groundnut, Mango hoppers 
Persistent pests: Occurs on the crop throughout the year and is difficult to control e.g. Chilli thrips, mealy bug on banana,  
Sporadic pests: Pest occurs in isolated localities during some period. e.g. Coconut slug caterpillar
Migratory or cyclical pest. They appear cyclically and often migratory in nature and they require control occasionally or intermittently. E.g locust

2.2. PEST IDENTIFICATION
Accurate identification of a pest is the first step in any effective pest management program.
Never attempt a pest control program until you are sure of what the pest is.
Correct identification of a pest allows you to determine basic information about it including its life cycle and the time that it is most susceptible to controlled. The more you about the pest and the factors that influence its development and spread, the easier it is to develop cost-effective and sustainable control programs.
To identify and control a pest, you need to know the following (NOTE THESE FOUR POINTS)
The physical features of the pest you are likely to encounter, e.g long, round, elongated, winged, wingless etc
Characteristics of the damage they cause: folded leaves, eating leaves and fruits, eggs laid inside fruits, cutting of shoots, wildering of plants, necrosis etc
Their development and biology
Whether they are continuous, sporadic or potential pest.

LECTURE 3: GOALS/PRINCIPLES OF PEST MANAGEMENT
OUTLINE:
Introduction 
Principles of pest management
Threshold level concept
Drill 

OBJECTIVE: students will familiarize themselves with the goals and objectives of pest management. Also, they will be drilled on the threshold level concept as a relevant tool for decision making in pest management
1. Introduction 
Based on your objectives, you could be talking about pest control or pest management.
Pest control involves the treatment that will eliminate infestation after the it has already occurred while pest management seeks to limit the survival and reproduction of pest by removing resources (make the environment unfavourable) such as water, food, shelter etc.
The primary objective of pest control is to eliminate whereas that of pest management is to prevent future infestation or maintain the pest population below a level that can cause economic harm to the crops (below ETL).
 

2 Goals/objectives of pest control/Principles of pest management
Whenever you try to control or manage a pest, you will want to achieve one of these three goals, or some combination of them.
⦁	Prevention: the objective is to keep a pest from becoming a problem. Prevention can be achieved when the pest’s presence or abundance can be predicted in advance as in the case of continuous pests. For example, some plant diseases occur only under certain environmental conditions. If such conditions are present, you can take steps to prevent the plant disease organisms from harming the desirable plants.
⦁	Suppression is a common goal in many pest situations. The intent is to reduce the number of pests to a level where the harm they are causing is acceptable. Once a pest's presence is detected and the decision is made that control is necessary, suppression and prevention often are joint goals. The right combination of control measures can often suppress the pests already present and prevent them from building up again to a level where they are causing unacceptable harm.

⦁	Eradication is a rare goal in outdoor pest situations, because it is difficult to achieve. Usually the goal is prevention and/or suppression. Eradication is occasionally attempted when a foreign pest has been accidentally introduced but is not yet established in an area. Such eradication strategies often are supported by the Government. Mediterranean fruit fly. gypsy moth, and fire ant control programs are examples.
In indoor areas, eradication is a more common goal. Enclosed environments usually are smaller, less complex, and more easily controlled than outdoor areas. In many enclosed areas, such as dwellings; schools; office buildings; and health care, food processing, and food preparation facilities, certain pests cannot or will not be tolerated.

3 Pest control 
Event though is pest is present, it may not do much harm. It could cost more to control the pest than would be lost because of pest damage. Thus, the following necessary pest control guidelines must be considered.
⦁	Control a pest only when it is causing or is expected to cause more harm than is reasonable to accept.
⦁	Use a control strategy that will reduce the pest numbers to an acceptable level.
⦁	Cause as little harm as possible to everything except the pest.
⦁	Even though a pest is present, it may not do very much harm. It could cost more to control the pest than would be lost because of the pest's damage.


4 Threshold level concept
In many instances, the damage to a plant is directly proportional to the number of pest (population density). For example, one locust compared to 100 locust: the damage won’t be the same. Consequently, the population of the pest needs to reach a certain level (threshold level) in order to warrant action. The population parameters include:
4.1 General Equilibrium Position (GEP)
The average density of a population over a long period of time around which the pest population tends to fluctuate due to biotic and abiotic factors, and in the absence of permanent environmental changes
4.2 Economic threshold level (ETL)
It is the population density at which control measures should be taken to prevent the population from reaching an economic injury level (EIL)
4.3 Economic Injury Level (EIL)
This is the lowest population density that will cause economic damage (the amount of injury which will justify the cost of artificial control measures). ETL is always less than EIL.
The EIL is the most basic of the decision rules; it is a theoretical value that, if actually attained by a pest population, will result in economic damage. Therefore, the EIL is a measure against which we evaluate the destructive status and potential of a pest population.
 
GEP, ETL and EIL concept
 
Note the following:
⦁	Below the EIL cost of control > benefit
⦁	Above the EIL benefit > cost of control
⦁	ETL have been established for many pests.
⦁	It is important to constantly monitor pest population in order to decide when to take action.
⦁	ETL and EIL are very important decision-making parameters in integrated pest management programs.

Some examples of threshold
 

Calculating EIL
The EIL is governed by five primary variables: 
⦁	cost of the management tactic per production unit, (C). i.e per plant, per acre etc 
⦁	market value per production unit (V), 
⦁	injury units per pest(I), i.e percent yield loss per pest
⦁	damage per injury unit (D), 
⦁	and the proportional reduction in pest attack or in injury from treatment (K). 
If the relationship of these variables is linear or roughly so, the EIL can be given as:
EIL = C/VIDK

Example
There is a beetle that attacks apple and 1 beetle can attack 5 apples per tree to have feeding injuries. Each injured fruit means a lost of 50frs. A normal apple (not attacked) can sell for 150frs at the local market. An insecticide and labour cost per tree of 500frs will reduce the damage by 90%. Calculate the EIL
EIL = C/VIDK
C = 500frs,
V = 150fr
I = 5
D = 50 frs
K = 0.9
Therefore EIL = 500/150 x 5 x 50 x 0.9 = 14.8 approx. 15 beetles
The economic injury level increases or decreases as these values change depending on their position within the formula. As the cost of control (C) increases, it takes more insect damage to justify an application, and the economic injury level increases. In contrast, if the value of the commodity (V) increases, it takes fewer lost bushels to justify the cost of control and the economic injury level decreases. 
Note that in many cases, I and D are combined into a single measure that relates the amount of yield lost directly to the insect population density.

PEST CATEGORIES ACCORDING TO EIL, GEP AND DB

⦁	Key pest - Most severe and damaging pests - GEP lies above EIL always - Spray temporarily bring population below EIL - These are persistent pests - The environment must be changed to bring GEP below EIL e.g. Cotton bollworm, Diamond backmoth
 
⦁	Major pest - GEP lies very close to EIL or coincides with EIL - Economic damage can be prevented by timely and repeated sprays e.g. Cotton jassid, Rice stem borer
 
⦁	Minor pest/Occasional pest - GEP is below the EIL usually - Rarely they cross EIL - Can be controlled by spraying e.g. Cotton stainers, Rice hispa, Ash weevils
 
⦁	Sporadic pests - GEP generally below EIL - Sometimes it crosses EIL and cause severe loss in some places/periods e.g. Sugarcane pyrilla, White grub, Hairy caterpillar

 
⦁	Potential pests - They are not pests at present - GEP always less than EIL - If environment changed may cause economic loss e.g. S. litura is potentia pest on tomato

 
DRILL
⦁	What is the difference between pest control and pest management

Requirements of successful pest control
Drill 

OBJECTIVE: students will familiarize themselves with the components of pest management
1. Introduction
Pest management is defined as ‘the application of technology to achieve a satisfactory reduction of pest numbers or effects (pest control)’. Pest control measured can be classified based on the source of the control measure and on the purpose of the control measure.

Pest control can be broadly classified as Natural control or Applied (Artificial control) based on the source of the control measures.
Natural control: In nature, pest population is kept in check by many factors such as abiotic and biotic environmental factors. The operation of the natural factors is not dependent upon man and not influenced by him. This is called 'natural control'.

Applied or artificial control: It is planned and organized by man to eliminate or reduce the number of insects and the damage. 

The control measures are generally termed as (1) prophylactic or preventive and (2) curative or direct methods based on the purpose of the control measures.
2. Pest control measures based on purpose
2.1 Prophylactic or preventive methods: These are ‘measures taken as a preventive step before the actual occurrence of the pest’. Effective against seasonal or persistent pests. Field sanitation, ploughing, crop rotation, resistant varieties, trap cropping, mixed cropping, crop residue destruction, pest free healthy seeds, seed treatment, swabbing tree trunks with insecticides or tar, drying of grains, adjusting of sowing time, allelopathy, etc. are some of the preventive methods.

2.2 Curative or direct methods: These are ‘measures taken as a curative step to eliminate the insects after they have gained a foothold in the crops. The following are some of the curative methods.
Cultural methods: good tillage, racking and hoeing, pruning, fertilization, water management, mulching, de-trashing, timely harvest etc.
Resistant varieties: Some varieties are inherently less damaged than the other by insects
Mechanical methods: Hand destruction, exclusion and trapping.
Physical methods: Heat, cold, humidity, light and sound energy.
Chemical method: Attractants, repellents, insecticides, growth inhibitors, sterilant etc.,
Biological methods: Parasites, pathogens and predators.
Genetic method: Male sterile techniques.
Regulatory methods: Quarantines, legislation.
Integrated pest management: Integration of possible components.

CULTURAL CONTROL  
Definition
 	'Manipulation of cultural practices for reducing or avoiding pest damage to crops' is called cultural control. It is also defined as ‘control of pests through adoption of ordinary farm practices in appropriate time in such a way that pests are either eliminated or reduced in population.

The goal of cultural control is to make the crop environment less suitable for pests. Most of the time, cultural control is used as a preventative measure. By anticipating insect problems before they occur, the control techniques avoid or minimize the pest’s impact on the crop. Cultural control techniques are most effective when the target insect pests have few suitable host plants, do not disperse far or frequently, and/or have complex nutritional or environmental requirements during their life cycle.
When using cultural control techniques, it is important to be aware of the environmental context of the field. Production efficiency, yields, soil conservation, natural enemy habitat need to be taken into account for each crop/pest complex, climate, and surrounding environment. This is because cultural control techniques that maximize insect control may at times be impractical in particular contexts. For instance, the practice of tilling to disrupt an underground life stage of an insect pest may not be practical for a no-till farmer trying to reduce erosion on his or her field.


Impact of cultural control
The cultural practices may lead to the control of pest either by directly affecting their growth and multiplication or by minimizing the chance of their attack on plants. The main purpose of cultural control is to make the environment less favourable for the pest and more favourable for its natural enemies.

Strategies for cultural pest control

There are four main strategies for cultural control of pest insects:
Reduce and/or disrupt pest habitat in and around crop
Adjust crop planting to disrupt pest habitat and nutrition requirements
Divert pest population away from crop
Reduce yield loss from insect injury
1) Reduce and/or disrupt pest habitat in and around crop
Pest habitat can include crop residue, spilled seed, weeds along crop edges, volunteer plants, and soil. One technique to reduce or disrupt this habitat is sanitation. Sanitation is important both in the field as well as in storage and processing. Destroying or removing crop residue from the field by plowing, shredding, chopping, burning, or feeding it to livestock can remove or kill insect pests that are inhabiting the residue. This technique can compromise soil conservation, however, as crop residue is a source of soil nutrients and erosion control. Sanitation in storage and processing can be achieved by keeping facilities clean and eliminating spillage. These practices can reduce the spread and population growth of insect pests. Dogs can have head covering to prevent flies and other pest from their ear wounds. Other field sanitation practices include

Stalk and boll destruction against bollworm on cotton.
Destruction of stalks of cereals reduces cereal stem borer infestation 
Collection and burning of blind heads and seeds reduces incidence of the sorghum  midge
Collection and destruction of rotten and dropped fruits controls citrus fruit fly coffee berry-borer etc.
Removal of old cocoa pods after harvest eliminates source of inoculum for the spread of black-pod disease.  It also helps to break the life cycle of certain cocoa insect pests such as the shieldbug .  
Old pods and dead twigs of cocoa are used as nest sites by Pheidole and Crematogaster ant species which are important vectors of black-pod disease.
Collection of rotting vegetable fruits minimizes carry-over infestation by caterpillars of fruit borers and fruit flies.
 Pruning
Collection and burying of fallen fruits can reduce pest of apple and citrus
Destroying or modifying non-crop pest habitat is another technique to reduce or disrupt pest habitat. In Wisconsin, some insect pests overwinter in plants growing around field edges. Burning or plowing plant residue disrupts the habitat for many pests insects and can reduce the number of pests e.g remove maize stalks after harvest, remove all potato from the field after harvest so that they do not stay in the field and act as reservoir for pest and pathogens. It is important to note that destroying this field-edge vegetation removes habitat for natural enemies, and so it is recommended to survey these areas for beneficial insects to determine the value of the vegetation.
A third technique to disrupt pest habitat is tillage. Tillage can reduce some pest populations while attracting others, so it is important to know how your target species responds to tillage and what other pests tillage might put you at risk of attracting. If tillage is timed with a stage of the pest’s life cycle that is underground, it can be used to directly control insect pest populations. For pests that overwinter in the soil, mortality is increased when tillage occurs before a cold winter. The soil disturbance exposes the insect to harsher temperature and soil moisture conditions, reducing the like likelihood of survival. Another technique is crop rotation.
2) Adjust crop planting to disrupt pest habitat and nutrition requirements
Crop planting can be adjusted both in space and time to reduce the development of large pest populations.
Adjusting crop planting in space means making adjustments to where crop plants are relative to each other (density of planting), as well as where they are relative to other crops and unmanaged land. Planting densely so that the crop forms a closed canopy reduces the amount of contrast within a field. Some migrating insect pests are attracted to areas of contrast, so reducing contrast will reduce the attractiveness of a field to these insects. Additionally, dense planting increases humidity, creating a less favorable environment for some pests. At the multi-field scale, locating dissimilar crops next to each other can limit pest movement from field to field. Crops ideal for sharing field borders are those that are susceptible to different pests.
Adjusting crop planting in time means planting a crop at a time when the likelihood of damage from a key pest is reduced. This can be done by waiting one or several growing seasons before planting the same crop in the same place, or by adjusting the date of planting or other field operations around an insect pest’s lifecycle.
 Planting around a pest’s lifecycle can reduce insect damage by avoidance or tolerance. Planting or harvesting a crop before (or after) a pest is present reduces insect damage by avoidance. Trapping and calculating an insect’s growing degree days can assist with planning around a pest’s lifecycle. Damage tolerance can sometimes be achieved by planting a crop early so that the plants are stronger, more resistant, and more tolerant to damage by the time insect pests are present.
3) Divert pest population away from crop
While crops are often suitable hosts for insect pests, they are not always the best host. By creating a small, controlled space that the pests prefer, it is possible to divert pests away from the primary crop. Two techniques for this are trap cropping and strip harvesting.
Trap cropping is planting a preferred host plant of an insect pest near the primary crop that is to be protected. The pest then infests the preferred or “trap” crop instead of the primary crop. If necessary, the pests can then be killed in the trap crop. Trap crops can be any species that the pest prefers—even be the same species as the primary crop. If the trap crop is the same species as the primary crop, it should be planted at a time that will best lure the pest away from the primary crop. Read about push-pull technique

Strip harvesting is the practice of harvesting a crop in sections over time. This practice is useful when harvesting a trap crop because it maintains some habitat for the pest. As a result, the pest does not move to find new habitat in an adjacent higher value or more susceptible crop.
4) Reduce yield loss from insect injury
The techniques already mentioned focus on reducing crop exposure to insect pests, but it is also possible to reduce yield loss even when insect damage happens.
Host tolerance to damage can be optimized by planting genetically resistant and tolerant crop varieties. Also, proper irrigation, fertilization, and weed control can improve plant vigor, reducing yield loss when damage occurs.
Once damage occurs, further yield loss can be prevented by harvesting as early as possible. This works both to prevent further damage by insects, and also to prevent yield loss due to lodging of the plants.

PHYSICAL CONTROL  
Definition
	" Modification of physical factors in the environment to minimize or prevent pest problems" is called physical control.
Physical pest control is also a method of getting rid of insects and small rodents by killing, removing, or setting up barriers that will prevent further destruction of one's plants. These methods are used primarily for crop growing, but some methods can be applied to homes as well.


Impact of physical control
Insects require definite ranges of physical conditions and any departure from such ranges are lethal to the survival and other life activities of insects.

Physical methods in pest management
I. Temperature manipulation
Insect activity and metabolic rate are influenced by environmental temperature. Optimum range of temperature is vital for normal insect activity.
High lethal temperature
    Sun drying of grains - rice weevil
          Hot water treatment of rice seeds at 52-54oC for 15 minutes-white tip 
                                         nematode
          Flaming (flame thrower)-Locusts and moringa hairy caterpillar.
          Steaming (Steam sterilization of soil)- Nematodes in green house.
Low lethal temperature: Cold storage of potatoes - potato tuber moth

II. Moisture manipulation
In well-dried grains (moisture content <10%), the survival of stored grain pests becomes impossible. Eg. Rice weevil, pulse beetle. Alternate wetting and drying in rice fields reduces the brown plant hopper damage

III. Light manipulation
Behavioural orientation is influenced by light. Provision of light causes
1. Mating frequency reduction	- RHC
2. Reduced fertility			-Indian meal moth and
3. Diapause disruption		- All diapausing insects.

Light trapping: It Serves many purposes like monitoring initial infestation, seasonal incidence, pest / weather relationship, pest intensity, pest survey, trapping and killing.

IV. Use of electromagnetic energy
Use of radio frequency (RF) (wave length range is 102-1010µ) affects thoracic ganglion and causes synaptic blocking, alteration of amino compounds of nerve cells and dissolution of nerve cells Eg. Rice weevil
Use of infra red radiation (wave length range 0.78-102µ ) - rice weevil  
Use of visible (0.38-0.78µ) and UV radiation (2 X 10-2 - 0.38µ).  Yellow colour attracts aphids and black colour attracts Angumois grain moth. 
Ionizing radiation-X rays (10-5-10-2µ), gamma rays (10-8 -10-4µ) kill sterilize insects at lethal dose.  

V. Use of sound energy
Acoustical device (Bird scarer/acetylene exploders) produces sudden loud sound which  frighten birds.
Fire crackers also used to make loud sound to scatter away squirrel, foxes, rats, mice, deer, etc.

Disadvantage: Habituation to the sound












MECHANICAL CONTROL  

Definition
	"Use of mechanical force of manual labour either for destruction or exclusion of pests".

Mechanical methods in pest management
Life stages of the pests are killed by mechanical force or manual labour.
I.  Mechanical destruction
A. By manual labour
Hand picking	- Red hairy caterpillar, American boll worm, egg masses of 
  Spodoptera and RHC, tick on livestock
Hooking		- Rhinoceros beetle
Brushing		-Woolen fabrics for cloth moth
Combing		- Delousing for head louse
Crushing		- Bed bugs and lice	
Swatting		- Hit by severe blow against mosquitoes
Sifting		- Sieving for red flour beetle
Shaking plants	- White grub adults, case worm of rice.

B. By mechanical force
Entoleter		       -Centrifugal force is applied to kill insect stages of stored
        grain pests
Hopper dozer	       -Kills nymphs of locusts by herding into trenches and 
         filling with soil
Tillage implements   -Soil borne insects, pupae of many insects.

II. Mechanical exclusion
Mechanical barriers prevent access of pests to hosts.

Banding			-Banding with grease or polythene sheets to control   
  mango mealy bugs
Wrapping		-Covering the fruits with perforated polybags to 
  control pomegranate fruit borer and cloth bag to  
  control fruit pests of grapevine
Covering materials	- Red earth coating on red gram grains to control 
  pulse beetle
Netting			-Mosquito control in house, vector control in green 
  house.
Trenching		-Trapping marching larvae of RHC
Water barrier		- Ant pans for ant control.
Tin barrier		-Metallic sheets fixed around tree trunks in coconut 
  for rat control
Trapping			- Box trap, back break trap, wonder trap for rats.
Electric fencing		- Electrocution checks rat and wild animals.
Insect proof packing	- Stored pests.	

Merits and demerits of mechanical control
Merits
Home labour utilization
Low equipment cost
Ecologically safe
Good component of IPM
	Demerits
Limited application
Require continuous use
Rarely highly effective
Labour intensive



LEGAL CONTROL

Definition
	"Preventing the entry and establishment of foreign plant and animal pests in a country or area and eradication or suppression of pests established in a limited area".

In Cameroon, the Phytosanitary Unit in MINADER works with other ministries to define the framework for legal control of pest

Components of Legal control
1 Plant Quarantine (Foreign quarantine)
	Legal restriction of movements of plants and plant materials between countries and between states within the country to prevent introduction and spread of pests and diseases where they do not exist.

Restrictions on import of plant materials
Scientists can obtain the seeds with permission from competent government agencies (seed bank)
Plant materials should be imported only with import permits.
The consignments should be accompanied by phytosanitary certificate from the country of origin.
Quarantine inspection of materials is made at notified sea and Airports. 
Fumigation of imported plant materials is also done based on need.

2 Domestic quarantine
	While most quarantine operations are designed for cross boarder or international activities, countries with vast surface areas and varying environmental conditions require domestic quarantine. It is the ‘legislation to prevent of spread of already established pests from one part of the country to another’.

 
3. Enforcement of Pest control measures
	It is the legislation to prevent damages and spread of already established pests.	

4. Quality control
	It is the ‘legislation to prevent the adultration and misbranding of insecticides’.	
The Government of Cameroon enforced "Law no. 2003/003 0f April 2003 concerning phytosanitary measures or crop protection practices", which empowers to regulate the import, manufacture, sale, transport, distribution and use of insecticides. 	The pesticide firms should register themselves stating the name and address of manufacturer, the brand and trade name of the insecticide, the active ingredient, net content in an unit pack, details of antidote. The container should carry a poison label with skull and cross bones and a warning or caution statement.
		Central Insecticide Board was set up to advise Centre and States on technical matters of insecticide usage.

5. Legislation to regulate activities of personnel engaged in pest control
It ensures safety to workers engaged in plant protection operations and to public.
