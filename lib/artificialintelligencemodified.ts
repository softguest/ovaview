Introduction To AI
 AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by
 machines, especially computer systems. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and
 technologies that enable computers and software to perform tasks that typically require human
 intelligence.
 These tasks include problem-solving, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns,
 learning from data, making decisions, and even perceiving and interacting with the
 environment.
 Twentieth-century sci-fi movies
 and books
 drove people to fear becoming slaves or being
 destroyed by what is called Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some say we could be wiped out by it.
 Others say it’s impossible for Artificial Intelligence to destroy the human civilization.

LIMITATIONS in AI
 Based on the definition of intelligence
 , Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently unable to
 carry out many of the characteristics such as understanding, self-awareness, learning,
 emotional knowledge or reasoning, feeling... But in very narrow fields, it’s much faster and
 moreaccuratethan humans.
 Though it’s currently not capable of too many things, due to the increase of computer power
 and development of smarter algorithms, Artificial Intelligence is evolving at a very high pace
 and people have high expectations for it in the next few years. It’s a mainstream topic since it
 changes a lot of things in our lives, just like electricity did 100 years ago.
 On a deeper philosophical understanding, not everyone has the skills to be considered
 “intelligent”. Thus it’s possible to compare Artificial
 Intelligence with Human Intelligence.
 A definition of Artificial Intelligence would be a collection of algorithms that imitate human
 reasoning and behavior.

Machine learning
 Machine
 (ML)
 learning (ML) is based on statistical data that is generated by humans and has the same
 effect as memory or experience for humans. In order to train an Artificial Intelligence (AI), you have
 to give it specific and structured data, otherwise, it can’t "learn" anything. All input data must follow
 strict requirements, based on the algorithm used and is only useful for the specific job that it does.
 For example, when you first learn to play Super Mario, you see the player, and you understand
 the environment. You try to achieve a good result by avoiding what you believe will lead you to
 failure and you just enjoy the process of exploring the Mario world. In order to teach an ML
 algorithm
 to play this game, we must provide all inputs in a way it’s capable of "understanding".
 Then it will try almost all possible ways of how to play and how not to play the game, and as a final
 result, it will perform like a pro-Mario player capable of outperforming any other human player.
 Basically, the way our brains think and computer algorithms think are totally different.
 30

32
Main ML algorithm
 ● Supervised learning—the input features and the output labels
 are defined.
 ● Unsupervised learning—the dataset is unlabeled and the goal is to discover hidden 
relationships.
 a. Reinforcement learning— (Learn by Mistake) some form of feedback loop is present 
and there is a need to optimize some parameter.
 b. Recommender Systems: (A recommender systemor a recommendation system (sometimes replacing 
"system" with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict 
the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item)

Reinforcement learning
 Reinforcement Learning is another part of Machine Learning that is gaining a lot of prestige in how it helps 
the machine learn from its progress.
 Reinforcement Learning spurs off from the concept of Unsupervised Learning, and gives a high sphere of 
control to software agents and machines to determine what the ideal behavior within a context can be. 
This link is formed to maximize the performance of the machine in a way that helps it to grow. Simple 
feedback that informs the machine about its progress is required here to help the machine learn its 
behavior.
 Reinforcement Learning(RL) is a type of machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an 
interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.
 Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. Reinforcement. It is about taking suitable 
action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find 
the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation

Indexing with iloc, loc and ix in pandas 
python
 Indexing in pandas python is done mostly with the help of iloc, loc and ix.  lets see an example of each .
 iloc – iloc is used for indexing or selecting based on position .i.e. by row number and column number
 loc – loc is used for indexing or selecting based on name .i.e. by row name and column name
 ix – indexing can be done by both position and name using ix. (NOW DEPRECATED)

Some Data sorting with .loc
 1.
 When selecting multiple columns or multiple rows in this manner, remember that in your selection 
e.g.[1:5], the rows/columns selected will run from the first number to one minus the second number. 
e.g. [1:5] will go 1,2,3,4., [x,y] goes from x to y-1.
 2. Note that .iloc returns a Pandas Series when one row is selected, and a Pandas DataFrame when 
multiple rows are selected, or if any column in full is selected. To counter this, pass a single-valued 
list if you require DataFrame output.
 3. You can make more complex sorting
 79
Handle missing data in your training dataset 
with SciKit Imputer
 ● missing_values —This is the value which has to be replaced in the dataset. This could either be an integer, or NaN. If you don’t pass 
this value, NaN will be the default value. So wherever we have NaN in our dataset, the Imputer object will replace it with a new value.
 ● strategy —This is the strategy we’ll be using to calculate the value which has to replace the NaN occurrences in the dataset. There are
 three different strategies we can use:
 a.
 b.
 c.
 mean
 Median (Center of list)
 Most_frequent
 ● axis—This can take one of two values — 0 and 1. This will decide if the Imputer will apply the strategy along the rows or along the columns. 
0 for columns, and 1 for rows.
 ● verbose—This will just decide the verbosity of the Imputer. By default, it’s set to 0.
 ● copy—This will decide if a copy of the original object has to be made, or if the Imputer should change the dataset in-place. By default, it is 
set to True.

CONCLUSION
 But as stated, a random forest is a collection of decision trees. ... With that said, 
random forests are a strong modeling technique and much more robust than a 
single decision tree. They aggregate many decision trees to limit overfitting as well 
as error due to bias and therefore yield useful results

TensorFlow callback
 TensorFlow callbacks are functions or blocks of code which are executed during a 
specific instant while training a Deep Learning Model1. Available callbacks in 
TensorFlow 2.0 include2:
 EarlyStopping: This callback is used very often.
 ModelCheckpoint: This callback allows us to save the model regularly during training.
 TensorBoard: This is one of the best callbacks if you want to visualize the training 
summary for your model.

ASSETS
 ● Speed (45 frames per second — better than realtime)
 ● Network understands generalized object representation (This allowed them to 
train the network on real world images and predictions on artwork was still 
fairly accurate).
 ● faster version (with smaller architecture) — 155 frames per sec but is less 
accurate.
