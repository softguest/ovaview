            `🚀GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA COMPUTER HARDWARE COMPUTER HARDWARE DEVICE The computer system essentially consists of three components: input devices, central processing unit and output devices. In the computer terminology, a device can be referred as a unit of hardware, which is capable of providing input to the computer or receiving output or both. The input devices are used to provide data to the central processing unit (CPU) for processing. After processing, the input data are converted into meaningful information and this output is presented to the user with the help of output devices. When the term 'device' is used, it includes keyboard, mouse, display monitors, printers and other hardware units. The aim of this chapter is to familiarize you with various types of output and output devices along with their advantages, disadvantages and applications. Learning objectives. At the end of this chapter, student will be able to - - - I. Describe common input and output devices and their functioning Describe common primary and secondary storage devices and their functioning Classify primary and secondary storage devices in order of performance and capacity INPUT DEVICES An input device can be defined as an electromechanical device that allows the user to feed data into the computer for analysis and storage, and to give commands to the computer. The computer accepts input in two ways; manually and directly. In the case of manual data entry, the user enters the data into the computer by hand, for example, by using the keyboard and the mouse. A user can also enter the data directly by transferring information automatically from a source document (like from check using MICR) into the computer. Some of the commonly used input devices are keyboard, pointing devices like mouse and joystick, speech recognition system, digital camera, scanners and so on. I.1 Keying devices These are devices that convert typed numbers, letters and special characters into machine readable form examples: keyboard and keypad I.1.1 Keyboard A keyboard is the most common data entry device. The keyboard is designed like a regular typewriter with a few additional keys. The data are entered into the computer by using various keys. There are different types of keyboard layouts such as QWERTY, DVORAK and AZERTY, but the most common layout is the QWERTY. I.1.2 Keypad This is a small keyboard used with hand held devices i.e. cell phones, calculators, notebooks, etc. I.2 Pointing Devices These are devices used to control the pointer/cursor on the screen. Some commonly pointing devices are: mouse, trackball, joystick, light pen, touch screen and trackpad. I.2.1 Mouse A mouse is a small rectangular-shaped hand-held pointing device, it usually contains two or three buttons, which can be used to input commands or the data. The mouse may be classified as a mechanical mouse or an optical mouse, based on the technology it uses. → A mechanical mouse uses a rubber ball at the bottom surface, which rotates as the mouse is moved along a flat surface to move the cursor. → An optical mouse uses a light beam instead of a rotating ball to detect the movement across a specially patterned mouse pad. I.2.2 Trackball Page 1 CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA GBHS-BAFOUSSAM A trackball is another pointing device that resembles a ball nestled in a square cradle and serves as an alternative to a mouse. In general, the trackball is like a mouse turned upside down. It has a ball, which can be rotated by fingers in any direction, and the cursor moves accordingly. I.2.3 Joystick A joystick is a device that moves in all directions and controls the movement of the cursor. The basic design of a joystick consists of a stick that is attached to a plastic base with a flexible rubber sheath. These plastic base houses a circuit board beneath the stick. I.2.4 Light Pen A light pen (sometimes called a mouse pen) is a hand-held electro-optical pointing device, which when touched or aimed closely at a connected computer monitor will allow the computer to determine the position of the pen on the screen. It images and selects objects on the display screen by directly It is a pen-like device, which is connected to the machine by a I.2.5 Touch Screen facilitates drawing pointing to the objects. cable. A touch screen is a special kind of display screen device, which is placed on the computer monitor to allow direct selection or activation of the computer when the user touches the screen. I.2.6 Trackpad A trackpad (also referred to as touchpad) is a stationary pointing device that works by sensing the movement of fingers across a small sensitive surface and translating them into the pointer movement on the screen. It is generally used in laptops, but can also be connected to the PC through a cord. NOTE: The device manufactured by Apple is referred to as trackpad while the device manufactured by others is known as touchpad. I.3 Scanning devices These are devices that capture data directly into the computer. They can also be defined as devices that use a magnetic or photo-electric source to scan and convert images into electric signals that can be processed by an electronic apparatus, such as a computer. They are commonly used to: - - - - - Convert a text document into an electronic file; Convert a photograph into an electronic graphic file; Sense an image to be sent over a voice frequency Circuit, such as a fax machine; Reproduce text and images, as with a copier. - Scanners are classified according to technology used to capture data namely: optical and magnetic scanners. - - II.3.1 Optical scanners These scanners capture data using optical or light technology. Examples of optical scanners a) Bar Code Reader A bar code is a machine-readable code in the form of parallel vertical lines of varying widths. It is commonly used for labelling goods that are available in super markets and numbering books in libraries. This code is sensed and read by a bar code reader using reflective light. The information recorded in the bar code reader is then fed into the computer, which recognizes the information from the thickness and spacing of the bars. b) Optical mark recognition - Optical mark recognition (OMR) is the process of detecting the intended marked responses. A mark registers significantly less light than presence of the Page 2 CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA GBHS-BAFOUSSAM surrounding paper. The optical mark reading is done by a special device known as optical mark reader. Generally, this technology is used to read answer sheets (MCQ tests). - - c) Optical Character Recognition A scanner converts an input document into an electronic format that can be stored on the disk. If the document to be scanned contains text, optical character recognition (OCR) software is needed to translate the bitmap image of the text to the ASCII codes that the computer can interpret as letters, numbers and special characters. - - d) Scanner A scanner is an input device that converts a document into an electronic format that can be stored on the disk. Moreover, they can store images in both grey scale and colour mode. The two most common types of scanners are hand-held scanner and flat-bed scanner. - → Hand-held Scanner: A hand-held scanner consists of light emitting diodes, which are placed over the document to be scanned. This scanner performs the scanning of the document very slowly from the top to the bottom with its light on. - → Flat-bed Scanner: A flat-bed scanner is similar to a photocopier machine. It consists of a box containing a glass plate on its top and a lid that covers the glass plate. This glass plate is used for placing the document to be scanned. II.3.2 Magnetic scanners These scanners use magnetic technology to capture handwritten and magnetic strip data. Some examples of optical scanners are: a) Magnetic-Ink Character Recognition (MICR): You must have seen special magnetic encoding using characters, printed on the bottom of a check. The characters are printed using a special ink, which contains iron particles that can be magnetized. To recognize these magnetic-ink characters, a magnetic-ink character reader (MICR) is used. It reads the characters by examining their shapes in a matrix form and the information is then passed on to the computer. The banking industry prefers MICR to OCR as the MICR gives extra security against forgeries such as colour copies of payroll checks or hand-altered characters on a check. If a document has been forged, say a counterfeit check produced using a colour photocopying machine, the magnetic-ink line will either not respond to the magnetic fields or will produce an incorrect code when scanned a device designed to recover the information in the magnetic characters. using b) Digital camera: Also known as a digicam, A digital camera stores images digitally rather than recording them on a film. Once a picture has been taken, it can be transferred to a computer system and then manipulated with an image editing software and printed. c) webcam Short form of web camera, is a portable video camera, which captures live video or images that may be viewed in real time over the network or the Internet. It is just a small digital camera that is either in-built in your computer (in most laptops) or can be connected through a USB port. I.4 Other input devices Other input devices of computer include: Touch screen: It is an electronic visual display that can detect the presence and location of a touch within the display area Interactive whiteboard (IWB): This is a large interactive display that connects to a computer and projector. A projector projects the computer's desktop onto the board's surface where users control the computer using a pen, finger, stylus, or other device. The board is typically mounted to a wall or floor stand. Page 3 CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA GBHS-BAFOUSSAM Speech Recognition System: Speech recognition is one of the most interactive systems to communicate with the computer. The user can simply instruct the computer with the help of a microphone (along with speech recognition software) what task to be performed. It is the technology by which sounds, words or phrases spoken by the individuals are converted into digital signals, and these signals are transformed computer generated texts commands. II. OUTPUT DEVICES into or An output device is an electromechanical device, which converts machine-readable information into human readable form. The basic functioning of output device is just the opposite of the input device, that is, the data are 'fed into' the computer system through the input device, while the output is 'taken out' from the computer through the output device. II.1 Types of Output Output is the data that has been processed into useful information. It can be displayed or viewed on a monitor, printed on a printer or listened through speakers or a headset. Generally, there are two basic categories of output: Hard copy output and soft copy output → Hard Copy refers to the recorded information copied from a computer onto the paper or some other durable surface such as microfilm. Hard copy output is permanent and a relatively stable form of output. → Soft Copy is the electronic version of an output, which usually resides in the computer memory and/or on the disk. Unlike hard copy, soft copy is not a permanent form of output and is not tangible, that is, it cannot be touched. II.2 Printers A printer prints information and data from the computer onto a paper. The quality of a printer is determined by its resolution. Resolution is used to describe the sharpness and clarity of an image. The higher the resolution, the better the image. For printers, the resolution is measured in dots per inch (dpi). The more dots per inch, the better will be the quality of image. Printers are divided into two basic categories: impact printers and non impact printers. Impact printers use some sort of physical contact with the paper to make a mark onto it, while non-impact printers use techniques other than to transfer ink onto it. II.2.1 Impact Printers An impact printer uses pins or hammers that press an inked ribbon against the paper to make a mark on the paper. Some impact printers can print only one character at a time, while others can print an entire line. The three most commonly used impact printers are dot matrix printers, daisy wheel printers and drum printers. Some characteristics of impact printers are as follows: • In impact printers, there is physical contact with the paper to produce an image. • They are relatively cheap. The primary recurring costs for these printers are the ink ribbons and paper. • Due to being robust and low cost, they are useful for bulk printing. • They can withstand dusty environment, vibrations and extreme temperature. • They are ideal for printing multiple copies (i.e. carbon copies) because they can easily print through many layers of paper. • Due to its striking activity, the impact printers are very noisy. • Since they are mechanical in nature, they tend to be slow. Page 4 GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA a) Dot Matrix Printers Dot matrix printer (also known as the wire matrix printer) uses the oldest printing technology and it prints one character at a time. It prints characters and images as pattern of dots. The speed of dot matrix printers is measured in characters per second (cps). b) Daisy Wheel Printer Daisy wheel printers produce high-resolution output and are more reliable than dot matrix printers. They can have speed up to 90 cps. However, daisy wheel printers give only alphanumeric output. They cannot print graphics and cannot change fonts unless the print wheel is physically replaced. Daisy wheel printers are slower and more expensive than dot matrix printers. c) Drum Printers The dot matrix and daisy wheel printers are character or serial printers, that is, they print one character at a time. However, drum printer is a line printer; it can print a line in a single operation. Although such printers are much faster than character printers, they tend to be quite loud, have limited multifront capability and often produce lower print quality than most recent printing technologies. Line printers are designed for heavy printing applications. II.2.2 Non-impact Printers In this printer, the print head does not make any contact with the paper, and no inked ribbon is required. Ink can be sprayed against the paper and then heat and pressure are used to fuse a fine black powder into the shape of a character. The major technologies competing in the market of nonimpact printers are ink-jet and laser. Some characteristics of non-impact printers are as follows: • They are faster than impact printers because they have fewer moving parts. • They are quieter than impact printers • They possess the ability to change typefaces automatically. • They produce high-quality graphics. • They cannot print carbon copies. a) Ink-jet Printers An inkjet printer is a printer that places extremely small droplets of ink onto paper to create an image. Ink-jet printers are costlier than dot matrix printers, but the quality is much better. These printers can print any shape of character, which a user can specify as they produce printed output as pattern of tiny dots. Ink-jet printers typically print with a resolution of 600 dpi or more. Due to the high resolution, these printers produce high quality graphics and text printouts. b) Laser Printers A laser printer provides the highest quality text and images for personal computers today. It is a very fast printer, which operates on the same principle as that of a photocopy machine. They are also known as page printers because they process and store the entire page before they actually print it. Today, the resolution of most printers is 600 dpi. They are quiet and fast, able to print 4–32 text-only pages per minute for individual microcomputers and up to 200 pages/min for mainframes (more than 2000 lines/min). Laser printers are often faster than ink-jet printers but are more expensive to buy and maintain than the other printers. Page 5 GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA c) Hydra Printer Hybrid document reproduction apparatus (HYDRA) printer, popularly known as all-in-one printer, is a device that consolidates the capabilities of multiple devices in one machine. It may include some or all of the devices like printer, scanner, photocopier and fax machine. Following are the features that must be considered while evaluating these printers: Print speed, Maximum resolution, Memory card compatibility, Scanner resolution, Fax speed II.3 Plotters A plotter is a pen-based output device that is attached to a computer for making vector graphics, that is, images created by a series of many straight lines. It is used to draw high-resolution charts, graphs, blueprints, maps, circuit diagrams and other line-based diagrams. It is similar to a printer, but it draws lines using a pen. They are mainly used for computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) applications such as printing out plans for houses or car parts. II.4 Monitor The monitor is the most frequently used output device for producing soft copy output. A computer monitor is a TV-like display attached to the computer on which the output can be displayed and viewed. Monitors are available in various sizes like 14, 15, 17, 19 and 21 inches. The larger the size of the monitor, the more expensive it is. The size of the display is described based on two parameters: aspect ratio and screen size. Aspect ratio is the ratio of the width of the display screen to the height, that is, the ratio of vertical points to the horizontal points necessary to produce equal length lines in both directions on the screen. The screen clarity depends on three basic qualities, which are as follows: • Resolution: It refers to the number of pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions on the screen. A pixel (px) is the smallest portion of an image or display that a computer is capable of printing or displaying. In medium-resolution graphics, pixels are large, whereas in high resolution graphics, pixels are small. • Dot Pitch: It is the measurement of the diagonal distance between the two like-coloured (red, green or blue) pixels on a display screen. It is measured in millimetres and common dot pitches are 0.51, 0.31, 0.28, 0.27, 0.26 and 0.25 mm. Smaller the dot pitch, sharper will be the image when displayed on the monitor. Generally, a dot pitch of less than 0.31 mm provides clear images. • Refresh Rate: It is the number of times per second the pixels are recharged so that their glow remains bright. A refresh rate of 60 Hz means the image is redrawn 60 times a second. The higher the refresh rate, the more solid the image looks on the screen, that is, it does not flicker. II.5.1 Cathode Ray Tube Monitors CRT is the electron beams within a monitor that move across your screen either interlaced or non interlaced hitting phosphor dots on the inside glass tube. Within the CRT are three electron guns, red, green, and blue. Each of these guns streams a steady flow of electrons, left to right, for each line of your monitor. II.5.2 Liquid Crystal Display Monitors LCD is a flat display technology used in laptops, cell phones, calculators and, flat screen displays. The LCD is made of two sheets of a flexible polarizing material with a layer of liquid crystal solution between the two. The LCD does not refresh like a traditional CRT monitor, Instead, the display is created by sending various voltages of electricity to cells of liquid crystal causing the liquid crystal to untwist at the rate of electricity applied, generating 64 different shades per cell. Page 6 GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA Comparison between LCD and CRT • Size: An LCD is lightweight and compact, which saves desktop space as compared to a CRT. • Resolution: An LCD is designed to work in a single resolution, while CRT is designed for many resolutions. • Pixel Density: Pixel density of LCD is generally not as tight as the dot pitch in CRT, but for most applications, the density is acceptable. • Brightness: The illuminated phosphor of a CRT is not nearly as bright as what the LCD can produce with its florescent backlight. • Power Consumption: An LCD consumes significantly less power than CRT and has a low emission risk. Typically, the LCD consumes approximately half of the power of a typical CRT. • Cost: Prices for LCD screens are quite high but they are coming down. They are still much more expensive than a CRT. • Viewing Angle: A CRT can be viewed at almost any angle, but an LCD is best viewed 'head on'. • Viewing Area: The frame around the glass screen of the monitor causes the viewable area of the screen to be smaller than an LCD. • Weight: A CRT monitor can weigh 40 pounds or more depending on the size of the monitor. II.5.3 Other Types of Monitors Although CRT and LCD displays are the most commonly used, other kinds of displays also exist. Some of them are as follows: • Plasma Display: A plasma display (also known as thin-panel) is constructed by filling a gas (neon or xenon) between the two glass plates. One glass plate consists of vertical conductors and the other consists of horizontal conductors. The advantage of plasma display is that it has the capability of producing more than 16 million colours and is lighter and less bulky than CRT. However, it is heavier than LCD display and requires more power. • Thin-film Electroluminescent Display: This display is similar to the plasma display except the fact that the space between the glass plates is filled with phosphorescent substance (usually zinc sulphide doped with manganese) instead of gas. The main problem with thin-film electroluminescent displays is that they require more power. II.5. Projectors projector is an output device, which is used to project information from a computer onto a large screen, so that it can be simultaneously viewed by a large group of people. Projection display is commonly used for classroom training or conference room or for multimedia presentations with a large audience. Like monitors, projectors provide a temporary, soft copy output. II.6 Electronic Whiteboard Electronic whiteboard is an interactive presentation device that works electronically to display digital images, drawings and text in different colours. The whiteboard is generally mounted on the wall and is connected to a computer and a projector. The projector projects the computer desktop on the whiteboard and the user can interact with it using electromagnetic pens, fingers or other pointing devices. The electromagnetic pens can be configured to any colour or width. A user can activate programs, applications and menus, as well as can enter text using either onscreen keyboard or handwriting recognition utility. II.7 Headphones and Headsets Headphone is an audio device equipped with a pair of speakers, which are attached to a headstrap worn by the users. For such applications, headset is used instead of headphone. A headset is a combination of one or two speakers and a microphone with both the speaker and the microphone attached to a head strap Page 7 GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA II.8 Terminals Computer terminal is a special unit that can perform as both input and output. A terminal is an I/O device that uses a keyboard for input and a monitor for output. Hence, a terminal is also known as video display terminal (VDT). The terminals can be categorized into the following types • Dumb Terminal: It refers to a terminal that has no processing or programming capabilities. It is designed to communicate exclusively with a host computer. Usually, it consists of a screen and keyboard used to access a host computer. • Smart Terminal: Smart terminal has built-in processing capability and memory, but does not have its own storage capacity. In comparison to the dumb terminal, smart terminal can communicate and retrieve the data and can perform a limited processing of its own, that is, editing or verification of the data. • Intelligent Terminal: An intelligent terminal has memory and in-built microprocessors, hence also known as user-programmable terminal. This terminal can independently perform a certain number of jobs without even interacting with the mainframe. Although they are intelligent terminals, some workstations are designed without disk drives. Due to this, the restricted data cannot be downloaded or copied. III. GENERALITIES ON COMPUTER MEMORY III.1 What is a computer memory? Computer memory is any physical device capable of storing information temporarily or permanently. III.2 Memory representation For measuring computer memory, a standard unit is required. Although the smallest unit of data that a computer can deal with is a bit, the computers generally do not deal with a single bit. Instead, they deal with a group of eight bits, which is referred as 'byte'. Various units used to measure computer memory are as follows: • Bit: It is the smallest unit of data on a machine and a single bit can hold only one of two values: 0 or 1. Bit is represented by lower case b. • A nibble is a collection of 4 bits. • Byte: A unit of eight bits is known as a byte. Hence, a byte is able to contain any binary number between 00000000 and 11111111. It is represented by upper case B. • Kilobyte: In a decimal system, kilo stands for 1000, but in a binary system, kilo refers to 1024. Therefore, a kilobyte is equal to 1024 bytes. It is usually represented as KB. • Megabyte: It comprises 1024 kilobytes or 10,48,576 bytes. However, since this number is hard to remember, a megabyte can be thought of as million bytes. Megabyte is the standard unit of measurement of RAM and is represented as MB. • Gigabyte: It consists of 1024 megabytes (10,73,741,824 bytes). It is the standard unit of measurement for hard disks and is often represented as GB. • Terabyte: It refers to 1024 gigabytes and is often represented as TB. Terabyte memory is usually associated with only super computers Page 8 CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA GBHS-BAFOUSSAM NOTE: In modern computers, groupings of bytes (usually 2 or 4) called computer words can represent larger 'chunks' of information. III.3 Memory characteristics Computer memories can be differentiated by evaluating certain core characteristics. These core characteristics are volatility, mutability, accessibility, and addressability. III.3.1. Volatility → Non-volatile memory will retain the stored information even if it is not constantly supplied with electric power. It is suitable for long-term storage of information. → Volatile memory requires constant power to maintain the stored information. The fastest memory technologies of today are volatile ones. III.3.2. Mutability → Read/write storage or mutable storage allows information to be overwritten at any time. → Read only storage: retains the information stored at the time of manufacture → Write once storage (Write Once Read Many) allows the information to be written only once at some point after manufacture. These are called immutable storage. Examples include CD-ROM and CD-R → Slow write, fast read storage: Read/write storage, which allows information to be overwritten multiple times, but with the write operation being much slower than the read operation. Examples include CD RW and flash memory. III.3.3. Accessibility Access Mode: Access mode refers to the way the data are accessed from the memory. → Random access: Any location in storage can be accessed at any moment in approximately the same amount of time. Such characteristic is well suited for primary and secondary storage. → Sequential access: The accessing of pieces of information will be in a serial order, one after the other; therefore, the time to access a particular piece of information depends upon which piece of information was last accessed. Such characteristic is typical of off-line storage. → Direct access: In some cases, the data are accessed neither in a random nor in a sequential fashion, but using a combination of both the modes. This type of semi-random mode exists in the magnetic disk. III.3.5. Addressability → Location-addressable: Each individually accessible unit of information in storage is selected with its numerical memory address. → File addressable: Information is divided into files of variable length, and a particular file is selected with human-readable directory and file names. In modern computers, secondary, tertiary and off-line storage use file systems. → Content-addressable: Each individually accessible unit of information is selected based on the basis of (part of) the contents stored there. Content-addressable storage can be implemented using software (computer program) or hardware (computer device), with hardware being faster but more expensive option. Hardware content addressable memory is often used in a computer's CPU cache. Other characteristics of computer memory involve • Access time: Access time is the time required between the request made for read/write operation and the time it takes for the completion of the request. Generally, the access time is measured for read operations only. Disk access time depends on the following three parameters: → Seek Time: It is the time required to position the read/write head over the desired track, as soon as a read/write command is received by the disk unit → Latency: It is the time required to spin the desired sector under the read/write head, once the read/write head is positioned on the desired track Page 9 CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA GBHS-BAFOUSSAM → Transfer Rate: the transfer rate is the number of characters or words that a device can transfer per second after it has been positioned at the beginning of the record. As the transfer rate is negligible as compared to seek time and latency, Average access time = Average seek time + Average latency • Storage capacity: Storage capacity refers to the size of the memory, that is, the amount of data that can be stored in the memory. • Cost: The cost of memory is valued by estimating the cost per bit of storage, that is, the cost of a storage unit for a given storage capacity. III.4 Types of Memory These are the fundamental types of memory in a computer system: a) Primary storage device: The primary memory allows the computer to store data for immediate manipulation and to keep track of what is currently being processed. There are two main types of primary storage: - - Main memory (RAM and ROM) and Internal processor memories (Cache memory and registers). b) Secondary Memory: This is also known as auxiliary memory. It differs from primary storage in that it is not directly accessible by the CPU. c) Tertiary Storage: Tertiary storage is very large storage which is separate from the computer. The most obvious example of tertiary storage is an automated storage facility where mechanical arms retrieve media and load it into large computers. Other tertiary storage may simply be off-grounds locations which allow vital data in various mediums to be safe-guarded for security purposes- fire, theft, etc. d) Off-line Storage: Offline storage is storage media which can be inserted into the computer and used but which can then be removed from the computer and stored elsewhere. Floppy drives, CD drives, and DVD drives might also alternately be considered secondary storage because their drives are usually installed in the computer but the key here is the media the data is stored on. III.5 Storage technologies Most commonly used data storage technologies are semiconductor, magnetic, and optical, while paper still sees some limited usage. Some other fundamental storage technologies have also been used in the past or are proposed for development.  Magnetic storage media: Magnetic storage uses different patterns of magnetization on a magnetically coated surface to store information. In modern computers, magnetic storage will take these forms: Magnetic disk (Floppy disk, Hard disk drive) and Magnetic tape data storage.  Optical storage media: The typical optical disc, stores information in deformities on the surface of a circular disc and reads this information by illuminating the surface with a laser diode and observing the reflection.  Semiconductor storage media: Semiconductor memory uses semiconductor-based integrated circuits to store information. A semiconductor memory chip may contain millions of tiny transistors or capacitors. Both volatile and non-volatile forms of semiconductor memory exist.  Magneto-optical disc storage media: Magneto-optical disc storage is optical disc storage where the magnetic state on a ferromagnetic surface stores information. The information is read optically and written by combining magnetic and optical methods. Page 10 GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA III.6 Memory hierarchy A "memory hierarchy" in computer storage distinguishes each level in the "hierarchy" by response time. Since response time, complexity, and capacity are related, the levels may also be distinguished by the controlling technology. The figure below illustrates the memory hierarchy. IV. PRIMARY STORAGE DEVICE The primary memory allows the computer to store data for immediate manipulation and to keep track of what is currently being processed. There exist two main types of primary storage device: Main memories and internal processor memories II.1 Main memory Broadly primary memory can be of two types RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read only memory). Every computer comes with a small amount of ROM, which contains the boot firmware called BIOS (Basic Input Output System). II.1.1 Random Access Memory (RAM) 1. What is RAM? RAM is the place where the computer temporarily stores its operating system, application programs and current data so that the computer's processor can reach them quickly and easily. RAM allows the computer to store data for immediate manipulation and to keep track of what is currently being processed. RAM is much faster to read from and write to than the other kinds of storage in a computer (like hard disk or floppy disk). The major limitation of this type of memory is that it is volatile. It means that when the power is turned off, the contents of the primary memory are lost forever. NOTE: Random access memory is also called read/write memory because, unlike read-only memory (ROM) that does not allow any write operation, random access memory allows CPU to read as well as write data and instructions into it. 2. Types of RAM There are two types of random-access memory, which are as follows: a) Dynamic RAM (DRAM): This RAM must be continually refreshed (pulse of current through all the memory cells) to maintain the data. This is done by placing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred times per second. DRAM is used for most system memory because it is cheap and small. Some of the most popular DRAM technologies are briefed as follows: • Fast Page Mode DRAM (FPM DRAM): It is also called as page mode DRAM. It is the original form of DRAM. FPM DRAM is slow and has an access time of 60–120 ns. Due to its slow speed, FPM DRAM is replaced by EDO RAM. • EDO (Extended Data Output) RAM: In an EDO RAMs, any memory location can be accessed. It is 10–15 per cent faster than FPM DRAM and is usually found on 66 MHz motherboards. EDO memory further enhances the method of access. • Burst Extended Data Output DRAM (BEDO DRAM): Original EDO RAM was too slow for the newer systems being developed at that time. Therefore, a new method of memory access, known as bursting, had to be developed to speed up the memory access. • SDRAM (Synchronous DRAMS), It is the most common type of RAM used in systems today. This implies that the data stored in the memory is refreshed at system speed. Also, the data are accessed in memory at system speed. SDRAM employs the bursting technology to improve the performance. • DDR-SDRAM (Double Data Rate – SDRAM): This DRAM is similar to SDRAM except that it has higher bandwidth, which means greater speed. Therefore, the transfer rate of the data becomes doubles. Page 11 GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA • Rambus DRAM (RDRAM): It was developed by Rambus, Inc. and endorsed by Intel as the successor to SDRAM. b) Static RAM (SRAM): This RAM retains the data as long as power is provided to the memory chip. It need not be 'refreshed' periodically. It is very fast but much more expensive than DRAM. SRAM is often used as cache memory due to its high speed. SRAM comes in following types: • Asynchronous SRAM (ASRAM): It is an older type of SRAM used in many PCs for L2 cache, which works independently of the system clock. Thus, the CPU must wait for data requested. • Burst SRAM (BSRAM): Burst SRAM (also known as Synch Burst SRAM or synchronous SRAM) is synchronized with the system clock. This allows it to be more easily synchronized with any device that accesses it and the access time is also less. However, it is expensive. • Pipeline Burst SRAM (PB SRAM): PB SRAM requests are pipelined; larger packets of data are sent to the memory at once and acted on very quickly. This type of SRAM is often used because it can operate at speeds higher than 66 MHz 3. Main memory organisation The main memory of computer system is organized into an array of small storage areas known as cells, which are serially linked together. Each cell is indexed by a unique number, called the address of the cell and is capable of storing a fixed number of bits, called the word length of the memory. The word length is an important architectural factor, which typically relates to the CPU and is usually the size of its registers in bits. The word lengths typically range from 8, 16, 32 bits to 64 bits and accordingly the computers are termed as 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit computers. The higher the word length, the more powerful a computer is. The total number of memory cells that can be uniquely addressed by CPU depends on the total number of address lines in an address bus. If there are n lines in the address bus then there are 2n addressable locations in the memory. 4. Fixed and Variable Word Length Memory The main memory of a computer can be designed in two ways: fixed word length and variable word length. → In fixed word length memory system, each memory location stores a fixed number of characters, which are equal to the word length of the computer. The computers that employ fixed word length memory approach are called word-addressable computers. In such computers, the storage space is always allocated in multiples of word length. → In variable word length memory system, the memory is designed in such a way that each memory location can store only one character. Hence, the word 'HI' will occupy only 2 bytes, 'MIKE' will occupy 4 bytes, and 'COMPUTER' will occupy 8 bytes of memory. The computers that employ variable word length memory approach are called characteraddressable computers II.1.2 Read Only Memory 1. What is ROM? Short for Read-Only Memory, ROM is a type of "built-in" memory that is capable of holding data and having that data read from the chip, but not written to. Unlike Random Access Memory (RAM), ROM is non-volatile which means it keeps its contents regardless if it has power or not. NB: The term ROM is used to describe any type of memory or media that is read only. For example, a CD-ROM Page 12 GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA 2. Types of ROM Memories in the ROM family are distinguished by the methods used to write data on them and the number of times they can be rewritten. There are different types of ROMs, which are as follows: • Masked ROM: The very first ROMs, known as masked ROMs, were hard-wired devices that contained a pre-programmed set of data or instructions. • Programmable ROM (PROM): This form of ROM is initially blank. The user or manufacturer can write data/program on it by using special devices. However, once the program or data is written in PROM chip, it cannot be changed. • Erasable Programmable ROM (EPROM): An EPROM is programmed in exactly the same manner as a PROM. However, unlike PROMs, an EPROM can be erased and reprogrammed repeatedly. It can be erased by simply exposing it to a strong source of ultraviolet (UV) light for a certain amount of time. • Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM): This type of ROM can be erased by an electrical charge and then written to by using slightly higher-than-normal voltage. EEPROM can be erased one byte at a time, rather than erasing the entire chip with UV light. Hence, the process of re-programming is flexible, but slow. • Flash ROM: flash ROM, also called flash BIOS or flash memory, is a type of ROM that can be erased and re-programmed in blocks. II.2 Internal Processor Memories These memories are placed within the CPU (processor) or is attached to a special fast bus. Internal memory usually includes cache memory and special registers, both of which can be directly accessed by the processor. This memory is used for temporary storage of data and instructions on which the CPU is currently working. Processor memory is the fastest among all the memories, but is most expensive also. II.2.1 Cache Memory Cache memory is used by the central processing unit of a computer to reduce the average time to access memory. The cache is a smaller, faster memory which stores copies of the data from the most frequently used main memory locations. As long as most memory accesses are to cached memory locations, the average latency of memory accesses will be closer to the cache latency than to the latency of main memory. The advantage of cache memory is that the CPU does not have to use the motherboard’s system bus for data transfer. Whenever data must be passed through the system bus, the data transfer speed slows to the motherboard’s capability. The CPU can process data much faster by avoiding the bottleneck created by the system bus. Cache memory is sometimes described in levels of closeness and accessibility to the microprocessor. There are three main types of cache memory: → L1 cache: It is small and is built inside the CPU. It is fast as compared to L2 cache → L2 cache: It is large but slower and is mounted on the motherboard → Most computers today come with L3 cache which is built out of the CPU Page 13 GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA II.2.2 Registers The central processing unit (CPU) contains a number of memory locations which are individually addressable and reserved for specific purpose. These memory locations are called registers. CPU instructions operate on these values directly. Registers are at the top of the memory hierarchy, and provide the fastest way for a CPU to access data. On RISC processors, all data must be moved into a register before it can be operated. On CISC (Intel) chips, there are a few operations that can load data from RAM, process it, and save the result back out, but the fastest operations work directly with registers. The number of registers that a CPU has and the size of each (number of bits) help determine the power and speed of a CPU. For example a 32-bit CPU is one in which each register is 32 bits wide. Therefore, each CPU instruction can manipulate 32 bits of data. Some characteristics of CPU registers are: • Very fast (access times of a few nanoseconds) • Low capacity (usually less than 200 bytes) • Very limited expansion capabilities (a change in CPU architecture would be required) Expensive (more than one dollar/byte) Types of register Types of Registers are as Followings → Memory Address Register(MAR) : This register holds the memory addresses of data and instructions. This register is used to access data and instructions from memory during the execution phase of an instruction. → Program Counter (PC): It holds the address of the memory location of the next instruction when the current instruction is executed by the microprocessor. → Accumulator Register: This Register is used for storing the Results those are produced by the System. When the CPU will generate Some Results after the Processing then all the Results will be Stored into the AC Register. → Memory Data Register (MDR) : MDR is the register of a computer's control unit that contains the data to be stored in the computer storage (e.g. RAM), or the data after a fetch from the computer storage. → Index Register (IR) : Also known as base register. An index register in a computer's CPU is a processor register used for modifying operand addresses during the run of a program. → Memory Buffer Register (MBR): This register holds the contents of data or instruction read from, or written in memory. It means that this register is used to store data/instruction coming from the memory or going to the memory. → Data Register: A register used in microcomputers to temporarily store data being transmitted to or from a peripheral device. V. SECONDARY STORAGE DEVICES This is also known as auxiliary memory. It differs from primary storage in that it is not directly accessible by the CPU. The secondary memory provides backup storage for instructions (computer programs) and data. The instructions and data stored on secondary storage devices are permanent in nature. They can only be removed if the user wants it so or the device is destroyed. III.1 Magnetic Tape Magnetic tape is a recording medium consisting of a thin tape with a coating of a fine magnetic material, used for recording analogue or digital data. Data is stored in frames across the width of the tape. The frames are grouped into blocks or records which are separated from Page 14 GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA other blocks by gaps. Magnetic tape is a serial access medium, similar to an audio cassette, and so data (like the songs on a music tape) cannot be quickly located. However large amounts of information can be stored within magnetic tape. This characteristic has prompted its use in the regular backing up of hard disks. Advantages and disadvantage of Magnetic Tapes The following are advantages and disadvantages of magnetic tape Advantages of magnetic tape Disadvantages of magnetic tape Probably the cheapest form of storage per megabyte of storage Serial access so can be quite slow to access data Can store large amounts of data - up to 1 Terabyte per tape cartridge Need a special piece of equipment to record and read the data on the tape Can be set up to do the back up overnight or over the weekend The data may be corrupted if the tape is placed near a strong magnetic field e.g. a large speaker or magnet They are portable because they are compact in size, lightweight and removable. the data on such devices are difficult to recover even if a minor bit error occurs. They are not flexible as compared to other media types when file updating requires record insertion or deletion. III.2 Magnetic Disk III.2.1 What is a Magnetic Disk? The magnetic disks are the most widely used and popular medium for direct access secondary storage. They offer high storage capacity and reliability and have capability to access the stored data directly. A magnetic disk comprises a thin piece of plastic/metal circular plate/platter, which is coated with a magnetic oxide layer. The data are represented as magnetized spots on the disk. Data are recorded on the disk in the form of tiny invisible magnetized and non-magnetized spots (representing 1s and 0s) on the coated surfaces of the disk III.2.2 Storage Organization of a Magnetic Disk A disk’s surface is divided into a number of invisible concentric circles called tracks the tracks are numbered consecutively from outermost to innermost starting from zero. The number of tracks on a disk may be as few as 40 on small, low-capacity disks, to several thousand on large, high-capacity disks. Each track of a disk is subdivided into sectors There are 8 or more sectors per track. A sector typically contains 512 bytes. Disk drives are designed to read/write only whole sectors at a time. The track sectors are grouped into a collection known as cluster. It refers to the basic allocation unit for storage on a disk, consisting of one or more-track sectors. The number of track sectors that make up one cluster depends on the type and size of the media. The term 'cluster' also refers to the minimum amount of disk space used by a single file. Even if the file occupies only part of a cluster, the entire cluster is allocated to the file and marked as used space. III.2.3 Disk formatting Disk formatting is the process of preparing a new disk by the computer system in which the disk is to be used. There exist two type of formatting: a) Low-level disk formatting - Disk drive’s read/write head lays down a magnetic pattern on the disk’s surface Page 15 GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA - Enables the disk drive to organize and store the data in the data organization defined for the disk drive of the computer b) OS-level disk formatting - - - Creates the File Allocation Table (FAT) that is a table with the sector and track locations of data Leaves sufficient space for FAT to grow Scans and marks bad sectors III.2.4 Master Boot Record (MBR) The Master Boot Record, created when you create the first partition on the hard disk, is probably the most important data structure on the disk. It is the first sector on every disk. The location is always track (cylinder) 0, side (head) 0, and sector 1.The Master Boot Record contains the Partition Table for the disk and a small amount of executable code. The Master Boot Record then finds the system partition's starting location on the disk, and loads a copy of its Partition Boot Sector into memory. The Master Boot Record then transfers execution to executable code in the Partition Boot Sector. III.2.5 Storage Capacity of a Magnetic Disk Several parameters must be considered while finding out the capacity of a magnetic disk. These parameters include number of recording surfaces, number of tracks per surface, number of sectors per track and number of bytes per sector. Therefore, one can define storage capacity of a disk as a multiple of all the above parameters. No. of disk platters = 4, No. of usable surfaces = 6. A set of corresponding tracks on all the 6 surfaces is called a cylinder. Storage capacity of a disk system = Number of recording surfaces x Number of tracks per surface x Number of sectors per track x Number of bytes per sector III.2.6 Advantages of Magnetic Disks → More suitable than magnetic tapes for a wider range of applications because they support direct access of data → Random access property enables them to be used simultaneously by multiple users as a shared device. → Suitable for both on-line and off-line storage of data → the cost per bit of storage is low for magnetic disks. → An additional cost benefit is that magnetic disks can be erased and reused many times → Floppy disks and zip disks are compact and light in weight. Hence, they are easy to handle and store. → Very large amount of data can be stored in a small storage space Page 16 CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA GBHS-BAFOUSSAM → Data transfer rate for a magnetic disk system is normally higher than a tape system III.2.7 Limitations of Magnetic Disks → A disk crash or drive failure often results in loss of entire stored data. It is not easy to recover the lost data. → Some types of magnetic disks are not so easily portable like magnetic tapes → the cost of magnetic disks is low, but the cost of magnetic tapes is even lower → Must be stored in a dust-free environment → They possess slow data access speed as compared to the magnetic disks. III.2.8 Types of Magnetic Disk All magnetic disks come in the form of round platters. These disks are available in different sizes, shapes and designs. Some are attached to the read/write head assembly, whereas some are available in the form of removable disks. Broadly, magnetic disks can be classified into three types: floppy disk, hard disk and zip disk. 1) Floppy disks A floppy disk, or diskette, is a disk storage medium composed of a disk of thin and flexible magnetic storage medium, sealed in a rectangular plastic carrier lined with fabric that removes dust particles. Floppy disks are read and written by a floppy disk drive (FDD). Floppy diskettes are small, inexpensive, readily available, easy to store and have a good shelf life, if stored properly. The two types of floppy disks in use today are: → 5¼-inch diskette, whose diameter is 5¼-inch. It is encased in a square, flexible vinyl jacket → 3½-inch diskette, whose diameter is 3½-inch. It is encased in a square, hard plastic jacket Size (Diameter in inches) N° of surfaces N° of tracks N° of sectors/tracks N° of bytes/sector 5 ¼ 2 40 9 512 Capacity in bytes Approximate capacity 3 ½ 368640 2 80 36 512 360 KB 3 ½ 2949120 2 80 18 2.88 MB 512 1474560 1.44 MB 2) Hard disk A hard disk drive (HDD) is a data storage device used for storing and retrieving digital information using rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material. An HDD retains its data even when powered off. Data is read in a random-access manner, meaning individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order rather than sequentially. An HDD consists of one or more rigid ("hard") rapidly rotating disks (platters) with magnetic heads arranged on a moving actuator arm to read and write data to the surfaces. Depending on how they are packaged, hard disks are of three types: Zip/Bernoulli disks, Disk packs, Winchester disks 3) Zip disk A Zip drive is a small, portable disk drive used primarily for backing up and archiving personal computer files. Zip drives and disks come in two sizes. The 100 megabyte size actually holds 100,431,872 bytes of data or the equivalent of 70 floppy diskettes. There is also a 250-megabyte drive and disk. III.3 Optical Disk III.3.1 What is an Optical Disk? Page 17 GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA An optical disk is a storage medium from which data is read and to which it is written by lasers. The typical optical disc, stores information in deformities on the surface of a circular disc and reads this information by illuminating the surface with a laser diode and observing the reflection. The optical disk storage system consists of a rotating disk coated with a thin layer of metal (aluminium, gold or silver) that acts as a reflective surface and a laser beam, which is used as a read/write head for recording the data onto the disk. There are three basic types of optical disks:  CD-ROM : Like audio CDs, CD-ROMs come with data already encoded onto them. The data is permanent and can be read any number of times, but CD-ROMs cannot be modified.  WORM : Stands for write-once, read -many. With a WORM disk drive, you can write data onto a WORM disk, but only once. After that, the WORM disk behaves just like a CD-ROM.  Erasable: Optical disks that can be erased and loaded with new data, just like magnetic disks. These are often referred to as EO (erasable optical) disks. III.3.1 Types of Optical Disks a) Compact Disk Compact disk is the most popular and the least expensive type of optical disk. It was originally intended only for storing music (in the form of digital audio) and can record about 80 minutes of uninterrupted playing time. A CD is capable of being used as a data storage device along with storing of digital audio. Compact disks are available in various formats: CD-ROM (compact disk-read-only memory), CD-R (compact disk recordable) and CD-RW (compact disk-rewritable) disks. - - - A CD-ROM disk comes with pre-recorded data by the manufactures and can be read but cannot be altered. CD-R is a type of WORM (write once-read many) disk that allows you to record your own data. Once written, the data on the CD-R can be read but cannot be altered. A CD-RW disk is rewritable version of CD-R, which means, it allows writing, erasing and rewriting of the data several times. The data recorded on all CD formats can be read using the CD-ROM drive; however, to write data on CD-R and CD-RW disks, one needs a special peripheral device known as CD-writer (or CD-burner) b) Digital Versatile Disk DVD, initially called digital video disk, is a high-capacity data storage medium. NOTE: Like CDs, DVDs are also available in different formats: DVD-ROM, DVD-R and DVDRW. c) Blu-ray Disk A Blu-ray Disc is a high-density optical disc storage medium, which is used for the storage of all high-definition digital formats like audio, video, and play-station games and so on. They have the same physical appearance as a DVD. The name “BLU-RAY” is actually a combination of the colour “blue” and “ray”. Here blue refers to the blue colour of the laser that is used for its reading and ray refers to the optical ray. Like CDs and DVDs, Blu-ray disks are also available in different formats: • BD-ROM: It comes with pre-recorded content that can only be read. • BD-R: It is a WORM type of disk on which you can record data only once. • BD-RW: It is similar to BD-R disk, but the difference is that it is rewritable. This means that the data can be erased and recorded a number of times on the same disk. • BD-RE: It is also a rewritable disk, but is used only for high-definition audio/video and television recording Blu-Ray Disc (BD) vs DVD • Both of them have the same physical appearance. [Thickness = 1.2 mm] • The single layer Blu-ray disc can store up to 27 GB data. A single layer DVD can hold only 4.7 GB of data. • A DVD needs two substrates and they should be bonded. But a Blu-ray disc requires only one substrate. Page 18 GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA • The production cost of Blu-ray is lesser than that of a DVD because there is no need for bonding of substrates. • The Blu-Ray disc uses violet-blue laser with improved lens specifications, while a DVD uses red laser. III.4 Magneto-Optical Disk As implied by the name, these disks use a hybrid of magnetic and optical technologies. A magnetooptical disk writes magnetically (with thermal assist) and reads optically using the laser beam. A magneto-optical disk drive is so designed that an inserted disk will be exposed to a magnet on the label side and to the light (laser beam) on the opposite side. III.5 Memory Stick Memory Stick also known as 'Memory Card' is a digital storage device, which is designed to be used with portable electronic devices such as mobile phone, digital camera, PDA, iPod and so on. It was launched in 1998 by Sony and immediately gained popularity due to its support for fast data transfer speed and large storage capacity. Nowadays, several different standards or formats of Memory Stick are available in the market, which are as follows: • Memory Stick PRO (SP): It supports marginally higher data transfer speed than the original one and provides theoretical storage capacity of up to 32 GB • Memory Stick Duo (SD): It is a small size Memory Stick for small, pocket-sized devices such as mobiles, music players, digital cameras, and so on. • Memory Stick PRO Duo: Although Memory Stick Duo fulfils the need of smaller memory card for pocket-sized devices, it is superseded by Memory Stick PRO Duo because of its slow transfer rate and limited storage capacity of 128 MB. Memory Stick PRO Duo provides larger memory space (up to 32 GB) and high speed of data transfer to/from the card. • Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo: Unlike Memory Stick PRO which has a parallel interface of 4 bits, Memory Stick PRO HG Duo has 8-bit parallel interface. In addition, the clock frequency has increased from 40 to 60 MHz in the Memory Stick Pro-HG Duo. • Memory Stick Micro (M2): It is a light and compact storage medium, which comes in the dimension of 15 × 12.5 × 1.2 mm3. It offers large storage capacity ranging from 16 MB to 32 GB and transfer speed of 160 Mb/s. III.6 Universal Serial Bus Universal Serial Bus (USB) (developed by Intel) is a set of connectivity specification that establishes communication between personal computers and devices such as mouse, keyboard, pen drive and external hard disk drives. a) Pen Drive The flash drive is a high storage (ranging from 1 to 512 GB) capacity device and is physically small enough to fit into a pocket. In addition, it is fast, robust and reliable, and requires very less power to operate, which it gets through USB port and hence no battery is required. b) External Hard Disk Drive External hard disk drive is a type of hard drive that resides in its own enclosure (called hard drive cage) outside the computer case and is connected to the system through Page 19 GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA Page 20 interfaces like USB. The internal structure and functioning of external hard disk drive is similar to the internal hard disk drive. Hence, external hard disk drive is a reliable and high-capacity storage media. In addition, it is portable and provides plug and play feature. III.7 Mass Storage Devices To get a vast amount of storage capacity in a computer system, a different kind of storage system is used. In such type of system, multiple units of similar kinds of storage media are associated together to form a chain of mass storage devices. These storage media may include multiple magnetic tape reels or cartridges, multiple arrays of magnetic disks or multiple CD-ROMs as storage devices. However, they have huge amount of storage capacity and possess minimum cost per bit storage. Mass storage devices are cost-effective option to the online tapes and disks storage in situations where large storage capacity is required and where prompt data access is not essential. When used as offline storage, they are referred as an archival storage. Broadly speaking, mass storage devices are categorized into three types: • Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID): The basic idea of RAID is to combine multiple hard disks into an array of disk drives to obtain high performance, large capacity and reliability. These arrays of drives appear to the host computer as a single logical drive. • Automated Tape Library: An automated tape library comprises numerous sets of magnetic tapes along with their drives and controllers mounted in a single unit. The unit comprises one or more tape drives to perform read/write operations on the tapes in the tape library. • CD-ROM Jukebox: A CD-ROM jukebox comprises numerous sets of CD-ROM disks along with their drives and controllers mounted in a single unit. The unit comprises one or more CD-ROM drives to perform read/write operations on the CD-ROM in the jukebox. In the multiple CD-ROM drive environments, these CD ROMs can be simultaneously read or written, resulting in the speedy rate of data transfer. EXERCISE ON HARDWARE 1. When referring to storage devices name the two types of access and describe how they operate? 2. A mail order company keeps details of transactions stored on magnetic disc. A backup copy is also held on magnetic tape. i) Why does the company make a backup copy of the transactions? ii) Why can the company hold the back up on tape and not need to use disc? 3. Fred saves his report to disc and decides to print it out using the school’s laser printer. The school has the same type of pc as Fred and uses the same type and format of disc. However, Fred finds he cannot load his report on the school computer. Why is this? 4. Describe the differences between hard disc, CD ROM and WORM as methods of backing store? 5. Staff in a store carry out a stock check every week and input the data using OCR. The store is considering using palm top computers for the stock checks. Suggest 2 advantages palm tops have over OCR forms? 6. Sandie buys a new computer. It is described as a multimedia computer. Suggest one input and one output device it may have to warrant this description? Question [Special mock 2 Feb 2014 PCHS Bamenda] 1.

INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE I.1 Definition of software Software, by definition, is the collection of computer programs, procedures and documentation that performs different tasks on a computer system. It actually tells the computer what to do and how to do it. Software may enter the computer through one of following three ways. (i) (ii) (iii) I may be build into the computer circuit in the form of firmware. It may be loaded into the computer from a secondary storage device such as CD ROM or hard disk drives It is also be typed into the computer with the aid of the keyboard and programming tools I.2 Relation between hardware and software Software refers to the computer programs that are loaded into a computer system, and hardware refers to all the visible devices, which are assembled together to build a computer system. The blending of software and hardware gives life to a computer system. Even though hardware is the physical part of a computer, it is nothing unless it has software to control it. Hardware and software then share a special relationship. If hardware is the 'heart' of a computer system, software is its 'soul'. Both are complimentary to each other. Hardware is of no use without software and software cannot be used without hardware. I.3 Ways of acquiring computer software Software can enter the computer through different channels. Some of the common ways of acquiring computer software include: (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) II. Buying the computer: when you buy a new computer from the shop, you are usually supplied with some software for free, from the computer manufacturer Buying the software from a shop: Downloading the software from a website for free (freeware) or after paying some money to the vendor Ordering from the vendor either by email, fax or postal letter. Here you also need to pay for the product before it is sent to you. Copying from other people’s machines: This is what most Cameroonians do and it is what referred to as software piracy. Software piracy is illegal and therefore punishable by law CLASSIFICATION OF SOFTWARE Computer software can be organized into categories based on common function, task, or field of use. We can then categorize software in different ways. II.1 Classification of software based on task GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA Based on the kind of task they perform, software can be divided into two major groups: System software and application software. The diagram below gives a simplified hierarchical organization of the main parts of software in a general-purpose computer. At the highest level of this hierarchy lies the application software, whose services are carried out by the underlying system software. Computers operate by executing software programs. This involves passing the instructions from the application software, through the system software to the hardware that ultimately receives the instruction as machine code. Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation such as data transmission, data processing, data storage or data control. II.1.1 System software System software is a type of computer software that controls the operation of the computer and provides facilities that extend the general capabilities of the machine. This provides the basic functions for computer usage and helps to run the computer hardware and system. It includes a combination of the following: 1) Operating system An operating system is a group of computer programs that coordinates all the activities among computer hardware devices. This is the most important type of system software in a computer. A user can’t run an application program on the computer except it is self booting without the Operating System. Operating systems are contained in almost all devices including mobile phones. (to be extended in the next chapter) Functions of an operating system An operating system executes many functions to operate computer system efficiently. Among them, four essential functions are the followings.  Resource Management: An operating system manages a collection of computer hardware resources by using a variety of programs. It manages CPU, primary memory, virtual memory, secondary storage devices, input/output peripherals, and other devices.  Task Management: The function of the operating system that controls the running of many tasks. It manages one program or many programs within a computer system simultaneously. That is, this function of operating system manages the completion of users' tasks.  File management: This is a function that manages data files. An operating system contains file management programs that provide the ability to create, delete, enter, change, ask, and access of files of data. The operating system keeps track of where files are located on the hard drive through the type of file system. The type two main types of file system most used in windows OS are File Allocation table (FAT) or New Technology File system (NTFS).  User Interface: It is a function of an operating system that allows users to interact with a computer. The two main types of user interfaces are: command line and a graphical user interface (GUI). With a command line interface, the user interacts with the operating system by typing commands to perform specific tasks. An example of a command line interface is DOS (disk operating system). GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA Examples of popular modern operating systems include Android, BSD, iOS, Linux (ubuntu, Knoppix, Dreamlinux, …) OS X, QNX, Microsoft Windows(Windows 95, 2000, Vista, 7, 8, …), Windows Phone, and IBM z/OS. All these, except Windows, Windows Phone and z/OS, share roots in UNIX. 2) Utility program This is system software designed to help analyse, configure, optimise or maintain a computer. A single piece will be called a utility or tool. Some Well-known utility software include:  Antivirus programs: They are used to detect and eliminate computer viruses and related malicious software. Some examples are: avast, AVG, Avira, BitDefender, Norton  Backup programs: They help to make copies of all information valuable to a computer or information system and store it safe. The information can be restored in the event of disk failure or other accidents that will lead to data loss.  Data Recovery: As the name implies, data recovery programs are used to recover data. Since disk drives or other hardware may fail, these utilities are essential to recover data in such a scenario.  Data Compression programs: They make the data more compact, reducing the space occupied by the data.  Disk management program : These are program involving formatting and arranging disk files in an orderly manner.  Memory management software : It handles locations in RAM where data put their current data. It can move certain memory-resident items out of the way so as to increase the memory space.  The Server: In the context of client-Server architecture, a server is a computer program running to serve the requests of other programs – “the clients”. The clients may run on the same systems or through networks. 3) Programming software It is the type of software that is used for creating other software. Another name for programming software is Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE normally consist of a source code editor, a translator (compiler or interpreter) and a debugger. - - - Editor: It is a programming tool that is used for creating and modifying application programs. It helps the computer user to enter, search, delete, replace, copy and insert text or sections of a text in a desired position. Compiler: It is used to convert a complete program written in a high-level language (such as Pascal and C) into a program in machine language. Interpreter: A program which translates the program statements into machine language one line at a time as the program is running. GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA - - - - Assembler: A programming tool that convert a program in assembly language into program in machine language. Debugger: It is a program that is used for locating and correcting programming errors. Linker: A linker or link Editor is a program that takes one or more objects generated by the compiler and combines them to a single executable program.. Loader: Loader is a kind of system software, which is responsible for loading and relocation of the executable program in the main memory. The functions of a loader include assigning load time space for storage, that is, storage allocation and assisting a program to execute appropriately. 4) Device driver Device drivers are computer programs that allow higher level computer programs to communicate and interact with a hardware device. All hardware devices have the devices drivers that communicate with them through the computer bus to which the hardware is connected. Drivers are hardware dependent and operating system specific. Some specific categories of device drivers are Logical Device Drivers (LDD) which are written by the Operating System vendors Physical Device Drivers (PDD) which are written and implemented by the hardware vendor. To solve device driver crises, Microsoft has created the Windows Drivers Foundation (WDF) which collects and keeps all device drivers as a database. II.1.2 Application software Although system software has the vital job of controlling and managing the computer, it is the application software that lets you carry out the tasks for which the system was purchased. It enables the end users to accomplish certain specific tasks. Business software, databases and educational software are some forms of application software. Different word processors, which are dedicated to specialized tasks to be performed by the user, are other examples of application software. a) General purpose software A general purpose application, sometimes known as ‘off-the-shelf’ is the sort of software that you use at home and school. Examples include word processors, spreadsheets, databases, desktop publishing packages, graphics packages etc. GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA This type of software tries to be a ‘jack-of-all-trades’. It provides many features that the majority of users will want e.g. formatting text, creating charts, organising tables. But it does try to be’ all things to all people’ and so there will be a vast number of features that you may never use e.g. statistical functions, mail merge. This makes the storage size of these applications fairly large. There are several good reasons for using general purpose software:  It is relatively cheap  It is easily available from most computer shops  It will have been thoroughly tested so there won’t be any serious problems or bugs  There will be lots of user support i.e. books, user guides, online help and discussion forums on the Internet Examples of General Purpose Application Software:  Desktop Publishing Software - Often used to create graphics for point of sale displays, promotional items, trade show exhibits, retail package designs and outdoor signs. In very simple words, it could be said that it is a page maker application.  Word-Processing Software - Used for the production (including composition, editing, formatting, and possibly printing) of any sort of printable material. This software enables users to create, format, edit and print electronic documents (Letters, reports, articles, …). The most popular examples of this type of software are MS Word, WordPad and Word Perfect, Libreoffice writter.  Spreadsheet Software - Used for any kind of spreadsheet work including analysis, planning or modeling. This is a general purpose software with many functions. Spreadsheet software are used for creating documents to manage and organize numerical data. It is used to perform calculations on rows and columns of data Microsoft Excel, Lotus 1-2-3 and Apple Numbers are some examples of spreadsheet  Database Database is a structured collection of data. A computer database relies on database software to organize data and enable database users to perform database operations. Database software allows users to store and retrieve data from databases. Examples are Oracle, MSAccess, EasyPhp, etc.  Graphic package Allow you to create pictures and edit photographs. Example software: CorelDraw. Paint Shop Pro.  Presentation Software: The software that is used to display information in the form of a slide show is known as presentation software. This type of software includes three functions, namely, editing that allows insertion and formatting of text, methods to include graphics in the text and a functionality of executing slide shows. Microsoft PowerPoint and Micromedia director are the best example of presentation softwareWeb design application b) Specific purpose software Function-specific software are highly specialized software that are designed to handle specific tasks. They're more limited in what they can do, but they usually perform much better than a general purpose program in a specific task. For example, TurboTax (a tax preparation package) is a special purpose application. Sure, it adds and subtracts numbers like a spreadsheet, but you can't use it to plan your monthly budget. It does only one thing - prepare tax returns. Other examples of special purpose GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA application software are web browsers, calculators, media players, calendar programs etc. Again, make sure that you don't use brand names!  Communications software: Used to send messages and emails Example software: MS Outlook Express. MS Messenger.  Desktop publishing programs: Used to combine and control graphics and text in a single document. Example software: Adobe PageMaker. MS Publisher.  Web browser: Computer program that enables internet users to access, navigate, and search World Wide Web sites. It is also called browser. Ex: Mozilla Firefox, Internet explorer, Opera, Google chrome  Enterprise Software: It deals with the needs of organization processes and data flow. Customer relationship management or the financial processes in an organization are carried out with the help of enterprise software. Ex: Sage Saari  Multimedia Software: They allow users to create and play audio and video files. They are capable of playing media files. Audio converters, audio players, burners, video encoders and decoders are some forms of multimedia software. Examples of this type of software include Real Player and Windows Media Player. c) Bespoke software Although most organisations use general purpose software, some organisations will find that it just doesn’t do exactly what they want or it doesn’t work with their current systems. In this case, they might decide to have the software system they need designed and developed specifically for them. This is called ‘tailor-made’ or ‘bespoke’ software. Bespoke application software is tailor made for a specific user and purpose. For example a factory may require software to run a robot to make cars; however, it is the only factory making that car in the world, so the software required would have to be specially built for the task. The main advantages are:  the company will get the exact software/system that they need  the software will work exactly how they want it to work  the software will only have the features that they specifically need in their business. The main disadvantages of this approach are:  it takes a long time to develop such a system, between a few months to years  it costs a great deal of money to develop such a system.  the company may need to employ a team of people such as business analysts, programmers, testers etc  there will be little in the way of user support and online help Other examples might include software for the military, missile/UAV operations, software for hospitals and medical equipment, software being written inside banks and other financial institutions. GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA II.2 Classification of software based on source Based on code source, we distinguish two types of software: Open Source Software and Closed Source Software. II.2.1 Closed source software Also called proprietary software, it is software with restricting on using, copying and modifying the source code as enforced by the proprietor. In other words, computer users do not have any access to the source code of the proprietary software. Well known examples of proprietary software include: Windows, RealPlayer, Adobe Photoshop, Mac OS, ... II.2.2 Open source software It is the type of software that has no proprietary restriction attached to it, particularly the restriction about the access to the source code. In other words, open source software is designed in such a way that computer users can freely access and modify the source code to suit their individual need. It is also called non-proprietary software. E.g. Linux, Open Office II.3 Classification of software based on licence The term licence refers to a legal document or agreement giving someone permission to do and use something. A software licence comprises the permissions, rights and restriction imposed on a piece of software. Under a software licence, the Licensee is permitted to use the licence software in compliance with a specific term on the licence. Based on licence, computer software may be divided into the following: II.3.1 Public Domain Software.GPL The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or simply GPL) is a free software license, originally written by Richard Stallman for the GNU project (a project to create a complete free software operating system). It has since become one of the most popular licenses for free software. The latest version of the license, version 2, was released in 1991. The GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), another commonly-used license, is a modified version of the GPL intended for software libraries. The GPL grants the recipients of a computer program the following rights, or "freedoms":  The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.  The freedom to study how the program works, and modify it. (Access to the source code is a precondition for this)  The freedom to redistribute copies.  The freedom to improve the program, and release the improvements to the public. (Access to the source code is a precondition for this) . II.3.2 Freeware This is a Copyrighted software given away for free by the author. Although it is available for free, the author retains the copyright, which means that you cannot do anything with it that is not expressly allowed by the author. Usually, the author allows people to use the software, but not sell it. You are also free to distribute it to anyone you want, provided the distribution is an unmodified version of what you downloaded from the provider’s web site. In fact they encourage you to distribute their Freeware. Freeware is provided on an "as is" basis and no technical support is usually available. II.3.3 Shareware GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA This may be copyrighted software, regularly in trial version, but generally the developer allows users to make copies without an initial charge. However, if the user intends to use it beyond a brief tryout, the developer requests that the program be paid for. A marketing method for software, whereby a trial version is distributed in advance and without payment. A user tries out the program, and thus shareware has also been known as 'try before you buy', demoware, trialware and by many other names. II.3.4 Crippleware The shareware version of a program whose most advanced and most desirable features have been disabled with the intention of increasing users apetite for the better version. If the fee is paid, a code is acquired, which uncripple the program. II.3.5 Nagware: Nagware (also known as annoyware) is a type of shareware, that reminds —or nags— the user to register it by paying a fee. It usually does this by popping up a message when the user starts the program or, worse, intermittently while the user is using the application. These messages can appear as windows obscuring part of the screen or message boxes that can quickly be closed. Some nagware keeps the message up for a certain time period, forcing the user to wait to continue to use the program II.3.6 Adware: Advertising-supported software is any software package which automatically plays, displays, or downloads advertising material to a computer after the software is installed on it or while the application is being used. II.3.7 Liteware This is the free version of a program, that does not contain those features that are attractive to frequent or heavy user. II.3.8 Vapoware Vaporware (or vapourware) is software or hardware which is announced by a developer well in advance of release, but which then fails to emerge, either with or without a protracted development cycle. II.4 Other type of software Custom Software: Software that is developed for a specific user or organization is custom software. Since it is built for a specific user, its specifications and features are in accordance with the user's needs. Off-the-Shelf Software: As opposed to custom software, off-the-shelf software is standard software bought off the shelf. It has predefined specifications that may or may not cater to any specific user's requirements. When you buy it, you agree to its license agreement. Tailor Made Software: Tailor made software is software that is made to the specifications of a client. In other words it is custom made, bespoke, or 'tailored' to address a specific need Retail Software: While shareware is provided as a trial version to users, retail software is sold to end users. Firmware: Firmware is a combination of software (generally, system software) permanently stored in the memory (hardware). As the name suggests, it is a program or data that has been written onto the read-only memory (ROM). For example, the BIOS (which is installed inside GBHS-BAFOUSSAM CSC-AL NOTES KOUANGA INNOCENTA a computer on a chip) checks different parts of the system before loading the operating system into the memory. Liveware: People who write programs, operate and maintain the computers are collectively known as liveware, humanware or peopleware; for example, programmers, system analysts and hardware engineers.

INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SYSTEM A computer can be viewed as a system, which consists of a number of interrelated components that work together with the aim of converting data into information. The physical parts that make up a computer (the central processing unit, input, output and storage unit) are known as hardware. Any hardware device connected to the computer or any part of the computer outside the CPU and the working memory is known as a peripheral; for example, keyboard, mouse and monitor. There are four components required for the implementation of a computerized input-process output model: 1. The computer hardware, which provides the physical mechanisms to input and output data, to manipulate and process data, and to electronically control the various input, output, and storage components. 2. The software, both application and system, which provides instructions that tell the hardware exactly what tasks are to be performed and in what order. 3. The data that is being manipulated and processed. This data may be numeric, it may be alphanumeric, it may be graphic, ... 4. The communication component, which consists of hardware and software that transport programs and data between interconnected computer systems. II. WHAT IS COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE? Computer architecture is a specification detailing how a set of software and hardware technology standards interact to form a computer system or platform. In short, computer architecture refers to how a computer system is designed and what technologies it is compatible with. There are many categories of computer architecture:  System Design: This includes all hardware components in the system, including data processors aside from the CPU, such as the graphics processing unit and direct memory access. It also includes memory controllers, data paths and miscellaneous things like multiprocessing and virtualization  Instruction Set Architecture (ISA): This is the embedded programming language of the CPU. It defines the CPU's functions and capabilities based on what programming it can perform or process. This includes the word size, processor register types, memory addressing modes, data formats and the instruction set that programmers use.  Microarchitecture: Otherwise known as computer organization, this type of architecture defines the data paths, data processing and storage elements, as well as how they should be implemented in the ISA. Computer Architecture = Instruction Set Architecture + Computer Organization. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is what the computer does (logical view) and Computer Organization is how the ISA is implemented (physical view). III. ABSTRACTION LAYERS OF A COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE A hardware abstraction layer (HAL) is a logical division of code that serves as an abstraction layer between a computer's physical hardware and its software. It provides a device driver interface allowing a program to communicate with the hardware. The main purpose of a HAL is to conceal different hardware architectures from the OS by providing a uniform interface to the system peripherals. A PC may include the HAL in the OS kernel or in the form of device drivers that provide a consistent interface for applications to interact with the hardware peripherals. IV. THE VON NEUMANN ARCHITECTURE A very good example of computer architecture is Von Neumann architecture, which is still used by most types of computers today. This was proposed by the mathematician John Von Neumann in 1945. This architecture is comprised of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Memory, Input/Output, and a control unit. Fig : Schematic diagram of von Neumann architecture In von Neumann’s model, a computer has 3 subsystems (i) a CPU, (ii) a main memory, and (iii) an I/O system. The main memory holds the program as well as data and the computer is allowed to manipulate its own program. In the von-Neumann model, instructions are executed sequentially (one at a time). In the von-Neumann model a single path exists between the control until and main memory, this leads to the so-called "von Neumann bottleneck" since memory fetches are the slowest part of an instruction they become the bottleneck in any computation.  HARVARD ARCHITECTURE The Harvard architecture is a computer architecture with separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data. It contrasts with the von Neumann architecture, where program instructions and data share the same memory and pathways. IV.1 Central Processing Unit IV.1.1 Understanding what CPU is a) Definition The central processing unit, also known as processor, is the brain of the computer system that processes data (input) and converts it into meaningful information (output). It is referred to as the administrative section of the computer system that interprets the data and instructions, coordinates the operations and supervises the instructions. The CPU consists of three main subsystems: the arithmetic/logic unit (ALU), the control unit (CU) and the registers. These three subsystems work together to provide operational capabilities to the computer. Fig: The CPU architecture Central Processing Unit (CPU) General Registers R0 R1 R2 ALU Output Register R3 Input Register 1 Input Register 2 Instruction Decoder Program Counter Instruction Register Internal Bus Control Unit b) Characteristics of the CPU Memory Addr. $ Address Bus Data Bus Control Bus Read/Write 000 001 002 3FD 3FE $ 3FF The common characteristics of a CPU can affect it in many different ways to help your computer: A microprocessor can be characterized by:  Instruction Set: It is the set of instructions that the microprocessor executes  Number of cores: The core fetches and decodes instructions. So if you add more than one it will increase the speed of performance of the computer system.  Cache size: Therefore, having a larger cache size on the CPU can improve the performance of the computer.  The clock speed: The System Clock is an electronic circuit that generates pulses. The number of pulses generated by the clock per unit of time is its Clock speed., faster is the CPU. The speed of the CPU is measured in MEGAHERTZ (MHZ), which corresponds to the millions of cycles per second (1 MHz = 1 million of cycle per second = number of instructions per second). c) Examples of CPU The most commonly used CPU in PCs are made by Intel. Since IBM chose the Intel 8088 chip for the original IBM PC, most PC clones have used one of the Intel series of CPUs: → 8088 - used in IBM PC → 80286 - used in IBM PC AT → 80386 - used in first PC clone from Compaq → 80486 - you heard phrases like “I have a 486 PC” → Pentium I, Pentium II, Pentium III, Pentium IV - Most desktop PCs in 2004 used the P4 chip. → dual core, core i3, i5, i7… d) Types of Processor According To Flynn's Taxonomy  SISD: (single instruction stream, single data stream) Conventional computer architecture with 1 processor; instructions are done sequentially. Your PC or Macintosh is of this type.  SIMD: (single instruction stream, multiple data stream) A single instruction processing unit, called a controller, and several data processing unit. It means that all parallel units share the same instruction, but they carry it out on different data elements. The Thinking Machines CM-1 and MassPar MP-1 were examples of such architecture.  MISD: (multiple instruction streams, single data stream) This category in which various computing elements work on a single data has never lead to a successful computer.  MIMD: (multiple instruction streams, multiple data stream) This is the widest and most successful category of parallel computers. It means parallel units have separate instructions, so each of them can do something different at any given time; one may be adding, another multiplying, yet another evaluating a branch condition, and so on. Nowadays, DEll, IBM, and HP servers are of this type. e) Types of Processor According to instructions set Processors differ from one another by their instruction sets. If the same program can run on two different processors, they are said to be compatible. For example, programs written for IBM computers may not run on Apple computers because these two architectures (different processors) are not compatible. Based upon the instruction sets, there are two common types of architectures: complex instruction set computer (CISC) and reduced instruction set computer (RISC).  CISC Architecture To make compiler development easier, complex instruction set computer (CISC) was developed. The sole motive of manufacturers of CISC-based processor was to manufacture processors with more extensive and complex instruction set. It shifted most of the burden of generating machine instructions to the processor. For example, instead of making a compiler to write long machine instructions for calculating a square root, a CISC processor would incorporate a hardwired circuitry for performing the square root in a single step. Writing instructions for a CISC processor is comparatively easy because a single instruction is sufficient to utilize the built-in ability. Most of the PCs today include a CISC processor.  RISC Architecture Reduced instruction set computer (RISC) is a processor architecture that utilizes a small, highly optimized set of instructions. The concept behind RISC architecture is that a small number of instructions are faster in execution as compared to a single long instruction. To implement this, RISC architecture simplifies the instruction set of the processor, which helps in reducing the execution time. Optimization of each instruction in the processor is done through a technique known as pipelining.  Comparing CISC and RISC Architectures Basic CISC RISC Instruction Set Complex instructions Program Code Size Simple instructions Smaller Lengthier Processor Size Increased hardwired circuitry leads to increased processor size Reduced hardwired circuitry leads to reduced processor size Memory Usage Less memory intensive Power Consumption More memory intensive More power Less power Heating More heat Fixed length instructions Less heat Variable length instructions IV.1.2 Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): This unit performs the arithmetic (add and subtract) and logical operations (and, or) on the available data. The ALU comprises two units: an arithmetic unit and a logic unit.  Arithmetic Unit: The arithmetic unit contains the circuitry that is responsible for performing the actual computing and carrying out the arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It can perform these operations at a very high speed.  Logic Unit: The logic unit enables the CPU to make logical operations based on the instructions provided. The logic unit can compare numbers, letters or special characters and can then take action based on the result of the comparison. IV.1.3 Control Unit: The control unit can be thought of as the heart of the CPU. It is made up of the following:  PC (Program Counter): stores the address of next instruction to fetch  IR (Instruction Register): stores the instruction fetched from memory  Instruction Decoder: Decodes instruction and activates necessary circuitry The figure below illustrates how  Control unit instructs the other parts of the CPU (i.e. ALU and registers) and the I/O devices on what to do and when to do. In addition,  It determines what data are needed, where they are stored and where to store the results of the operation as well as sends the control signals to the devices involved in the execution of the instructions. Figure : The control unit IV.1.3 Registers: These are the special-purpose, high-speed temporary memory units that hold the information that the CPU is currently working on. There are various types of registers present inside a CPU. The most basic and essential registers for any CPU are.  The Program Counter (PC) is a special register that holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched from Memory . The PC is incremented to ("point to") the next instruction while an instruction is being fetched from main memory.  The Instruction Register (IR) is a special register that holds each instruction after it is fetched from main memory.  The General Registers R0, R1, R2, R3 are available for the programmer to use in his/her programs. Typically the programmer tries to maximise the use of these registers in order to speed program execution.  Accumulator (ACC): An accumulator is a general-purpose register used for storing temporary results and results produced by arithmetic logic unit.  Memory Address Register (MAR): The MAR register is used to store the address of the location in memory that is to be accessed for reading or writing.  Memory Buffer Register (MBR): A memory buffer register is used for storing data either coming to the CPU or data being transferred by the CPU.  Memory Data Register (MDR): A data register is used for storing the operands and other data. The size or length of each register is determined by its function. For example, the memory address register, which holds the address of the next location in memory to be accessed, must have the same number of bits as the memory address. Instruction register holds the next instruction to be executed and, therefore, should be of the same number of bits as the instruction. (NB: The number and sizes of registers vary from processor to processor.) IV.2 Main Memory Unit Logically, main memory is an integral component of the CPU, but physically it is a separate part placed on the computer's motherboard. It stores program instructions or data for only as long as the program they pertain to is in operation. The primary memory is of two types: random access memory (RAM) and read only memory (ROM). Main memory can be considered to be organised as a matrix of bits. Each row represents a memory location, typically this is equal to the word size of the architecture, although it can be a word multiple (e.g. 2xWordsize) or a partial word (e.g. half the wordsize). Each row also has a natural number called its address which is used for selecting the row: • Memory width (W): How many bits is each memory cell • Address width (N): How many bits used to represent each address, determines the maximum memory size = address space. If address width is N-bits, then address space is 2N (0,1,...,2N-1) IV.2.1 Random Access Memory Random access memory (RAM) directly provides the required information to the processor. It is used to hold both program code (instructions) and data (numbers, strings etc) on which the computer is working. It is volatile in nature, which means the information stored in it remains only as long as the power is switched ON. Computer architectures also impose an architectural constraint on the maximum allowable RAM. This constraint is normally equal to 2Word Size memory locations. Although slower than register memory, the contents of any location in RAM can still be “read” or “written” very quickly. The time to read or write is referred to as the access time and is constant for all RAM locations. RAM can be further classified into two categories:  SRAM (Static RAM) is the fastest form of RAM but also the most expensive. Due to its cost it is not used as main memory but rather for cache memory. Each bit requires a 6-transistor circuit.  DRAM (Dynamic RAM) is not as fast as SRAM but is cheaper and is used for main memory. Each bit uses a single capacitor and single transistor circuit. Since capacitors lose their charge, DRAM needs to be refreshed every few milliseconds. The memory system does this transparently. There are many implementations of DRAM, two well-known ones are SDRAM and DDR SDRAM.  SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM) is a form of DRAM that is synchronised with the clock of the CPU’s system bus, sometimes called the front-side bus (FSB). As an example, if the system bus operates at 167Mhz over an 8-byte (64-bit) data bus , then an SDRAM module could transfer 167 x 8 ~ 1.3GB/sec.  DDR SDRAM (Double-Data Rate DRAM) is an optimisation of SDRAM that allows data to be transferred on both the rising edge and falling edge of a clock signal. Effectively doubling the amount of data that can be transferred in a period of time. For example a PC-3200 DDR-SDRAM module operating at 200Mhz can transfer 200 x 8 x 2 ~ 3.2GB/sec over an 8-byte (64-bit) data bus. IV.2.2 Read-only Memory ROM (Read Only Memory) is like RAM except that its contents cannot be overwritten and are not lost if power is turned off (ROM is non-volatile). The ROM stores the initial start-up instructions and routines in the BIOS (basic input/output system). The instructions in the ROM are built into the electronic circuits of the chip, which is called firmware. The ROM is also random access in nature. Various types of ROM, namely,  PROM (Programmable ROM) is like ROM but allows end-users to write their own programs and data. It requires a special PROM writing equipment. Note: users can only write-once to PROM.  EPROM (Erasable PROM). With EPROM we can erase (using strong ultra-violet light) the contents of the chip and rewrite it with new contents, typically several thousand times.  EEPROM (Electrically Erasable PROM). As the name implies the contents of EEPROMs are erased electrically.  FLASH memory is a cheaper form of EEPROM where updates (erase-writes) can only be performed on blocks of memory, not on individual bytes. The number of erase/write cycles to a block is typically several hundred thousand before the block can no longer be written. IV.3 Interconnection of Units Now, let us discuss the interconnection between the CPU (CU, ALU and registers), the memory unit, and the I/O devices, which constitute the entire computer system. IV.3.1 System Bus The Bus is the functional units are interconnected to enable data transport (e.g. write CPU register data content to a certain address in memory). It is a set of connections between two or more components/devices, which is designed to transfer several/all bits of a word from source to destination. A bus can be unidirectional (transmission of data can be only in one direction) or bidirectional (transmission of data can be in both directions). A bus that connects to all the three components (CPU, memory and I/O devices) is called a system bus. Fig: System bus a) Data bus: Data lines provide a path for moving data between the system modules. These are collectively known as data bus. Normally, a data bus consists of 8, 16 or 32 separate lines. The number of lines present in a data bus is called the width of data bus. Data bus width limits the maximum number of bits, which can be transferred simultaneously between two modules. Unlike the address bus, the data bus is bi-directional (it supports read and write operations). The data bus is not limited to transferring data; it is also used to transfer program instructions. b) Address bus: is used to specify a physical memory address. This can include primary memory (e.g. RAM and ROM) secondary memory (e.g. hard disk drives) and any other connected devices. Monitors, printers, scanners, and keyboards will all be mapped to memory. The width of the address bus determines the amount of memory that can be addressed. A 32 bit bus can address 4,294,967,296 (2 ^ 32) bytes of memory. This explains the 4 GB memory restriction on 32-bit operating systems. c) Control bus: Control bus carries commands from and returns status signals to the microprocessor. These lines are used for the transmission of commands and timing signals (which validate data and address) between the system modules. IV.3.2 Cache A cache is a piece of very fast memory, made from high-speed static RAM that reduces the time of accessing data. It is very expensive and generally incorporated in the processor, where valuable data and program segments are kept. Major reason for incorporating cache in the system is that the CPU is much faster than the DRAM and needs a place to store information that can be accessed rapidly. The cache facilitates the system to catch up with the processor's speed. The cache fetches the frequently used data from the DRAM and buffers (stores) it for further processor usage. Cache can be further categorized into three levels i. Level 1 Cache (L1): Level 1 cache, also known as primary cache, is built into the processor chip. It is a small fast memory area that works together with the Level 2 cache to provide the processor much faster access to important and often used data. ii. Level 2 Cache (L2): Level 2 cache, also known as secondary cache, is a collection of static RAM chips that are built onto the motherboard. It is little larger and slower than L1, but is faster than the main memory. L1 and L2 cache are used together for optimal use of the processor. iii. Level 3 Cache (L3): L3 cache memory is an enhanced form of memory present on the motherboard of the computer. It is an extra cache built into the motherboard between the processor and the main memory to speed up the processing operations Fig : L1, L2 and L3 caches V. THE INSTRUCTION SET ARCHITECTURE An instruction set or computer set architecture (ISA) is a collection of all possible machine language commands that are understood and can be executed by a processor. It is the part of the computer architecture related to programming, including the native data types, instructions, registers, addressing modes, memory architecture, interrupt and exception handling, and external I/O. V.1 Types if instruction a) Data Movement Instructions: These are used to transfer or copy data from one location to another either in the registers or in the external main memory. e.g. 8086 LOAD, STORE, MOVE b) Arithmetic Instructions: These instructions are used to perform operations on numerical data. (e.g ADD, SUB, SHIFT, ) c) Logical Instructions: These are used to perform Boolean operations on non-numerical data. (e.g. 8086 CMP, AND, OR, XOR instructions) d) Program Control Instructions: These are used to change the sequence of a program execution. E.g. CALL, RETURN, HALT Stop program execution e) Branch: JZ, JNZ, JUMP X f) Load next instruction from memory loc. X Input–output Instructions: These are used to transfer data from and to I/O devices. V.2 Instruction format Each machine language instruction is composed of two parts: the op-code and the operand. The figure below illustrates the format of an instruction used by many processor. The first three bits represent the op-code and the final six bits represent the operand. The middle bit represents whether the operand is a memory address or a number. When the bit is set to 1, the operand represents a number. Figure . An Instruction Format Architectures are differentiated from one another by the number of bits allowed per instruction (16, 32, and 64 are the most common), by the number of operands allowed per instruction, and by the types of instructions and data each can process. More specifically, instruction sets are differentiated by the following features:  Operand storage in the CPU (data can be stored in a stack structure or in registers)  Number of explicit operands per instruction (zero, one, two, and three being the most common)  Operand location (instructions can be classified as register-to-register, register-to memory or memory-to-memory, which simply refer to the combinations of operands allowed per instruction)  Operations (including not only types of operations but also which instructions can access memory and which cannot)  Type and size of operands (operands can be addresses, numbers, or even characters) There exist various types of instruction formats. The most common are: 0-address instruction, 1 address instruction, 2-address instruction and 3-address instruction 1) 0-address instruction (stack architecture) It is used in a stack architecture. A 0-address instruction uses a stack to hold both the operands and the result. Operations are performed on the operands stored on the top of the stack and the second value on the stack. The result is stored on the top of the stack. Just like the use of an accumulator register, the addresses of the stack registers need not be specified, their usage is implicit. Therefore, only one field is required in 0-address instruction; it specifies the op-code. Example: add tos ← tos + next 2) 1-address instruction (accumulator architecture) A 1-address instruction has a dedicated CPU register, called the accumulator, to hold one operand and to store the result. There is no need of encoding the address of the accumulator register to access the operand or to store the result, as its usage is implicit. Example: add A acc ← acc + mem[A] 3) 2-address instruction (Register (register-memory)) A 2-address instruction has three fields; one for the op-code, the second field specifies the address of one of the source operands as well as the destination operand, and the last field is used for holding the address of the second source operand. So one of the fields serves two purposes; specifying a source operand address and a destination operand address. It is a memory – memory instruction or a register – memory instruction. Example: add A, B add R1, A load R1, A mem[A] ← mem[A] + mem[B] R1 ← R1 + mem[A] R1 ← mem[A] 4) 3-address instruction (Register (load-store)) A 3-address instruction specifies the addresses of two operands and the address of the destination operand. It is a memory – memory instruction or register – register instruction Example: add A, B, C mem[A] ← mem[B] + mem[C] add R1, R2, R3 R1 ← R2 + R3 load R1, R2 R1 ← mem[R2] store R1, R2 Example1 : Code Sequence C = A + B mem[R1] ← R2 Stack Accumulator Register (register-memory) Register (load-store) Push A Push B Add Pop C Load A Add B Store C Load R1, A Add R1, B Store C, R1 Load R1,A Load R2, B Add R3, R1, R2 Store C, R3 Example 2: X=A * B + C * C Instruction Comments 0-address instruction PUSH A PUSH B MULTIPLY PUSH C PUSH C MULTIPLY ADD POP X Transfer A to top of stack Transfer B to top of stack Remove A, B from stack and replace by A x B Transfer C to top of stack Transfer second copy of C to top of stack Remove C, C from stack and replace by C x C Remove C x C, AxB from stack, replace by their sum Transfer result from top of stack to X 1-address instruction LOAD A MULTIPLY B STORE T LOAD C MULTIPLY C ADD T STORE X Transfer A to accumulator AC AC ← AC * B Transfer AC to memory location T Transfer C to accumulator AC AC ← AC * C AC ← AC + T Transfer result to memory location X 2-address instruction MOVE A, T MULTIPLY B, T MOVEC, X MULTIPLY C, X ADD T, X T ← A T ← T * B X ← C X ← X * C X ← X + T 3-address instruction MULTIPLY A, B, T MULTIPLY C, C, X ADDX, T, X T ← A x B X ← C x C X ← X + T V.1 The Instruction Cycle An instruction cycle (sometimes called fetch decode-execute cycle, or FDX) is the basic operation cycle of a computer. It is the process by which a computer retrieves a program instruction from its memory, determines what actions the instruction requires, and carries out those actions. A simple instruction cycle consists of the following steps: Fetch: obtaining a program instruction or data item from the memory. Decode: translating the instruction into commands the computer can execute. Execute : carrying out the commands How does this all work together? Program Execution: – PC is set to the address where the first program instruction is stored in memory. – Repeat Fetch instruction Decode instruction Execute instruction until HALT instruction or fatal error V.1.1 The Fetch Cycle During this cycle, the instruction, which is to be executed next, is fetched from the memory to the processor. The steps performed during the fetch cycle are as follows: 1. PC --> MAR: This address is transferred from PC to MAR. 2. Fetch signal: The instruction is read from the memory. 3. PC + 1 --> PC: Then, the PC is incremented by 1 (PC = PC + 1) and instruction so obtained is transferred to the IR. 4. In the IR, the unique bit patterns that make up machine language are extracted and sent to the decoder. V.1.2 The Decode Cycle The decode cycle is responsible for recognizing the operation that the bit pattern represents and activating the correct circuitry to perform that operation. The steps performed during the decode cycle are as follows: 1. The operation code (op-code) of the instruction is first read, and then interpreted in the machine language. 2. The data required by the instruction (operand) are then transferred to the data register (DR). V.1.3 The Execute Cycle Once the instruction has been decoded, the operation specified by the op-code is performed on user-provided data in ALU. The execution cycle involves following steps: 1. The data is fetched into ALU from the memory location pointed by memory address register. 2. The operation specified by the decoded op-code is performed on the data in ALU. V.2 Fixed and Variable length Instructions Instructions are translated to machine code. In some architecture all machine code instructions are the same length i.e. fixed length. In other architectures, different instructions may be translated into variable lengths in machine code. This is the situation with 8086 instructions which range from one byte to a maximum of 6 bytes in length. Such instructions are called variable length instructions and are commonly used on CISC machines. The advantage of using such instructions, is that each instruction can use exactly the amount of space it requires, so that variable length instructions reduce the amount of memory space required for a program. On the other hand, it is possible to have fixed length instructions, whereas the name suggests, each instruction has the same length. Fixed length instructions are commonly used with RISC processors such as the PowerPC and Alpha processors. Since each instruction occupies the same amount of space, every instruction must be long enough to specify a memory operand, even if the instruction does not use one. Hence, memory space is wasted by this form of instruction. VI. ADDRESSING MODES Addressing is simply how we give an instruction its operands. There are two types of addressing: non memory addressing and memory addressing.  Non memory addressing is the simplest form of addressing because it either takes predefined data or a register name. Non memory addressing is also guaranteed to be the fastest way to address operands. Memory addressing allows us to access data in memory.  Memory addressing modes can be as fast as non memory addressing modes, but only if the memory being accessed exists in a cache that is on the CPU chip. If the memory does not exist in any cache it will be directly read from or written to RAM which can take several cycles. The processor will stall the instruction in order to wait for a memory read or a memory write to be completed. There exist various addressing modes: Immediate, Direct, Indirect, Register, Register Indirect, Displacement (Indexed) VI.1 Immediate Addressing In this type of addressing, the data is part of the instruction. The operand's value is specified at compile time. This operand is usually a numeric value. e.g. ADD 5 Add 5 to contents of accumulator VI.2 Direct Addressing In direct memory addressing, the address of the data is given in the instruction. Address field contains address of operand. Effective address (EA) = address field (A) e.g. ADD A Add contents of cell A to accumulator VI.3 Indirect Addressing This addressing mode utilizes the computer's ability of Segment:Offset addressing. Indirect Addressing gives the address of the address of the data in the instruction. It is generally used for variables containing several elements like, arrays. Memory cell pointed to by address field contains the address of (pointer to) the operand EA = (A) Look in A, find address (A) and look there for operand e.g. ADD (A) Add contents of cell pointed to by contents of A to accumulator VI.4 Register Addressing The register addressing mode is used to move data to and from registers and to manipulate the data in a register. The data may be a numeric value, memory address, or general data. This addressing mode is one of the most common and is almost always used in conjunction with memory addressing modes. N.B. in C programming register int a; VI.5 Relative Addressing Relative addressing is a version of displacement addressing. Here, EA = A + (PC) i.e. get operand from A cells from current location pointed to by PC VI.6 Indexed Addressing Index addressing uses a register (implicitly or explicitly) as an offset or a displacement, which is added to the address in the operand to determine the effective address of the data. This mode is extremely useful when accessing elements of an array when the element size is 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes big. However, if the element size is not one of the scale sizes than you have to manually adjust the index according to the element size. EA = (A) + (R) Example: These are the values loaded into the accumulator for each addressing mode. VII. INTERRUPT AND POOLING VII.1 What is an Interrupt? An interrupt is an event external to the currently executing process that causes a change in the normal flow of instruction execution; usually generated by hardware devices Hardware interrupts are used by devices to communicate that they require attention from the operating system. A software-generated interrupt caused either by an error, or by a specific request from a user program is called trap. In most computer systems, interrupts are handled as quickly as possible. When an interrupt is received, any current activity is stopped and an interrupt handler (interrupt controller) is executed. There exist two type of interrupt: maskable and non-maskable interrupts An interrupt is said to be masked when it has been disabled, or when the CPU has been instructed to ignore it. A non-maskable interrupt (NMI) cannot be ignored, and is generally used only for critical hardware errors. Fig: maskable and non maskable interupt VII.2 Polling Polling, or polled operation, refers to actively sampling the status of an external device by a client program as a synchronous activity. . Polling has the disadvantage that if there are too many devices to check, the time required to poll them can exceed the time available to service the I/O device. VIII. OTHER TYPES OF ARCHITECHTURE VIII.1 The system bus model. Bus-based computers are structured like that - processors and memory are connected to a backbone bus that acts as a "superhighway" for data or instructions to move between processors and memory. In practice, the bus architecture has the same components as the von Neumann architecture, but they are arranged along a bus, as shown in Figure 2. Fig. Schematic diagram of a system bus architecture In principle, the bus computer solves the von Neumann bottleneck problem by using a fast bus. In practice, the bus is rarely fast enough to support I/O for the common case (90 percent of practical applications), and bus throughput can be significantly reduced under large amounts of data. VIII.2 Multiprocessor or Parallel Architecture. Recall the old saying, "Many hands make less work." In computers, the use of many processors together reduces the amount of time required to perform the work of solving a given problem. Fig .Schematic diagram of multiprocessor architecture This is a simple architecture that is useful for solving selected types of compute-intensive problems. However, if you try to solve data-intensive problems on such an architecture, you encounter the von Neumann bottleneck trying to read and write the large amount of data from and to the shared memory. To help solve the problem of bus contention inherent in shared-memory multiprocessors, computer scientists developed the mixed model of parallel processing, in which the CPUs have small, very fast local memories that communicate with the CPU via a very fast, short bus. Local memory architectures are useful for problems that have data locality, where each CPU can solve part of a problem with part of the problem's data, and there is little need for data interchange between processors. Fig. Schematic diagram of multiprocessor architecture with shared memory, where each CPU also has its own fast, local memory IX. MODERN MICROPROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE IX.1 Pipelining & Instruction-Level Parallelism Consider how an instruction is executed – first it is fetched, then decoded, then executed by the appropriate functional unit, and finally the result is written into place. With this scheme, a simple processor might take 4 cycles per instruction (CPI = 4)... Figure 15 – The instruction flow of a sequential processor. Modern processors overlap these stages in a pipeline, like an assembly line. While one instruction is executing, the next instruction is being decoded, and the one after that is being fetched... Pipelining is an implementation technique where multiple instructions are overlapped in execution. Figure 16 – The instruction flow of a pipelined processor Now the processor is completing 1 instruction every cycle (CPI = 1). This is a four-fold speedup without changing the clock speed at all. The pipeline designer’s goal is to balance the length of each pipeline stage. If the stages are perfectly balanced, then the time per instruction on the pipelined machine is equal to � �𝒊𝒎𝒆 𝒑𝒆𝒓 𝒊𝒏𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝒐𝒏 𝒖𝒏𝒑𝒊𝒑𝒆𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒅 𝒎𝒂𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒆 𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒑𝒊𝒑𝒆 𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒈𝒆𝒔 IX.1.3 Multiple Issue – Superscalar A superscalar CPU architecture implements a form of parallelism called instruction level parallelism within a single processor. It therefore allows faster CPU throughput than would otherwise be possible at a given clock rate. Figure 8 – The instruction flow of a superscalar processor. IX.3 Parallel vs. Distributed Processing With single-CPU computers, it is possible to perform parallel processing by connecting the computers in a network. However, this type of parallel processing requires very sophisticated software called distributed processing software. Note that parallel processing differs from multitasking, in which a single CPU executes several programs at once. Parallel processing is also called parallel computing. IX.4 Examples of modern processor Intel has been making class leading processors for computers for a long time now. They overcame a period where AMD reigned as king by releasing their line of Core 2 processors in 2006. Now Intel has a new line of processors called the Core I series. The i3, the i5 and the i7 are the new kids on the block. CORE i3 is a basic level processor type of the new generation launched by Intel All Core i3s are dual-core processors. They have a Clock speeds ranging from 2.93 to 3.06 GHz. They possess 3MB of cache. CORE i5-They have 2 categories. Dual core and Quad core. Let’s talk about both of them in a nutshell. – i5-Dual core has a 32 nm fabrication? 4 MB cache is present in i5. The range of their clock speeds is between 3.2 to 3.6 GHz for Dual cores. – i5–Quad Core. Quad cores clock speeds of 2.4 and 2.66 GHz. Turbo Boost technology Supported, don’t support Hyperthreading and don’t have a Integrated Graphics Processor. They have 6MB - 8MB of cache CORE i7-High end processor. They are also the fastest and the most expensive in the lot. Total 4 Cores are present as they are quad core. The range of clock speeds is 1.06 GHz to 3.20 GHz, 8MB of cache is given. The IGP [Integrated Graphics] on Core i7 processors can also reach a higher maximum clock speed of 1350 MHz NUMBER SYSTEM Contents I.

DEFINITIONS A number system defines a set of values that is used to represent quantity. It is characterize by the base or radix. The base tells the number of symbols used in the system. Then the system of base n will use digits from 0 to n-1. E.g. Base 3 uses the digits 0, 1 and 2. Base 6 uses the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. The base of a number system is indicated by a subscript (decimal number) and this will be followed by the value of the number. The following are few examples:  (7592)10 is of base 10 number system.  (214)8 is of base 8 number system.  (123)16 is of base 16 number system II. TYPES OF NUMBER SYSTEM Eventually, the number systems that are generally used by the computers are as follows: • Decimal number system • Binary number system • Octal number system • Hexadecimal number system Number System Radix Value Set of Digits Example Decimal r = 10 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (25)10 Binary r = 2 0, 1 (11001)2 Octal r = 8 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (31)8 Hexadecimal r = 16 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F (19)16 Table 1. Types of Number Systems Factorisation. Let consider the number N of n digits in base b written as follow: (𝑫𝒏−1…𝑫2𝑫1𝑫0)𝒃. N can be also written 𝑵=𝑫𝒏−1𝒃𝒏−1+⋯+𝑫𝒊𝒃𝒊+⋯+𝑫2𝒃2+𝑫1𝒃1+𝑫0=∑ 𝑫𝒊𝒃𝒊 𝒏−1 0 Example.

CONVERSION BETWEEN NUMBER BASES F We have discussed earlier that internally the computer uses binary numbers for data representation, whereas externally it uses decimal numbers. However, any number in one number system can be represented in any other number system. Conversion between number systems can be classified into three types: Coding, decoding and encoding. III.1. Coding Coding is the conversion from decimal base (base 10) to any non-decimal base b ( 𝑏 ≠ 10). IV.1.1 Coding of whole numbers III.1.2 Conversion of Decimal Fractions Examples: a) Determine the binary equivalent of (0.375)10. 0.375 x 2 = 0.750 0 0.75 x 2 = 1.50 1 0.5 x 2 = 1.0 1 Finally, (0.375)10 = (0.011)2 b) Determine hexadecimal conversion of (671.175)10 We have already noticed in the previous question that (671)10 = (29F)16. Now let convert (0.175)10 in base 16 0.175 x 16 = 2.8 2 0.8 x 16 = 12.8 C 0.8 x 16 = 12.8 C .... Finally, (671.175)10 = (29F.2CCC...)16 III. 2. Decoding To decode is convert from a non-decimal base b (𝑏 ≠ 10) to the decimal base (base 10). III.2.1 Conversion of whole numbers In this case, each digit of the binary number is multiplied by its weighted position, and each of the weighted values is added together to get the decimal number. Examples: a) Convert 2358 into base 10. The Process: Above each of the digits in your number, list the power of the base that the digit represents. See the example on the left. It is now a simple process of multiplication and addition to determine your base 10 number. In this example you have 5 x 80 = 5 3 x 81 = 24 2 x 82 = 128 Now simply add these values together. 5 + 24 + 128 = 157 Answer: 2358 = 15710 **Remember: any number to the zero power equals one. b) Convert 10112 to base 10. 1 x 20 = 1 1 x 21 = 2 0 x 22 = 0 1 x 23 = 8 c) Convert 1C416 to base 10. 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 11 Answer: 10112 = 1110 4 x 160 = 4 C x 161 = 12 x 161 = 192 1 x 162 = 256 4 + 192 + 256 = 452 Answer: 1C416 = 45210 III.2.2 Conversion of non-decimal fractions to decimal fraction Examples: a) Determine the decimal equivalent of (0.01101)2. Thus, the decimal equivalent of (0.01101)2 is (0.40625)10. b) Determine the decimal equivalent of (237.04)8. Sum of weight of all bits = 128 + 24 + 7 + 0 + 0.0625 = 159.0625 Thus, the decimal equivalent of (237.04)8 is (159.0625)10. c) Determine the decimal equivalent of (45C.8BE3)16. Sum of weight of all bits = 1024 + 80 + 12 +0.5 + .0429687 + .0034179 + .0000457= 1116.5464323 Thus, the decimal equivalent of (45C.8BE3)16 is (1116.5464323)10. III.3. Encoding Encoding is the conversion from a non-decimal base to a non-decimal base. Some special cases would be distinguished. III.3.1 Conversion of Binary to Hexadecimal Examples: a) Determine the hexadecimal equivalent of (101011110011011001)2 The hexadecimal equivalent of (101011110011011001)2 is (2BCD9)16. b) Determine the hexadecimal equivalent of (1100001.101011110011)2. The hexadecimal equivalent of (1100001.101011110011)2 is (61.AF3)16. III.3.2 Conversion of Hexadecimal to Binary Examples: a) Determine the binary equivalent of (5AF)16. Combining the four bits of the binary-coded values, we have 010110101111. Thus, the binary equivalent of (5AF)16 is (010110101111)2. b) Determine the binary equivalent of (2B.6C)16. Combining the four bits of the binary-coded values, we have 00101011.01101100. Thus, the binary equivalent of (2B.6C)16 is (00101011.01101100)2. III.3.3 Conversion of Octal to Hexadecimal Examples: a) Determine the hexadecimal equivalent of (2327)8. Combining the three-bit binary blocks, we have 010011010111. Dividing the group of binary numbers into the four-bit binary blocks and by converting these blocks into their respective hexadecimal symbols, we have: Thus, the hexadecimal equivalent of (2327)8 is (4D7)16. b) Determine the hexadecimal equivalent of (31.57)8. Combining the three-bit binary blocks, we have 011001.101111. Dividing the group of binary numbers into the four-bit binary blocks and by converting these blocks into their respective hexadecimal symbols, we have: Thus, the hexadecimal equivalent of (31.57)8 is (19.BC)16. III.3.4 Conversion of Hexadecimal to Octal Examples: a) Determine the octal equivalent of (5DE247)16. Combining all the four-bit binary blocks, we have 010111011110001001000111. Dividing the group of binary numbers into the three-bit binary blocks and by converting these blocks into their respective octal symbols, we have: Thus, the octal equivalent of (5DE247)16 is (27361107)8. b) Determine the octal equivalent of (7B.64D)16. Combining all the four-bit binary blocks, we have 01111011.011001001101. Dividing the group of binary numbers into the three-bit binary blocks and by converting these blocks into their respective octal symbols, we have: Thus, the hexadecimal equivalent of (7B.64D)16 is (173.3115)8 IV. BINARY ARITHMETIC The arithmetic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, performed on the binary numbers is called binary arithmetic IV.1 Binary addition  0 + 0 = 0  0 + 1 = 1  1 + 0 = 1  1 + 1 = 0, and carry 1 to the next more significant bit Examples, a) 00011010 + 00001100 = 00100110 1 1 carries 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 = (26)10 +0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 = (12)10 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 = (38)10 b) 00010011 + 00111110 = 01010001 1 1 1 1 1 carries IV.2 Binary Subtraction 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 = (19)10 +0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 = (62)10 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 = (81)10 Rules of Binary Subtraction 0 ‐ 0 = 0 0 ‐ 1 = 1, and borrow 1 from the next more significant bit 1 ‐ 0 = 1 1 ‐ 1 = 0 Examples, a) 00100101 ‐ 00010001 = 00010100 1 borrows 00100101 = (37)10 ‐ 00010001 = (17)10 00010100 = (20)10 b) 00110011 ‐ 00010110 = 00011101 11 borrows 00110011 = (51)10 ‐ 00010110 = (22)10 00011101 = (29)10 IV.3 Binary Multiplication The multiplication process for binary numbers is similar to that for decimal numbers. Partial products are formed, with each product shifted one place to the left. This is illustrated below. Rules of Binary Multiplication Example, a) 111 x 101 b) 101001 × 110 = 11110110 101001 = (41)10 × 110 = (6)10 000000 101001 101001 11110110 = (246)10 IV.4 Binary division Binary division follows a similar process to that of decimal division. Example: Divide (a) (15)10by (5)10 in binary form, and (b) (15)10 by (6)10 in binary form. V. REPRESENTATION OF NEGATIVE BINARY NUMBER Usually a given computer uses a fixed number of bits for storing integers. So we use terms such as 8 bits integer, 16-bits integers, ... Whatever the principle remains the same, the only difference is that with more bits, we can store wider range of number. In general, with n bits, one can store 2n numbers. V.1 Signed magnitude representation In the sign magnitude representation, the sign of a binary number has to be represented using 0 and 1, in the computer. An n-bit signed binary number consists of two parts – sign bit and magnitude. The left most bit, also called the Most Significant Bit (MSB) is the sign bit. The remaining n-1 bits denote the magnitude of the number. For example, 01100011 is a positive number since its sign bit is 0, and, 11001011 is a negative number since its sign bit is 1. An 8-bit signed number can represent data in the range -128 to +127 (-27 to +27-1). In general, using n bits, the range of integer we can store using two’s complement is -2n-1 to 2n-1 V.2 Complements The complement of a number is the number, which when added to the original will make it equal to a multiple of the base number system. For every base r system, there are two types of complements: rs complement and (r – 1)s complement.  For decimal r = 10, we have 9s and 10s complement.  For binary r = 2, we have 1s and 2s complement.  For octal r = 8, we have 7s and 8s complement.  For hexadecimal r = 16, we have 15s and 16s complement. There are two types of complements for the binary number system – 1’scomplement and 2’scomplement. V.2.1 The 1s Complement To form the negative of any number, first complement all the bits of that number. This result is known as the 1s complement of the original number. This requires changing every logic 1 bit in a number to logic 0, and every logic 0 bit to logic 1. For instance • 1’s complement of 110 is 001 • 1’s complement of 1011 is 0100 • 1’s complement of 1101111 is 0010000 V.2.2 The 2s Complement The 2’s complement is the convention used in most of the computers to represent negative numbers. To obtain the 2s complement of a number, there is a two-step process: 1. Take the 1s complement of the number by changing every logic 1 bit in the number to logic 0 bit, and change every logic 0 bit to logic 1 bit. 2. Add 1 to the 1s complement of the binary number. Now, we have the 2s complement of the original number. Here, we can notice that the MSB has become 1. Taking the 2s complement of the number will cause the MSB to become 1. Using n bits, the range of integer we can store using two’s complement is -2n-1 to 2n-1-1 For instance, • 2’s complement of 110 is 001 + 1 = 010 • 2’s complement of 1011 is 0100 + 1 = 0101 • 2’s complement of 1101111 is 0010000 + 1 = 0010001 V.2.3 Subtraction using 1’s and 2’s complements Here we do subtraction using addition! We use the signed 1’s complement or 2’s complement representation to represent the negative numbers. The subtraction here is just supposed to be an addition of a positive number and a negative number. Then:  (-A) – (+B) = (-A) + (-B) (+B in subtraction is changed to –B in addition)  (+A) – (+B) = (+A) + (-B) (+B in subtraction is changed to –B in addition)  (-A) – (-B) = (-A) + (+B) (-B in subtraction is changed to +B in addition)  (+A) – (-B) = (+A) + (+B) (-B in subtraction is changed to +B in addition) To carry out subtraction using complement method, follow these steps:  take the "complement" of the number we are subtracting (we will see how soon)  add it to to the number we are subtracting from  discard the extra "1" on the left If a carry out occurs, - Add it to the result in case of 1’s complement - Discard the carry out bit in case of 2’s complement Examples With 2’s complement 1. Add −8 to +3 (+3) 0000 0011 +(−8) 1111 1000 ----------------- (−5) 1111 1011 2. Add −5 to −2 (−2) 1111 1110 +(−5) 1111 1011 ----------------- (−7) 1 1111 1001 : discard carry-out With 1’s complement 3. Add −8 to +3 (+3) 0000 0011 +(−8) 1111 0111 -------------------------- (−5) 1111 1010 4. Add −5 to −2 (−2) 1111 1101 +(−5) 1111 1010 -------------------------- 1 1111 0111 +(1) V.2.4 Notion of Overflow 1: Add carry-out ---------------------------- (−7) 1111 1000 If the result of an arithmetic operation is to too large (positive or negative) to fit into the resultant bit-group, then arithmetic overflow occurs. In general, overflow occurs when adding two positive numbers produces a negative result, or when adding two negative numbers produces a positive result. Adding operands of unlike signs never produces an overflow Notice that discarding the carry out of the most significant bit during Two's Complement addition is a normal occurrence, and does not by itself indicate overflow As an example of overflow, consider adding (80 + 80 = 160)10, which produces a result of −9610 in 8 bit two's complement: 01010000 = 80 + 01010000 = 80 -------------- 10100000 = −96 (not 160 because the sign bit is 1.) (largest +ve number in 8 bits is 127) VI. BINARY CODING SCHEME The alphabetic data, numeric data, alphanumeric data, symbols, sound data and video data, all are represented as combination of bits in the computer. A code is made by combining bits of definite size. Binary Coding schemes represent the data such as alphabets, digits 0-9, and symbols in a standard code. A combination of bits represents a unique symbol in the data. The standard code enables any programmer to use the same combination of bits to represent a symbol in the data. The binary coding schemes that are most commonly used are  Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)  American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)  Extended Binary-coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC)  Unicode VI.1 Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) is a method of using binary digits to represent the decimal digits 0–9. A decimal digit is represented by four binary digits. The BCD coding is the binary equivalent of the decimal digit. BCD system was developed by the IBM (International Business Machines) corporation. In this system, each digit of a number is converted into its binary equivalent rather than converting the entire decimal number to its binary form. Similarly, letters and special characters can be coded in the binary form. Let us determine the BCD value for the decimal number 5319. Since there are four digits in the decimal number, there are four bytes in the BCD number. They are: Binary code decimal digits (0–9) are represented by using four bits. The valid combinations of bits and their respective values are shown in the table below. Table. Binary-coded Decimal To represent the signs + and -, any of the remaining 4 bits patterns can be used. One convention uses 1010 for + and 1011 for -. You can see that in one byte we can have either 2 digits or a sign and one digit. Here we must use the full 4-bits representation of any digit (including the leading 0s). Thus the BCD representation of 5319 is 0101001100011001 and not 101001100011001 VI.2 Extended Binary-coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) Once upon a time IBM invented EBCDIC. EBCDIC is an acronym for Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code. It is a single byte (8 bit) character encoding standard that is used in the IBM mainframe environment. IBM didn't invent just one version of EBCDIC either but several different incompatible versions. The computing friendly and user friendly thing would have been to use the already in existence ASCII standard.  The Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code(EBCDIC) uses 8 bits (4 bits for zone, 4 bits for digit) to represent a symbol in the data.  EBCDIC allows 28= 256 combinations of bits.  256 unique symbols are represented using EBCDIC code. It represents decimal numbers (0 9), lower case letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), Special characters, and Control characters (printable and non-printable e.g. for cursor movement, printer vertical spacing etc.).  EBCDIC codes are used, mainly, in the mainframe computers. VI.3 American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) The name ASCII is an acronym for: American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a character encoding standard developed several decades ago to provide a standard way for digital machines to encode characters. ASCII codes are of two types: ASCII-7 & ASCII-8.  ASCII-7is a 7-bit standard ASCII code. In ASCII-7, the first 3 bits are the zone bits and the next 4 bits are for the digits. ASCII-7 allows 27= 128 combinations. 128 unique symbols are represented using ASCII-7.  ASCII-8is an extended version of ASCII-7. It is an 8-bit code having 4 bits for zone and 4 bits for the digit. ASCII-8 allows 28= 256 combinations. ASCII-8 represents 256 unique symbols. ASCII is used widely to represent data in computers.  The ASCII-8 code represents 256 symbols. o Codes 0 to 31 represent control characters (non-printable), because they are used for actions like, Carriage return (CR), Bell (BEL) etc. o Codes 48 to 57 stand for numeric 0-9. o Codes 65 to 90 stand for uppercase letters A-Z. o Codes 97 to 122 stand for lowercase letters a-z. o Codes 128-255 are the extended ASCII codes. VI.4 Unicode Unicode is a universal character encoding standard for the representation of text which includes letters, numbers and symbols in multi-lingual environments. It uses 32 bits (232= 4164895296 combinations) to represent a symbol in the data. Unicode codes can uniquely represent any character or symbol present in any language like Chinese, Japanese, included mathematical and scientific symbols are also represented in Unicode codes. An advantage of Unicode is that it is compatible with the ASCII-8 codes. The first 256 codes in Unicode are identical to the ASCII-8 codes. VI.5 IEEE notation IEEE Floating Point Format Floating point notation is essentially the same as scientific notation, only translated to binary. There are three fields: the sign (which is the sign of the number), the exponent (some representations have used a separate exponent sign and exponent magnitude; IEEE format does not), and a significand (mantissa). 1. The Sign of Mantissa This is as simple as the name. 0 represents a positive number while 1 represents a negative number. 2. The Biased exponent The exponent field needs to represent both positive and negative exponents. A bias is added to the actual exponent in order to get the stored exponent. 3. The Normalised Mantissa The mantissa is part of a number in scientific notation or a floating-point number, consisting of its significant digits. Here we have only 2 digits, i.e. O and 1. So a normalised mantissa is one with only one 1 to the left of the decimal. Example: 85.125 85 = 1010101 0.125 = 001 85.125 = 1010101.001 =1.010101001 x 2^6 sign = 0 1. Single precision: biased exponent 127+6=133 133 = 10000101 Normalised mantisa = 010101001 we will add 0's to complete the 23 bits The IEEE 754 Single precision is: = 0 10000101 01010100100000000000000 This can be written in hexadecimal form 42AA4000 2. Double precision: biased exponent 1023+6=1029 1029 = 10000000101 Normalised mantisa = 010101001 we will add 0's to complete the 52 bits The IEEE 754 Double precision is: = 0 10000000101 0101010010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 This can be written in hexadecimal form 4055480000000000 EXERCISES MCQ 1.

BOOLEAN ALGEBRA Boolean algebra is a mathematical system, developed by the English mathematician, George Boole. It is the mathematics of digital systems. Boolean algebra deals with the binary number system, the variables used in the Boolean equations have only two possible values (0 or 1). Thus, for performing the logical algebraic operations, that is, 'addition' and 'multiplication', Boolean algebra follows certain rules. II.1 Rules of Boolean algebra These rules are shown in the table below. A, B and C represent a single variable or a combination variables. Addition Rules (a) Multiplication Rules (b) 1 0 + 0 = 0 0 · 0 = 0 2 0 + 1 = 1 0 · 1 = 0 3 1 + 0 = 1 1 · 0 = 0 4 1 + 1 = 1 1 · 1 = 1 5 A + 0 = A A · 0 = 0 6 A + 1 = 1 A · 1 = A 7 A + A = A A · A = A 8 A + Ā = 1 A · Ā = 0 9 A + AB = A 10 A(A+B)=A A + Ā B = A + B 11 12 (A+B)(A+C) = A + BC AC+AC = A(B+C) These rules can be checked by the use of truth table. Some of these rules can be derived from simpler identities derived in this package. II.2 Laws of Boolean algebra The following are different laws of Boolean algebra: Law 13 Addition (a) Commutative 14 A + B = B + A Multiplication (b) AB = BA Associative 15 A + (B + C) = Distributive 16 (A + B) + C (a) A (BC) = (AB) C (b) A (B + C) = AB + AC A + (BC) = (A + B) (A + C) De Morgan's Law 17 (a) (b) ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ = 𝐴.𝐵̅ � �+𝐵 𝐴𝐵 ̅̅̅̅ = 𝐴+𝐵̅ Some proofs Rule 9.

(A + B)(A + C) = A + BC (A + B)(A + C) = AA + AC + AB + BC = A( 1 + C) + AB + BC = A. 1 + AB + BC = A(1 + B) + BC = A. 1 + BC = A + BC DEMORGAN'S THEOREMS: 𝑋𝑌 ̅̅̅̅ = 𝑋̅ + 𝑌̅ & 𝑋 + 𝑌 ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ = 𝑋̅ 𝑌̅ XI. LOGIC GATES The term gate is used to describe the set of the basic electronic components, which when combined with each other are able to perform complex logical and arithmetic operations. As discussed earlier, everything in the digital world is based on the binary number system. Numerically, this involves only two symbols: 0 and 1. Thus, when dealing with digital logic, we can specify that: 0 = False = No. 1 = True = Yes I.1 Logic Operations and basic logic gates There exist basically three logical operations: AND, OR and NOT. Each operator I.1.1 AND Operation and AND Gate The AND gate is composed of two or more inputs and a single output, and performs logical multiplication. In the AND operation, a result of 1 occurs when all the input variables are 1. The standard symbol for the AND gate and its truth are shown below. The expression X = A.B reads as 'X equals A AND B'. A B X=A.B 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 I.1.2 OR Operation and OR Gate According to the OR operation, a result of 1 is obtained when any of the input variable is 1. In addition, the OR operation produces a result of 0 only when all the input variables are 0. Page 68 The OR gate is composed of two or more inputs and a single output, and performs logical addition. The + sign stands for the OR operation, and not for ordinary addition. A B X=A+B 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 I.1.3 1 1 1 NOT Operation and NOT Gate Unlike the “OR” and “AND” operations the NOT operation can be performed on a single input variable. The NOT gate performs a basic logic function called inversion or complementation. In terms of bits, the NOT operation changes '1' to '0' and vice versa. A 𝑋=𝐴 0 1 1 0 x = A′ or Ā where the prime (′) represents the NOT operation. This expression is read as: x equals the inverse of A. x equals the complement of A. XII. COMBINATION OF LOGIC GATES Using combinations of logic gates, complex operations can be performed, since in practice, there is a limit to the number of gates that can be packed into a given physical space. Some basic combination gates are: NAND gate, NOR gate, Exclusive-OR (XOR) and Exclusive NOR (XNOR) gate IV.1. NAND Gate The term 'NAND' is formed by the combination of NOT-AND and implies an AND function with an inverted output. 0 A B 𝑋=𝐴↑𝐵 (NAND) 0 0 1 1 1 I V. 2. NOR Gate 1 0 1 1 1 0 The term 'NOR' is formed by the combination of NOT-OR and implies an OR function with an inverted output. IV.3. Exclusive-OR (XOR) and Exclusive-NOR (XNOR) Gate A B 𝑋=𝐴↓𝐵 (NOR) 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 Page 69 These gates are usually formed from the combination of the other logic gates already discussed. However, because of their functional importance, these gates are treated as basic gates with their own unique symbols. The truth tables and the standard symbols for the XOR and XNOR gates, are listed below respectively. A B � � =𝐴⨁𝐵 (XOR) 𝑋=𝐴⨀𝐵 (XNOR) 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 The exclusive-OR gate and exclusive-NOR gate are denoted by the ⨁ and ⨀, respectively. In addition, these gates perform the following Boolean functions: � �⨁𝐵 =𝐴𝐵̅+𝐴𝐵 � �⨀𝐵 =𝐴𝐵+𝐴𝐵̅ IV.4. Minimisation with NAND or NOR gates When designing combinatorial circuits, efficiency is sought by minimising the number of gates in a circuit. It has been proved that all the basic logical operators can be represented using only NAND operator or NOR operator. They are then called universal gates Example (a) 𝐴= 𝐴+𝐴= 𝐴𝐴 ̅̅̅̅ = 𝐴 ↑ 𝐴 c) 𝐴 + 𝐵 = 𝐴+𝐵 d) 𝐴 + 𝐵 = 𝐴+𝐵 ̿̿̿̿̿̿̿̿ = 𝐴𝐵̅ (b) 𝐴= 𝐴+𝐴 ̅̅̅̅ + 𝐴↑ 𝐵̅ +(𝐴 ↑ 𝐴) ↑ (𝐵 ↑ 𝐵) ̿̿̿̿̿̿̿̿ = 𝐴 + 𝐵 ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ + 𝐴 + 𝐵 ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ = 𝐴 ↓ 𝐴 ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ = (𝐴 ↓ 𝐵) + (𝐴 ↓ 𝐵) ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ = (𝐴 ↓ 𝐵) ↓ (𝐴 ↓ 𝐵) XIII. LOGIC CIRCUITS AND BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS IV.1 Definition A Logic circuit to a number of gates joined together to produce a specific output from given inputs. For example, let’s consider the following circuit: It contains three inputs A, B and C A Boolean function is an expression formed with binary variables and logical operators (OR, AND, NOT and equal sign). For example, the Boolean function of the above logic circuit can be expressed X = f(A, B, C) = A · B + A · C. The function can be represented by a truth table as follow Inputs A B C Output A.B 0 0 0 A.C F 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 Page 70 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 IV.2 Algebraic expression of a Boolean expression In general, the unique algebraic expression for any Boolean function can be obtained from its truth table by using an: - - OR operator to combined all minterms for which the function is equal to 1. AND operator to combined all maxterms for which the function is equal to 0 A minterm, denoted as mi, where 0 ≤ i < 2n, is a product (AND) of the n variables in which each variable is complemented if the value assigned to it is 0, and uncomplemented if it is 1.  1-minterms= minterms for which the function F = 1.  0-minterms= minterms for which the function F= 0. A maxterm, denoted as Mi, where 0 ≤ i < 2n, is a sum (OR) of the n variables in which each variable is complemented if the value assigned to it is 1, and uncomplemented if it is 0. Note that each maxterm is the complement of its corresponding minterm and vice versa. Any Boolean function can be expressed as a sum (OR) of its 1-minterms (sum of products SOP) or product of 0-maxterms (product of sums POS). Example: Let us consider the function F = A·B + A·C whose truth table is given as shown below Inputs Output A B C F Minterms Maxterm 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 � �𝐵̅𝐶 � �+𝐵+𝐶 0 0 1 0 � �𝐵̅𝐶 0 0 1 1 � �𝐵𝐶 � �+𝐵+𝐶 � �+𝐵̅+𝐶 0 1 0 0 0 � �𝐵𝐶 � �𝐵̅𝐶 � �+𝐵̅+𝐶 � �+𝐵+𝐶 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 � �𝐵̅𝐶 1 � �𝐵𝐶 � �+𝐵+𝐶 � �+𝐵̅+𝐶 Page 71 1 1 1 1 ABC � �+𝐵̅+𝐶 The function F can then be expressed as the sum of minterms corresponding to the value 1 of F or as the product of maxterms corresponding to the value 0 of F. � � =∑𝑚(5,6,7) = m5 + m6+ m7 = 𝐴𝐵̅𝐶 + 𝐴𝐵𝐶+ABC � � =∏𝑀(0,1,2,3,4) = M0 + M1 + M2 + M3 + M4 = (𝐴 +𝐵 +𝐶)(𝐴+𝐵+𝐶)(𝐴+𝐵̅+𝐶)(𝐴+𝐵̅+𝐶)(𝐴+𝐵+𝐶) XIV. SIMPLIFICATION OF LOGIC FUNCTIONS A simplified Boolean expression uses the fewest gates possible to implement a given expression. V.1 Simplification using Boolean algebra Using the theorems of Boolean Algebra, the algebraic forms of functions can often be simplified, which leads to simpler (and cheaper) implementations. Example: Using Boolean algebra techniques, simplify this expression: AB + A(B + C) + B(B + C) Solution Step 1: Apply the distributive law to the second and third terms in the expression, as follows: AB + AB + AC + BB + BC Step 2: Apply rule 7b (BB = B) to the fourth term. AB + AB + AC + B + BC Step 3: Apply rule 7a (AB + AB = AB) to the first two terms. AB + AC + B + BC Step 4: Apply rule 10 (B + BC = B) to the last two terms. AB + AC + B Step 5: Apply rule 10 (AB + B = B) to the first and third terms. B+AC At this point the expression is simplified as much as possible. V.2 Simplification using Karnaugh Map A Karnaugh map provides a systematic method for simplifying Boolean expressions and, if properly used, will produce the simplest SOP or POS expression possible, known as the minimum expression. A Karnaugh map is similar to a truth table because it presents all of the possible values of input variables and the resulting output for each value. Instead of being organized into columns and rows like a truth table, the Karnaugh map is an array of cells in which each cell represents a binary value of the input variables. The number of cells in a Karnaugh map is equal to the total number of possible input variable combinations as is the number of rows in a truth table. For three variables, the number of cells is 23= 8. For four variables, the number of cells is 24= 16. Example: Page 72 (Practical example and explanation to be given) XV. EXAMPLE OF BASIC DIGITAL CIRCUIT VI.1 A half adder The half adder adds two single binary digits A and B. It has two outputs, sum (S) and carry (C). The carry signal represents an overflow into the next digit of a multi-digit addition. The The simplest half-adder design, pictured on the right, incorporates an XOR gate for S and an AND gate for C.

INTRODUCTION TO OPERATING SYSTEM An Operating system is a collection of programs that controls the execution of application programs and acts as an interface between the user of a computer and the computer hardware. Operating system along with hardware, application and other system software, and users constitute a computer system. It is the most important part of any computer system. At the simplest level, an operating system does two things: 1. It manages the hardware and software resources of the system. These resources include such things as the processor, memory, disk space and more 2. It acts as an interface between the user and the physical machine that is it provides a stable, consistent way for applications to deal with the hardware without having to know all the details of the hardware. IV. SERVICES OF AN OS An operating system provides services to programs and to the users of those programs. - - It provides programs an environment for the execution of programs. It provides users, services to execute the programs in a convenient manner. The common service provided by the operating system is listed below. 1. Program execution: Operating system loads a program into memory and executes the program. The program must be able to end its execution, either normally or abnormally. 2. I/O operation: I/O means any file or any specific I/O device. Program may require any I/O device while running. So operating system must provide the required I/O. 3. File system manipulation: Program needs to read a file or write a file. The operating system gives the permission to the program for operation on file. 4. Communications: Data transfer between two processes is required for some time. The both processes are on the one computer or on different computer but connected through computer network. Communication may be implemented by two methods: Shared memory and Message passing. 5. Error detection: The operating system constantly needs to be aware of possible errors in CPU, in I/O devices or in memory hardware. It should take the appropriate action to ensure correct and consistent computing. 6. Resource allocation: Operating system manages different types of resources require special allocation code, i.e. main memory, CPU cycles and file storage. 7. Protection: Protection involves ensuring that all access to system resources is controlled. Security starts with each user having to authenticate to the system, usually by means of a password. External I/O devices must be also protected from invalid access attempts. Page 78 V. EVOLUTION OF OS Historically operating systems have been tightly related to the computer architecture. Operating systems have evolved through a number of distinct phases or generations which corresponds roughly to the decades. III.1 The 1940's - First Generations: Serial Processing The earliest electronic digital computers had no operating systems. Machines of the time were so primitive that programs were often entered one bit at time on rows of mechanical switches (plug boards). Programming languages were unknown (not even assembly languages). III.2 The 1950's - Second Generation: By the early 1950's, The General Motors Research Laboratories implemented the first operating systems in early 1950's for their IBM 701. The system of the 50's generally ran one job at a time. These were called single-stream batch processing systems because programs and data were submitted in groups or batches. III.3 The 1960's - Third Generation The systems of the 1960's were also batch processing systems, but they were able to take better advantage of the computer's resources by running several jobs at once. So operating systems designers developed the concept of multiprogramming in which several jobs are in main memory at once; a processor is switched from job to job as needed to keep several jobs advancing while keeping the peripheral devices in use. Another feature present in this generation was time-sharing technique, a variant of multiprogramming technique, in which each user has an on-line (i.e., directly connected) terminal. III.4 Fourth Generation Microprocessor technology evolved to the point that it become possible to build desktop computers as powerful as the mainframes of the 1970s. Two operating systems have dominated the personal computer scene: MS-DOS, written by Microsoft, Inc. for the IBM PC and other machines using the Intel 8088 CPU and its successors, and UNIX, which is dominant on the large personal computers using the Motorola 6899 CPU family. Page 79 VI. OPERATNG SYSTEM INTERFACES Almost all operating systems have a user interface (UI). This interface can take several forms. IV.1 command-line interface(CLI) With a command line interface the user interacts with the computer by typing commands. An interaction with a computer using a command line interface usually follows these two steps : - - The user types a command e.g. "dir". The computer carries out the command and displays its results. Examples of systems which use a command line interface are: MS-DOS, BBC Micro IV.2 Menu-Driven Interface With a menu driven interface the user interacts with the computer by selecting options from a menu. A typical program will have many menus which the user can access. Menus can be either full screen or pull-down. Pull down menus are accessed by selecting the menu from a menu bar. Pop-up menus are activated by pressing a button on the mouse. IV.3 Graphical User Interface (GUI) With a Graphical User Interface (GUI) the user interacts with the computer by using a pointing device such as a mouse or trackball. The most popular form of GUI is a Windows, Icon, Menu and Pointer (WIMP) system. The important features of a WIMP system are : 1. Window : An area of the screen which is used to display a particular program or piece of work. Many windows can be displayed on the screen at the same time. 2. Icon : An informative picture / symbol displayed on the screen which the user chooses to select an action. 3. Menu : A list of options which the user can pick from. Menus can be pull-down (selected from a menu bar at the top of the screen) or pop-up (selected by pressing a mouse button). e.g. 4. Pointer : A symbol such as an arrow which is moved by a pointing device and can be used to select objects. When you use a program such as a word processor that has a WIMP interface it is often the case that the document you are creating looks exactly the same on the screen as it will when it is printed out. If this is the case then the program is described as being WYSIWYG. This stands for “What You See Is What You Get”. VII. OPERATING SYSTEM CONCEPTS V.1 OS Kernel Page 80 The lowest level of any operating system is its kernel. This is the first layer of software loaded into memory when a system boots or starts up. The kernel provides access to various common core services to all other system and application programs. These services include, but are not limited to: disk access, memory management, task scheduling, and access to other hardware devices. V.2 Operating system modes Many CPU modes can be implemented by an Operating System: But en general a CPU can be either in kernel mode or User mode.  In kernel mode, also called master mode, supervisor mode, privileged mode, supervisor state, etc, the CPU has instructions to manage memory and how it can be accessed, plus the ability to access peripheral devices like disks and network cards. The CPU can also switch itself from one running program to another. It is an unrestricted mode  In user mode, access to memory is limited to only some memory locations, and access to peripheral devices is denied. The ability to keep or relinquish the CPU is removed, and the CPU can be taken away from a program at any time. Now, all programs will be run in user mode, and this prevents them from accessing the data in other programs, as well as preventing the disk etc. V.3 System call In computing, a system call is how a program requests a service from an operating system's kernel that it does not normally have permission to run. System calls provide the interface between a process and the operating system. Application developers often do not have direct access to the system calls, but can access them through an application programming interface (API). The functions that are included in the API invoke the actual system calls. V.4 Interrupt An interrupt in an interruption in the normal execution of the program. When the CPU is interrupt, then it stops its current activities like execution of the program. And transfer the control to interrupting device to check the interrupt. The three types of interrupts are  software interrupts or trap (syscall) - invoked by software  external interrupts - invoked by external devices  exceptions - invoked by the processor when errors occur Interrupt Handling The code that is installed at the target address for interrupts is called an interrupt handler. The first thing that it has to do is save the state of the currently executing process. Then it calls a subprogram Page 81 to deal with the specific type of interrupt. When that subprogram returns, the interrupt handler restores the state of the process that was executing when the interrupt occurred. VIII. TYPES OF OPERATING SYSTEMS Following are few of the important types of operating system which are most commonly used. VI.1 Real-time operating system (RTOS) Abbreviated as RTOS, a real-time operating system or embedded operating system is a computer operating system designed to handle events as they occur. Real Time System is used at those Places in which we Requires higher and Timely Response. These Types of Systems are used in Reservation. They are also found and used in robotics, communications, and has various military and government uses. VI.2 Single-user, single task As the name implies, this operating system is designed to manage the computer so that one user can effectively do one thing at a time. The Palm OS for Palm handheld computers is a good example of a modern single-user, single-task operating system. VI.3 Single-user, multi-tasking This is the type of operating system most people use on their desktop and laptop computers today. Microsoft's Windows and Apple's MacOS platforms are both examples of operating systems that will let a single user have several programs in operation at the same time. VI.4 Multi-user A multi-user operating system allows many different users to take advantage of the computer's resources simultaneously. Unix, VMS and mainframe operating systems, such as MVS, are examples of multi-user operating systems. VI.5 Multiprocessing OS Multiprogramming OS have two or more processors for a single running process. Processing takes place in parallel and is also called parallel processing. Each processor works on different parts of the same task, or, on two or more different tasks. Linux, UNIX and Windows 7 are examples of multiprocessing OS. VI.6 Time sharing Operating System: Page 82 Multitasking or time sharing refers to term where multiple jobs are executed by the CPU simultaneously by switching between them. Switches occur so frequently that the users may interact with each program while it is running. VI.7 Distributed operating System Distributed means “data is stored and processed on multiples locations”. Distributed Operating Systems manages a collection of independent computers and make them appear to the users of the system as a single computer. Users are not aware of multiplicity of machines. Access to remote resources is similar to access to local resources. VI.8 Network operating System Network Operating System (NOS) runs on a server and and provides server the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions. The primary purpose of the network operating system is to allow shared file and printer access among multiple computers in a network, typically a LAN, a private network or to other networks. Examples of network operating systems are Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Windows Server 2008, UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, Novell NetWare, and BSD. VI.9 Embedded Operating System: An embedded operating system refers to the operating system that is self-contained in the device and resident in the read-only memory (ROM). IX. PROCESS MANAGEMENT VII. 1 What is a process? A process is a name given to a program instance that has been loaded into memory and managed by the operating system. Shortly, a process is a program in execution. (Program = static file (image). Process = executing program = program + execution state) VII.2 Process States A Process in execution will have to pass through different stages : → New: The process is being created.. → Ready: The process is ready to be assigned to the processor. → Running: The Process is currently using CPU to execute its instruction is in this stage. → Waiting: The process is waiting for signal from some other process. → Terminated: The Process that finishes its execution will be terminated. Steps followed in the Process execution:  A Process when first created will be in New stage, then when it is waiting for CPU time in order to get executed will in ready stage. In Ready stage Process will be waiting for CPU time in Ready Queue (A queue where Process waits for the CPU).  Once the CPU become free and process acquires it, Process will enter into Running stage where it will execute its instructions. If during this stage any interrupt occurs then it will move back to ready stage and wait for the scheduler dispatcher. If it has I/O operation then it will move to Waiting stage where it will perform I/O operation and then move back to ready stage and waits for the scheduler dispatcher.  After the process get executed it will terminate. Page 83 The change of the state of the process from one form to another is called context change and this course of action is known as context switching. Fig: Process states VII.3 Process Scheduling In a multiprogrammed system, at any given time, several processes will be competing for the CPU time. Thus, a choice has to be made which process to allocate the CPU next. This procedure of determining the next process to be executed on the CPU is called process scheduling and the module of operating system that makes this decision is called a scheduler. VII.3.1 Preemptive and Non-preemptive Scheduling Preemptive scheduling allows a process to be interrupted in the midst of its execution, taking the CPU away and allocating it to another process. Nonpreemptive scheduling ensures that a process relinquishes control of the CPU only when it finishes with its current CPU burst. CPU-scheduling decisions may take place under the following four circumstances: 1. When a process switches from the running state to the waiting state (for example, as the result of an I/O request,…). 2. When a process switches from the running state to the ready state (for example, when an interrupt occurs). 3. When a process switches from the waiting state to the ready state (for example, at completion of I/O, on a semaphore, or for some other reason). 4. When a process terminates. For situations 1 and 4, there is no choice in terms of scheduling. A new process (if one exists in the ready queue) must be selected for execution. There is a choice, however, for situations 2 and 3. When scheduling takes place only under circumstances 1 and 4, we say that the scheduling scheme is nonpreemptive or cooperative; otherwise, it is pre-emptive. VII.3.2 Algorithm to select process to execute The scheduler uses some scheduling procedure to carry out the selection of a process for execution. The efficiency of each algorithm is judged according to the average waiting time and the average turnaround time.  Burst time: It is the amount of time a process uses the CPU for a single time.  Waiting time - amount of time a process has been waiting in the ready queue (waitingTime = startTime – arrivalTime)  Turnaround time - It’s the total time taken by the process between starting and the completion. (turnaroundTime = burstTime + waitingTime = finishTime- arrivalTime) Page 84 Page 85 1) First-Come-First-Served: As the name suggests, in FCFS scheduling, the processes are executed in the order of their arrival in the ready queue. To implement FCFS scheduling procedure, the ready queue is managed as a first-in first-out (FIFO) queue. It is a nonpreemptive scheduling. Example: Process Arrival time Burst time Service Time Wait Time : Service Time - Arrival Time P0 0 5 0 0 - 0 = 0 P1 1 3 5 5 - 1 = 4 P2 2 8 8 8 - 2 = 6 P3 3 6 16 16 - 3 = 13 Average Wait Time: (0+4+6+13) / 4 = 5.55 2) Round Robin: Here each process is provided a fix time to execute called quantum or slice time. After this time has elapsed, the process is preempted and added to the end of the ready queue and other process executes for given time period. Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes. Example: Quantum = 3 Process Arrival time Bust Time Wait Time : Service Time - Arrival Time P0 0 5 (0-0) + (12-3) = 9 P1 1 3 (3-1) = 2 P2 2 8 (6-2) + (14-9) + (19-17) = 11 P3 3 6 (9-3) + (17-12) = 11 Average Wait Time: (9+2+11+11) / 4 = 8.25 3) Shortest-Job-First Scheduling, SJF The idea behind the SJF algorithm is to pick the quickest fastest little job that needs to be done, get it out of the way first, and then pick the next smallest fastest job to do next. (Technically this algorithm picks a process based on the next shortest CPU burst, not the overall process time.). For example, the Gantt chart below is based upon the following CPU burst times, (and the assumption that all jobs arrive at the same time.) Process Arrival time Burst time Service Time Wait Time : Service Time - Arrival Time P0 0 5 0 0 - 0 = 0 P1 1 3 5 5 - 1 = 4 P2 2 8 14 14 - 2 = 12 P3 3 6 8 8 - 3 = 5 14 17 19 21 P3 Average Wait Time: (0+4+12+5) / 4 = 5.250 4) Priority Scheduling P2 Each process is assigned a priority. Process with highest priority is to be executed first and so on. Processes with same priority are executed on first come first serve basis. Priority can be decided based on memory requirements, time requirements or any other resource requirement. P0 P3 5 Wait time of each process is following P1 11 14 Process Wait Time : Service Time - Arrival Time 0 - 0 = 0 P0 11 - 1 = 10 P1 14 - 2 = 12 P2 5 - 3 = 2 P3 Average Wait Time: (0+10+12+2) / 4 = 6 5) Shortest-Remaining-Time (SRT) Scheduling Shortest remaining time, also known as shortest remaining time first (SRTF), is the preemtive counterpart of SJF and useful in time-sharing environment. The process with the smallest estimated run-time to completion is run next, including new arrivals. It picks a process and lets it run for a maximum of some fixed time. V.5 Critical Section The key to preventing trouble involving shared storage is find some way to prohibit more than one process from reading and writing the shared data simultaneously. The part of the program where the shared memory is accessed is called the Critical Section or critical regions. The most common way to avoid race conditions is to mark the critical sections of code that are accessing shared data Page 86 and ensure that only one process is ever executing code in the critical section at a given time. This property is called mutual exclusion. X. DEADLOCK VIII.1 Definition and examples of deadlock Let’s consider the situation where there are two utility programs A and B that each want to copy a file from tape to disk and print the file to printer - A holds tape and disk, then requests for a printer - - - B holds printer, then requests for tape and disk A tries to get ownership of the printer, but is told to wait for B to release it. B tries to get ownership of the tape, but is told to wait for A to release it. None of the process will be able to print and the two processes will remain in deadlock. A deadlock occurs when an every member of a set of processes is waiting for an event that can only be caused by a member of the set. Other examples of deadlocks 1) Bridge traffic can only be in one direction.  Each entrance of the bridge can be viewed as a resource.  Starvation is possible (Processes wait indefinitely). 2) In the automotive world deadlocks are called gridlocks.  The processes are the cars.  The resources are the spaces occupied by the cars VIII.2 Necessary Conditions The following four conditions (Coffman; Havender) are necessary but not sufficient for deadlock. Repeat: They are not sufficient. 1. Mutual exclusion: A resource can be assigned to at most one process at a time (no sharing). 2. Hold and wait: A processing holding a resource is permitted to request another. 3. No preemption: A process must release its resources; they cannot be taken away. 4. Circular wait: There must be a chain of processes such that each member of the chain is waiting for a resource held by the next member of the chain. VIII.3 Resource allocation graph The deadlock conditions can be modelled using a directed graph called a resource allocation graph (RAG). Below is the Resource Allocation Graph,  The processes are circles.  The resources are squares.  An arc (directed line) from a process P to a resource R signifies that process P has requested (but not yet been allocated) resource R.  An arc from a resource R to a process P indicates that process P has been allocated resource R. Page 87 If the graph does not contain a cycle, then no deadlock exists. If the graph does contain a cycle, then a deadlock might exist an example of a no deadlock situation. an example of a deadlock situation NB: The presence of a cycle in a RAG is a necessary and not a sufficient condition for the deadlock to occur. It becomes sufficient when there is only one instance of each resource. VIII.4 Methods for Handling Deadlocks Generally speaking there are three ways of handling deadlocks: 1. Deadlock prevention or avoidance - Do not allow the system to get into a deadlocked state. 2. Deadlock detection and recovery - Abort a process or preempt some resources when deadlocks are detected. 3. The Ostrich Approach: sticks your head in the sand and ignores the problem. This approach can be quite useful if you believe that they are rarest chances of deadlock occurrence. XI. MEMORY MANAGEMENT In addition to managing processes, the operating system also manages the primary memory of the computer. The part of the operating system that handles this job is called the memory manager. The major tasks accomplished by the memory manager so that all the processes function in harmony are as follows: • Allocation and Relocation: Each process must have enough memory to execute. • Protection and Sharing: A process should not run into the memory space of another process. IX.1 Relocation Page 88 When a process is to be executed, it has to be loaded from the secondary storage (like hard disk) to the main memory (RAM). This is called process loading. Since, main memory is limited and other processes also need it for their execution, an operating system swaps the two processes, which is called swapping. Once the process is 'swapped out', it is uncertain to predict when it will be 'swapped in' because of the number of processes running concurrently IX.2 Protection and Sharing In multiprogrammed systems, as a number of processes may reside in the main memory at the same time, there is a possibility that a user program during execution may access the memory location allocated either to other user processes or to the operating system. It is the responsibility of the memory manager to protect the operating system from being accessed by other processes and the processes from one another. IX.3 Memory Allocation The main challenge of efficiently managing memory comes when a system has multiple processes running at the same time. In such a case, the memory manager can allocate a portion of primary memory to each process for its own use. Different strategies are used to allocate space to processes competing for memory. Three of the most popular are: best fit, first fit and worst fit. • Best Fit: In this case, the memory manager places a process in the smallest block of unallocated memory in which it will fit. For example, a process requests 12 KB of memory and the memory manager currently has a list of unallocated blocks of 6 KB, 14 KB, 19 KB, 11 KB and 13 KB blocks. The best fit strategy will allocate 12 KB of the 13 KB block to the process. • First Fit: The memory manager places the process in the first unallocated block that is large enough to accommodate the process. Using the same example to fulfil 12 KB request, first fit will allocate 12 KB of the 14 KB block to the process. • Worst Fit: The memory manager places the process in the largest block of unallocated memory available. To furnish the 12 KB request again, worst fit will allocate 12 KB of the 19 KB block to the process, leaving a 7 KB block for future use. Fig: Strategies for Memory Allocation IX.4 Paging and segmentation 1) Paging Page 89 Paging is a memory management scheme that allows the processes to be stored non-contiguously in the memory. The memory is divided into fixed size chunks called page frames. The operating system breaks the address space of the program (the collection of addresses used by the program) into fixed size chunks called pages, which are of same size as that of page frames. Generally, page size is of 4 KB. However, some systems support even larger page sizes such as 8 KB and 4 MB. When a process is to be executed, its pages are loaded into unallocated page frames (not necessarily contiguous). The main advantage of paging is that it minimizes the problem of fragmentation since memory allocated is always in fixed units and any free frame can be allocated to a process. 2) Segmentation Segmentation is a Memory Management technique in which memory is divided into variable sized chunks which can be allocated to processes. Each chunk is called a segment. A table stores the information about all such segments and is called Global Descriptor Table (GDT). A GDT entry is called Global Descriptor. 3) Difference between paging and segmentation:- Paging and segmentation are closed relative to each other but they have following difference. → Paging divides the virtual memory in physical memory areas while the segmentation divides it logically. → Paging divides the memory in fixed length memory areas while segmentation divides into variable length memory areas. → In segmentation a full logical portion of the process in loaded, but in paging information about page is loaded. → The segments are large length as compare to page. → In segmentation memory is divided into segments through software and in paging the memory in divided through hardware. IX.5 Concept of Virtual Memory IX.5.1 What is virtual memory Virtual memory is the capability of the operating system that enables programs to address more memory locations than are actually provided in main memory. It is a method of using the computer hard drive to provide extra memory for the computer. Segments of memory are stored on the hard drive known as pages. When a segment of memory is requested that is not in memory it is moved from the virtual memory to an actual memory address. The operating system manages virtual address spaces and the assignment of real memory to virtual memory. Address translation hardware in the CPU, often referred to as a memory management unit or MMU, automatically translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Virtual memory allows for very effective multiprogramming and relieves the user from the unnecessarily tight constraints of main memory Fig: illustration of the concept of virtual memory Page 90 IX.5.2 Page Faults A page fault is an interrupt that occurs when a software program attempts to access an invalid page in memory. A page fault occurs when a program cannot find a page that it’s looking for in the physical memory, which means that the program would have to access the paging file (which resides on the hard disk) to retrieve the desired page. XII. FILE MANAGEMENT X.1 Notion of file and file management system File can be defined as a collection of related information recorded on secondary storage (e.g., disks). Almost all information stored in a computer must be in a file. a location for storing files on your computer is called a folder or a directory. A file management system is that set of system software that provides services to users and applications in the use of files. Following objectives for a file management system:  To meet the data management needs and requirements of the user which include storage of data and the ability to perform the aforementioned operations.  To guarantee, to the extent possible, that the data in the file are valid.  To optimize performance, both from the system point of view in terms of overall throughput.  To provide I/O support for a variety of storage device types.  To minimize or eliminate the potential for lost or destroyed data.  To provide a standardized set of I/O interface routines to use processes. X.2 What is a File system? 1) Definition File system is a system for organizing directories and files, generally in terms of how it is implemented in the disk operating system. While the memory manager is responsible for the maintenance of primary memory, the file manager is responsible for the maintenance of the file system. 2) Example of file systems a) Windows file systems → FAT (File Allocation Table): FAT file system is one of the most simple types of file systems. There exist different types of FAT: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32. The number in FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 stands for the number if bits used to enumerate file system block. This means that FAT12 may use up to 4096 different block references, FAT16 - 65536 and FAT32 - 4294967296. → NTFS (New Technology File System): This is a default file system for disk partitions and the only file system that is supported for disk partitions over 32GB. → ReFS (Resilient File System):: ReFS is the latest development of Microsoft presently available for Windows 8 Servers. b) MacOS file systems Apple Mac OS operating system applies HFS+ file system, an extension to their own HFS file system that was used on old Macintosh computers. HFS+ file system is applied to Apple desktop products, including Mac computers, iPhone, iPod, as well as Apple X Server products. Advanced server Page 91 products also use Apple Xsan file system, clustered file system derived from StorNext or CentraVision file systems. c) Linux file systems Among huge amount of various file system types the most popular Linux file systems nowadays are: → Ext2, Ext3, Ext4 - 'native' Linux file system. This file system falls under active developments and improvements. Ext4 file system is frequently used as 'root' file system for most Linux installations. → ReiserFS - alternative Linux file system designed to store huge amount of small files. → XFS - file system derived from SGI company that initially used it for their IRIX servers. Now XFS specifications are implemented in Linux. → JFS - file system developed by IBM for their powerful computing systems. Currently this file system is open-source and is implemented in most modern Linux distributions. d) BSD, Solaris, Unix file systems → UFS (Unix File System) also often referred to FFS (Fast File System – fast compared to a previous file system used for Unix). → ZFS for Solaris, XIII. DEVICE MANAGEMENT Device management in an operating system refers to the process of managing various devices connected to the computer. The device manager manages the hardware resources and provides an interface to the hardware for application programs. A device communicates with the computer system by sending signals over a cable. The device communicates with the machine through a connection point called port. Broadly, managing input and output is a matter of managing queues and buffers. A buffer is a temporary storage area that takes a stream of bits from a device like keyboard to a serial communication port. Buffers hold the bits and then release them to the CPU at a convenient rate so that the CPU can act on it. Spooling: SPOOL stands for simultaneous peripheral operation on-line. Spooling refers to storing jobs in a buffer so that CPU can be efficiently utilized. Spooling is useful because devices access data at different rates. The buffer provides a waiting station where data can rest while the slower device catches up. The most common spooling application is print spooling. In print spooling, documents are loaded into a buffer, and then the printer pulls them off from the buffer at its own rate. XIV. SECURITY MANAGEMENT Security in terms of a computer system covers every aspect of its protection in case of a catastrophic event, corruption of data, loss of confidentiality and so on. Security requires ample protection not only within the system, but also from the external environment, in which the system operates. Various security techniques employed by the operating system to secure the information are user authentication and backup of data. 1) User Authentication The process of authenticating users can be based on a user's possession like a key or card, user information like the username and password or user attributes like fingerprints and signature. Among these techniques, user information is often the first and most significant line of defence in a Page 92 multiuser system. Unfortunately, passwords can often be guessed, illegally transferred or exposed. To avoid such situations, a user should keep the following points in mind: 1) Password should be at least six characters in length. 2) The system should keep track of any event about any attempt to break the password. 3) The system should allow limited number of attempts for submitting a password on a particular system. 4) Password based on dictionary words should be discouraged by the system. Alphanumeric passwords, such as PASS011, should be used. 2) Backup of Data To backup is to copy files to a second medium (a disk or tape) as a precaution in case the first medium fails. One of the cardinal rules in using computers is back up your files regularly. Operating system should provide a feature of backing up of data, for example, from a disk to another storage device such as a floppy disk or an optical disk. The purpose of keeping backups is to be able to restore individual files or complete file system in case of data loss. 3) Data encryption Encryption is the conversion of data (called plaintext) into a form (called a cyphertext) that cannot be easily understood by unauthorised user. Before being able to understand the content of the data, the receiver must be in possession of an encryption key used to decrypt the cyphertext. XV. EXAMPLES OF OS XIII.1 Commonly used OS Some of the commonly used operating systems are discussed below: 1. DOS (Disk Operating System): MS- DOS was the widely used operating system before the introduction of the Windows operating system. Even now the MS- DOS commands are used for carrying out many jobs like copying the files, deleting the files etc. The main functions of DOS are to manage files, allocate system resources according to the requirement. It provides essential features to control hardware devices such a keyboard, screen, disk drives, printers, modems etc. 2. Windows: Microsoft launched Windows 1.0 operating system in 1985 and since then Windows has ruled the world’s software market. Various versions of Windows have been launched like Windows 95, 98, Win NT, XP, 7 and the latest being Windows 8. 3. Linux: Linux is a free and open software which means it is freely available for use and its source code is also available so anybody can use it, modify it and redistribute it. It is a very popular operating system used and supported by many companies. 4. MAC OS (Macintosh operating system): It is the operating system developed by Apple for Mac computers 5. BOSS (Bharat Operating System Solutions): This is an Indian distribution of GNU/Linux. It consists of Linux operating system kernel, office application suite, Bharateeya OO, Internet browser (Firefox), multimedia applications and file sharing. 6. UNIX: It is a multitasking, multiuser operating system originally developed in 1969 at Bell Labs. It was one of the first operating systems developed in a high level language, namely C. Due to its portability, flexibility and power, UNIX is widely being used in a networked environment. Page 93 7. Solaris: It is a free Unix based operating system introduced by Sun Microsystems in 1992. It is now also known as Oracle Solaris. XIII.2 Mobile Operating Systems (Mobile OS) It is the operating system that operates on digital mobile devices like smart phones and tablets. It extends the features of a normal operating system for personal computers so as to include touch screen, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS mobile navigation, camera, music player and many more. The most commonly used mobile operating systems are Android and Symbian Android: It is a Linux derived Mobile OS released on 5th November 2007 and by 2011 it had more than 50% of the global Smartphone market share. It is Google’s open and free software that includes an operating system, middleware and some key applications for use on mobile devices. Various versions of Android OS have been released like 1.0, 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, 3.0 etc. Symbian: This Mobile OS by Nokia designed for smartphones. It offers high level of functional integration between communication and personal information management. It has an integrated mail box and it completely facilitates the usage of all Google applications in your smartphone easily. Various versions like S60 series, S80 series, S90 series, Symbian Anna etc have been released. DATABASE The term database refers to a collection of related data from which the users can efficiently retrieve the desired information. In addition to the storage and retrieval of data, certain other operations can also be performed on a database. These operations include adding, updating and deleting data. All these operations on a database are performed using a database management system (DBMS). Essentially, a DBMS is a computerized record-keeping system. In this topic we will be introduced to the basic terminology used in a database management system (such as normalisation, entities, attributes, keys, relational database management systems, structured query language).

INTRODUCTION TO DATABASES I.1 Definition and examples A database can be summarily described as a repository for data. It is a collection of non redundant data which can be shared by different application systems. Although databases are generally computerized, instances of non-computerized (paper-based) databases from everyday life can be cited in abundance. A dictionary, a phone book, a collection of recipes and a TV guide are all common examples of non-computerized databases. The examples of computerized databases include customer files, search engines, books catalogue, equipment inventories and sales transactions. I.2 Computerized database vs non-computerized database Computerized database Can hold vast amount of data Paper-based database Very fast to find a specific record Limited by the physical space available Can take a while to manually search through all of the record Can easily search for a specific criteria e.g. “All the student who live in Ntarikon” Difficult to search for a specific criteria; every record wold have to be manually look at Data can be sorted into ascending or descending order on multiple criteria Difficult to sort data on more than one criteria The database can be kept secure by the use of password The only security will be locking up the record Can easily update or amend a record Changes have to be done manually. Record can look messy if scribbled out Easy to make a back-up in case of data lost Difficult to make a back-up because every page would have to be rewritten or photocopied I.3 Database terminologies I.3.1 Data and Information Data can be anything such as a number, a person's name, images, sounds and so on. Hence, data can be defined as a set of isolated and unrelated raw facts (represented by values), which have little or no meaning because they lack a context for evaluation (e.g. ‘Monica’, ‘36’, ‘chief’ …). When the data are processed and converted into a meaningful and useful form, it is known as information. Hence, information can be defined as a set of organized and validated collection of data. For example, 'Monica is 35 years old and she is a chef'. Strictly speaking, data refer to the values physically recorded in the database, whereas information refers to the conclusion or meaning drawn out of it. With respect to database, these terms are synonymous. I.3.2 Data validation Data validation is the process of ensuring that a program operates on clean, correct and useful data. It uses routines, often called "validation rules" "validation constraints" or "check routines", that check for correctness, meaningfulness, and security of data that are input to the system. I.3.3 Metadata Page 96 of 227 Metadata is literally "data about data." This term refers to information about data itself -- perhaps the origin, size, formatting or other characteristics of a data item. In the database field, metadata is essential to understanding and interpreting the contents of a data warehouse (central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources). I.3.4 Data Dictionary A data dictionary is a collection of descriptions of the data objects or items in a data model for the benefit of programmers and others who need to refer to them. When developing programs that use the data model, a data dictionary can be consulted to understand where a data item fits in the structure, what values it may contain, and basically what the data item means in real-world terms. I.3.5 Field, record, file In the structure of a database, the smallest component under which data is entered is the field. All fields in the same database have unique names, several data fields make up a record, several records make up a file, and several files make up a database. A File is a named collection of logically related multiple records. Depending on the database software, a table can also be referred to as a table. Example: in a database maintaining information about employee, - the fields can be Code, Deptt, Name, Address, City and Phone (see Figure 1). - - fields Code, Deptt, Name, Address, City and Phone for a particular employee form a record. Figure 1 contains five records (0101–0109) and each record has six fields. a collection of all the employee records of a company form employee table. Figure 1. Fields and Records in a Table XVII. DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS) A DBMS is a collection of programs that manages the database structure and controls access to the data stored in the database. The DBMS serves as the intermediary between the end user and the database by translating user requests into the complex computer code. The end user interacts with the DBMS through an application program. Page 97 of 227 Data Model: A data model is a representation of a real world situation about which data is to be collected and stored in a database. A data model depicts the dataflow and logical interrelationships among different data elements. Database system: Database system is a general term that refers to the combination of a database, a DBMS and a data model. A database system consists of Data (the database), Software, Hardware and Users. It allows users to Store, Update, Retrieve, Organise and Protect their data. Figure 2: a database system Some DBMS examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access, SQL Server, FileMaker, Oracle, RDBMS, dBASE, Clipper, and FoxPro. XVIII. DATABASE MODELS A data model is a collection of concepts and rules for the description of the structure of the database. Structure of the database means the data types, the constraints and the relationships for the description or storage of data respectively. Database models may be grouped into two categories: • conceptual model focuses on the logical nature of the data representation and is concerned with what is represented in the database; conceptual model include Entity-Relationship (ER) Model and Object-Oriented (OO) Model • Implementation model emphases on how information is represented in the database or on how the data structures are implemented to represent what is modelled. Implementation models include the hierarchical database model, the network database model, and the relational database model. III.1 Hierarchical Database Model The hierarchical data model organizes the data in a tree-like structure. Each child node (also known as dependents) can have only one parent node. The main advantage of the hierarchical data model is that the data access is quite Page 98 of 227 Figure 3 : The hierachical database model predictable in structure, and therefore, both retrieval and updates can be highly optimized by a DBMS. However, the main drawback of this model is that the links are 'hard coded' into the data structure, that is, the links are permanently established and cannot be modified. III.2 Network Database Model Using records and sets, this model uses a one-to many relationship approach for the data records. Multiple branches are allocated for lower-level structures and branches that are then connected by multiple nodes, which represent higher-level structures within the information. This database modelling method provides an efficient way to retrieve information and organize the data so that it can be looked at multiple ways, providing a means of increasing business performance and reaction time. This is a viable model for planning road, train, or utility networks, but it is difficult to alter the database because information entered can alter the entire database. Figure 4 : The Network database model III.3 Relational Database The relational data model represents the database as a collection of simple two-dimensional tables called relations. The rows of a relation are referred to as tupples and the columns are referred to as attributes. Fig 5: a relational database III.4 Object-oriented Database Model The object-oriented model is a relatively new data model and provides an outlook for the future database models. An object-oriented database stores and maintains objects. An object is an item that can contain both the data and the procedures that manipulate the data. For example, a student object might contain not only data about a student's name, roll number and address, but also procedures on some tasks such as printing the student record or calculating the student's tuition fees. Like the other models, the object model assumes that objects can conceptually be collected together into meaningful groups known as classes. Page 99 of 227 III.5: Object Relational Model: These models have created an entirely new type of database, which combines database design with application program to solve specific technical problems while leveraging the best of both worlds. To date, object databases still need to be refined to achieve greater standardization. Real world applications of this model often include technical or scientific fields, such as engineering and molecular biology. XIX. DATA BASE ABSTRACTION LEVELS Three – level architecture for database system is proposed to archive the characteristics of the database approach. The goal of this architecture is separate the applications and the physical database so the actual details of how data is organized are hided from the users. Fig ure 6: Th ree- lev el dat aba se Arc hit ect ure 1) E xte rna l level or view: View level part may be considered the "who" part of the picture. In this highest level, there exists a number of views which of is defined a part of the actual database. Each view is provided for a user or a group of users so that it helps in simplified the interaction between the user and system. 2) Conceptual (logical) level: At conceptual level, the emphasis lies on the "what" part of the picture. It describes the logical structure of the whole database. The entire database is described using simple logical concepts such as objects, their properties or relationships. Thus the complexity of the implementation detail of the data with be hided from the users (abstraction). Page 100 of 227 3) Internal (physical) level: Physical level emphasizes the "how" and "where" parts of the data storage. It describes where the data is actually stored, how is it stored and how to access it. XX. DATABASE USERS A database user is a principal at the database level. Every database user is a member of the public role. End user: People whose jobs require access to database for querying, updating and generating report. Application developer: Write software to allow end users to interface with the database system. This kind of user need to familiar with the DBMSs to accomplish their task. Database systems programmer: Writes the database software itself Database Administrator (DBA): A person or a group of people who is responsible for designing & managing the database system. i.e. authorizing the access to the database, monitoring its use and managing all the resource to support the use of the whole database system XXI. CENTRLIZED DATABASE vs DISTRIBUTED DATABASE VI.1 Centralized database: In a centralized database, all the data of an organization is stored in a single place such as a mainframe computer or a server. Users in remote locations access the data through the Wide Area Network (WAN) using the application programs provided to access the data. The centralized database (the mainframe or the server) should be able to satisfy all the requests coming to the system, therefore could easily become a bottleneck. But since all the data reside in a single place it easier to maintain and back up data. Furthermore, it is easier to maintain data integrity, because once data is stored in a centralized database, outdated data is no longer available in other places Figure 7 : A centralized database VI.2 Distributed database A distributed database is a database that consists of two or more files located at different sites on a computer network. Because the database is distributed, different users can access it without interfering with one another in a transparent manner. Users Page 101 of 227 Figure 8 : A distributed database access the data in a distributed database by accessing the WAN, but the user has the impression that the access of data is done on his local machine. To keep a distributed database up to date, it uses the replication and duplication processes. XXII. ENTITY-RELATION MODEL The conceptual model can be represented using Entity-Relationship model (E-R model). The E-R model views the real world as a set of basic objects (known as entities), their characteristics (known as attributes) and associations among these objects (known as relationships). VII.1 Entity, Attributes and relationship 1) An entity is any object in the system that we want to model and store information about. Entities are usually recognizable concepts, either concrete or abstract, such as person, places, things, or events which have relevance to the database. 2) An attribute is an item of information which is stored about an entity. There exist different types of entity (a) Simple and composite attributes. A simple attribute is the smallest semantic unit of data, which are atomic (no internal structure). A composite attribute can be subdivided into parts, e.g., address (street, city, state, zip). (b) Single and multivalued attributes. Single attributes have a single value for a particular entity. Multivalued attributes have multiple values of an attribute for a particular entity; e.g., degrees or courses that a student can have or take. 3) Relationship is an association, dependency or link between two or more. Example. In a business enterprise, entity may be Product, Representative and Customer. The attributes of product can be Name and Price. The attribute of representative is Name, Region and Phone. The attributes of Customer are Name, City and Age. The relationship between customer and product is represented by “Buys”, and the relationship between Representative and product is represented by “Sells” Figure 9: Entity, attribute and relationship Page 102 of 227 VII.2 Entity-Relationship diagram (ERD) An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is a graphical representation of entities and their relationships. Region Name Representative • Rectangles represent entity types • Ellipses represent attributes • Diamonds represent relationship types Price Phone Name Sels Product Figure 10. Entities, Attributes and Relationship • Lines link attributes to entity types and entity types to relationship types • Primary key attributes are underlined VII.3 Types of Relationship Name Buys Date Customer City Age Even though a relationship may involve more than two entities, the most commonly encountered relationships are binary, involving exactly two entities. Generally, such binary relationships are of three types and called cardinality: one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many. a) One-to-one Relationship (1:1) One-to-one relationships occur when each entry in the first table has one, and only one, counterpart in the second table. One-to-one relationships are rarely used because it is often more efficient to simply put all of the information in a single table. eg if a man only marries one woman and a woman only marries one man, it is a one-to-one (1:1) relationship. Fig 5 : One-to-One b) One-to-many Relationship (1:M) One-to-many relationships are the most common type of database relationship. They occur when each record in the first table corresponds to one or more records in the second table but each record in the second table corresponds to only one record in the first table. For example, the relationship between a Teachers table and a Students table in an elementary school Page 103 of 227 database would likely be a one-to-many relationship, because each student has only one teacher, but each teacher may have multiple students. Fig 6: One-to-Many The crowbar represents the Many occurrence. c) Many-to-many Relationship (M:M) Many-to-many relationships occur when each record in the first table corresponds to one or more records in the second table and each record in the second table corresponds to one or more records in the first table. For example, One teacher teaches many students and a student is taught by many teachers. Fig 7 Many-to-Many relationship XXIII. RELATIONAL DATABASE The relational database model is used in most of today's commercial databases. It is used since the early 80ies and was developed 1970 by E. F. Codd. The relational database model is based on a mathematical concept where relations are interpreted as tables. VIII.1 Concept of the relational model In contrast to the entity-relationship-model (ERM) which is a conceptual data model, the relational model is a logical data model. The relational model is not about abstract objects but defines how data should be represented in a specific database management system. The goal of a logical data model is to arrange the data in such a form that it is consistent, non-redundant and supports operations for data manipulation. The main organization unit in a relational data model is the relation. A relation can be represented as a table but the definition of the relation is not necessarily equal to the definition of the table and vice versa. VIII.2 Relational model terminologies The terminologies used in relational model are quite different from the one used in ERM. The table below shows some terms used in relational model ER Model Relational Model Database Entity Relation Traditional Programmer Table File Page 104 of 227 Entity Instance Tuple Row Attribute Attribute Record Column Identifier Key Key Field VIII.3 Database Keys Key (or link) Keys are, as their name suggests, a key part of a relational database and a vital part of the structure of a table. They ensure each record within a table can be uniquely identified by one or a combination of fields within the table. They help enforce integrity and help identify the relationship between tables. There are three main types of keys, candidate keys, primary keys and foreign keys. There is also an alternative key or secondary key that can be used, as the name suggests, as a secondary or alternative key to the primary key d) Super Key A Super key is any combination of fields within a table that uniquely identifies each record within that table. e) Candidate key In a table, there can be more than one field that can uniquely identify each record. All such fields are known as candidate keys. One of these candidate keys is chosen as a primary key; the other keys that are not chosen as primary key are known as alternate keys or secondary keys. f) Primary Key: A field or a set of fields that uniquely identify each record in a table is known as a primary key. This implies that no two records in the relation can have same value for the primary key. For example, an employee number uniquely identifies a member of staff within a company. An IP address uniquely addresses a PC on the internet. A primary key is mandatory. That is, each entity occurrence must have a value for its primary key. g) Foreign Key: A field of a table that references the primary key of another table is referred to as foreign key. Figure 13.3 illustrates how a foreign key constraint is related to a primary key constraint. Here, the field Item_Code in the PURCHASE table references the field Item_Code in the ITEM relation. Thus, the attribute Item_Code in the PURCHASE relation is the foreign key. Page 105 of 227 Figure 8. Foreign Key h) Simple Key Any of the keys described before (ie: primary, secondary or foreign) may have one or more attributes. A simple key consists of a single attribute to uniquely identify an entity occurrence. i) Compound Key A compound key consists of more than one attribute to uniquely identify an entity occurrence. Each attribute, which makes up the key, is also a simple key in its own right. For example, we have an entity named enrolment, which holds the courses on which a student is enrolled. In this scenario a student is allowed to enrol on more than one course. This has a compound key of both student number and course number, which is required to uniquely identify a student on a particular course. Fig 9: a compound key Student number and course number combined is a compound primary key for the enrolment entity. j) Composite Key A composite key consists of more than one attribute to uniquely identify an entity occurrence. This differs from a compound key in that one or more of the attributes, which make up the key, are not simple keys in their own right. For example, you have a database holding your CD collection. One of the entities is called tracks, which holds details of the tracks on a CD. This has a composite key of CD name, track number. Page 106 of 227 Fig 10: a composite key CD name in the track entity is a simple key, linking to the CD entity, but track number is not a simple key in its own right. Application exercise For each of the following entities, list possible primary keys. Then, suggest secondary keys, if any: Student, Course, Unit, Result, Classroom, Lecturer, Department, and Attendance VIII.3 Transforming an ERM to a relational model scheme VIII.3.1 Entity to Relation Conversion  General steps: - Entities – In general, each entity will be converted directly to a relation. - - - The attributes of the entity become the attributes of the Relation. The Identifier of the Entity becomes a Key of the Relation. Relationships will be mapped as “Foreign Keys”. There are a number of variations to this step that will be described in more details below. – One to Many (1:M) To represent a 1:M relationship, take the primary key of the parent table (on the “1” side) and insert it as a foreign key into the child table (on the “M” side). It may make sense to rename the foreign key to reflect its relationship to the table you are inserting it into. V III.3. 2 Repr esent ing Rela tions hips Page 107 of 227 VIII.3.3 Representing Relationships – Many to Many There is no direct representation of a M:N relationship in the relational model. You will need to turn each M:N relationship between two entities into a separate relation (table) of its own. This relation will usually have as its own primary key the combination of two foreign keys – each of these will be the primary key of one of the relations involved in this relationship. VIII.3.4 Representing Relationships – One to One The key or one relation is stored in the second relation. NB: If a relatio nship has attribu tes then they need to go into a table. Where to put them depends on the type of the relationship. In a 1:1 or 1:M Page 108 of 227 relationship, put them the same place the foreign key goes (on the M side in 1:M). In a M:N relationship, put them in the new table you create for the relationship. XXIV. DATA INTEGRITY Data integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency of stored data, indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data record. The concept of data integrity ensures that all data in a database can be traced and connected to other data. This ensures that everything is recoverable and searchable. Having a single, well-defined and well-controlled data integrity system increases stability, performance, reusability and maintainability. The following three integrity constraints are used in a relational database structure to achieve data integrity:  Entity Integrity: The rule states that every table must have its own primary key and that each has to be unique and not null.  Referential Integrity: This is the concept of foreign keys. The rule states that the foreign key value can be in two states. The first state is that the foreign key value would refer to a primary key value of another table, or it can be null.  Domain Integrity: This states that all columns in a relational database are in a defined domain. XXV. DATABASE NORMALIZATION Normalization is a process in which data attributes within a data model are organized to increase the cohesion of entity types. In other words, the goal of data normalization is to reduce and even eliminate data redundancy, an important consideration for application developers. There are two goals of the normalization process: • eliminating redundant data (for example, storing the same data in more than one table ) and • ensuring data dependencies make sense (only storing related data in a table). Both of these are worthy goals as they reduce the amount of space a database consumes and ensure that data is logically stored. X.1 Dependencies In order to be able to normalise a relation, we must first understand the concept of dependency between attributes within a relation. There exist various types of dependencies: 1) Functional dependency: If A and B are attributes of relation R, B is functionally dependent on A (denoted A --> B), if each value of A in R is associated with exactly one value of B in R. 2) Full functional dependency: We talk about full functional dependency if attribute B is functional dependent on A, if A is a composite primary key and B is not already functional dependent on parts of A. 3) Transitive dependency: If A determines B and B determines C then C is determined by (dependent on) A. We write A --> B and B --> C then A --> C. Page 109 of 227 Examples. Let’s consider the following relation X.2 The Normal Forms The database community has developed a series of guidelines for ensuring that databases are normalized. These are referred to as normal forms and are numbered from one (the lowest form of normalization, referred to as first normal form or 1NF) through five (fifth normal form or 5NF). In practical applications, you'll often see 1NF , 2NF , and 3NF along with the occasional 4NF. Fifth normal form is very rarely seen and won't be discussed in this article. X.2.1 First normal form (1NF) A table is in first normal form (1NF) if a relation cannot have repeating fields or groups (no field must have more than one value): To do it, we have to: a) Eliminate duplicative columns from the same table. b) Create separate tables for each group of related data and identify each row with a unique column or set of columns (the primary key). Example Let’s consider the following relation: Students(Surname, LastName, Knowledge) The attribute Knowledge can contain multiple values and therefore the relation is not in the first normal form. To get to the first normal form (1NF) we must create a separate tuple for each value of the multivalued attribute X.2.2 Second normal form (2NF) A table is 2NF when it is in 1NF and when all of its non-key attributes are fully dependent on its primary key (no partial dependency). That is, if X → A holds, then there should not be any proper subset Y of X, for that Y → A also holds. To do it, we should: a) Remove subsets of data that apply to multiple rows of a table and place them in separate tables. Page 110 of 227 b) Create relationships between these new tables and their predecessors through the use of foreign keys. Example : Let’s consider the following relation: We see here in Student_Project relation that the primiry key attributes are Stu_ID and Proj_ID. According to the rule, non-key attributes, i.e. Stu_Name and Proj_Name must be dependent upon both and not on any of the prime key attribute individually. But we find that Stu_Name can be identified by Stu_ID and Proj_Name can be identified by Proj_ID independently. This is called partial dependency, which is not allowed in Second Normal Form. So to put the table into 2NF, We broke the relation in two as depicted in the above picture. So there exists no partial dependency. X.2.3 Third normal form (3NF) A table is in third normal form (3NF) if it is in 2NF and there is no transitive dependency, that is, an attribute depends on one or more other non-key attributes. Third normal form (3NF) goes one large step further:  Meet all the requirements of the second normal form.  Remove columns that are not dependent upon the primary key. Example: Let’s consider the following student_detail relation We find that in above depicted Student_detail relation, Stu_ID is key and the only primary key attribute. We find that City can be identified by Stu_ID as well as Zip itself. Additionally, Stu_ID → Zip → City, so there exists transitive dependency. We broke the relation as above depicted two relations to bring it into 3NF X.2.4 Boyce-Codd Normal Form BCNF is an extension of Third Normal Form in strict way. it referred to as the "third and half (3.5) normal form", since it adds one more requirement:  Meet all the requirements of the third normal form.  Every determinant must be a candidate key. X.2.5 Fourth normal form (4NF) Finally, fourth normal form (4NF) has one additional requirement:  Meet all the requirements of the third normal form. Page 111 of 227  A relation is in 4NF if it has no multi-valued dependencies. Multivalued dependencies occur when the presence of one or more rows in a table implies the presence of one or more other rows in that same table. In practice we rarely need to apply the 4NF to a database. XXVI. INTRODUCTION TO QUERIES A database query is used to extract data from the database in a readable format according to the user's request. For instance, if you have an employee table, you might issue a SQL statement that returns the employee who is paid the most. This request to the database for usable employee information is a typical query that can be performed in a relational database. The most known and most used query language is SQL (Structured Query Language). XI.1 Introduction to SQL SQL (Structured Query Language) is a database query language developed by IBM in the 1970s as a way of getting information into and out of relational DBMSs. A fundamental difference between SQL and standard programming languages is that SQL is declarative, that is, the user has to specify what kind of data are required from the database and the RDBMS is responsible for figuring out the way to retrieve it. XI.2 Basic operations in a RDB In a relational database, three basic operations are used to develop useful sets of data: selection, projection and join.  The selection (𝝈) operation retrieves certain records from a relation based on the user specified criteria.  The projection (𝚷) operation extracts fields from a relation, permitting the user to create new relations that contain only the required information.  The join operation combines the data from the two relations based on a common column, providing the user with more information than is available in individual relations. Together, these three operations are part of relational algebra. XI.3 SQL Data Types When the table is defined every field in it is assigned a data type. The type of a data value both defines and constrains the kinds of operations, which may be performed on it. Some of the most commonly used SQL data types are as follows: • CHAR(size): It defines a fixed size-length character string (can contain letters, numbers and special characters), where size can be a maximum of 255. • VARCHAR(size): It defines a variable length character string (can contain letters, numbers and special characters) of up to size characters. • NUMBER(size): It defines an integer-type data with maximum number of digits up to size specified in parenthesis. • DATE: It is used to store date. By default, the format is YYYY-MM-DD. Page 112 of 227 • NUMBER(size, decimal): It holds numbers with fractions. The maximum numbers of digits are specified in size. The maximum number of digits to the right of the decimal is specified in decimal. XI.4 SQL Basic Commands SQL commands can be divided into two main sublanguages: DDL and DML • Data Definition Language: DDL is used to create and delete database and its objects. These commands are primarily used by the DBA during the building and removal phases of a database project. The most important DDL statements in SQL are as follows: - CREATE TABLE: To create a new table. - - ALTER TABLE: To modify the structure of a table. DROP TABLE: To delete a table. • Data Manipulation Language: DML is used to retrieve, insert, modify and delete database information. These commands will be used by all database users during the routine operation of the database. The most important DML statements in SQL are the following: - INSERT: To insert data into a table. - - - UPDATE: To update data in a table. DELETE: To delete data from a table. SELECT: To retrieve data from a table. NOTE: All SQL queries must be terminated by a semicolon (;) even if the statement extends over many lines. XI.4.1 CREATE TABLE Command The CREATE TABLE command is used to define the structure of the table. Syntax: Example: CREATE TABLE ( , < field2> , ... ... ... ... ... < fieldN> ); CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE( Code NUMBER(5), Deptt CHAR(10), Name CHAR(20), Address CHAR(100), Telephone CHAR(8) Salary NUMBER(8,2)); • The table and column names must start with a letter followed by letters, numbers or underscores. • Avoid using SQL keywords as names for tables or columns (such as SELECT, CREATE, and INSERT). • For each column, a name and a data type must be specified and the column name must be unique within the table definition. • Each column definition should be separated with a comma. XI.4.2 ALTER TABLE Command The ALTER TABLE command allows a user to change the structure of an existing table. Page 113 of 227 • New columns can be added with the ADD clause. • Existing columns can be modified with the MODIFY clause. • Columns can be removed from a table by using the DROP clause. Syntax: ALTER TABLE ; Examples: Explanation 1 ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE ADD Email CHAR(25); command will add a new column, named Email, having a maximum width of 25 characters in the EMPLOYEE table. 2 ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE MODIFY Name CHAR(25); command will change the maximum width of the Name column to 25 characters in the EMPLOYEE table. 3 ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE DROP Deptt; command will delete the Deptt column from the EMPLOYEE table. XI.4.3 DROP TABLE Command The DROP TABLE command removes the table definition (with all records). • Columns can be removed from a table by using the DROP clause. Syntax: DROP TABLE ; Examples: DROP TABLE EMPLOYEE; The above SQL command will delete the EMPLOYEE table. XI.4.4 INSERT Command The INSERT command is used to insert or add rows (records) into the specified table. Syntax: INSERT INTO ( column1, column2, ..., columnN) VALUES (value1, value2, ..., valueN); Examples Explanation 1 INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE ( Code, Deptt, Name, Address, Salary) VALUES (101, 'RD01', 'Prince', 'Park Way', 15000); example 1 will add a new record at the bottom of the EMPLOYEE table consisting of the values in parenthesis. 2 INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES (102, 'RD01', 'Pankaj', 'Pitampura', 26062700, 8000); Note that for each of the listed columns, a matching value must be specified. In case no column list is specified, then a value must be given for each column and in the same order as specified in the CREATE TABLE command. XI.4.5 UPDATE Command The UPDATE command is used for modifying attribute values of records in a table. Syntax: Page 114 of 227 UPDATE SET column1 = value1 [, column2 = value2] ... ... ... ... ... [, columnN = valueN] [WHERE ]; Note that components specified inside the square brackets [] are optional. Examples Explanation 1 UPDATE EMPLOYEE SET Salary = Salary + 1000; example 1 command will update (in our case, increments) the Salary field with 1000 for all the records. 2 UPDATE EMPLOYEE SET Salary = Salary + 1000 WHERE Deptt = 'RD01'; Example 2 command will increment the Salary column with 1000 for only those rows that comply with condition specified in WHERE clause (Deptt = 'RD01'). XI.4.6 DELETE Command The DELETE command is used to delete all or selected records from the specified table. Syntax: Example: DELETE FROM [WHERE ]; DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Salary > 8000; NOTE: If WHERE condition is not used in the DELETE command, then all the records from the specified table will be deleted. XI.4.7 SELECT command The SELECT statement is used to query the database and retrieve selected data. Syntax: SELECT FROM [WHERE ] [GROUP BY ] [HAVING ] [ORDER BY ]; To select all the columns of a table, use * instead of column list with SELECT. Examples Explanation 1 SELECT Code, Name, Salary FROM EMPLOYEE; The SELECT statement selects the values of the three specified columns from the EMPLOYEE table. This operation is called projection. 2 SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Salary > 7500; The SELECT statement selects all those columns from EMPLOYEE table in which the Salary column contains a value greater than 7500. This operation is called selection. SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Salary > 7500 the SELECT statement displays the result in a descending order by the attribute Name. Page 115 of 227 ORDER BY Name DESC; The ORDER BY clause specifies a sorting order in which the result tuples of a query are to be displayed; DESC specifies a descending order. By default, ORDER BY arranges the result set in ascending order (whether one uses ASC or not). XI.5 SQL Joins The SQL Joins clause is used to combine records from two or more tables in a database. A JOIN is a means for combining fields from two tables by using values common to each. Consider the following two tables, (a) CUSTOMERS table is as follows: (a) CUSTOMERS (b) ORDERS ID Name Age Address Salary 1 Ramesh 32 Ahmedabad 2000 2 Khilan 25 Dehli 1500 Oid Date Cust_id Amount 102 2009-10-08 3 3000 100 2009-10-08 3 3 kaushik 23 Chaitali 2000 1500 101 2009-11-20 2 4 Chaitali 25 Mumbai 6500 1560 103 2008-05-20 4 5 Hardik 27 Bhopal 6 Komal 22 MP 8500 4500 7 Muffy 24 Indore 10000 Now, let us join these two tables in our SELECT statement as follows: Query 2060 This would produce the following result: ID Name SELECT ID, Name, Age, Amount FROM CUSTOMERS, ORDERS WHERE Age 3 kaushik Amount 23 CUSTOMERS.ID = 3 kaushik 3000 23 ORDERS.CUST_ID; 1500 2 Khilan 25 4 Chaitali 1560 25 2060 Here, it is noticeable that the join is performed in the WHERE clause. Several operators can be used to join tables, such as =, <, >, <>, <=, >=, !=, BETWEEN, LIKE, and NOT; they can all be used to join tables. However, the most common operator is the equal symbol. QUERRY APPLICATION 1) The table E (for EMPLOYEE) Query Solution nr name salary 1 John 100 5 Sarah 300 7 Tom 100 Query Solution select salary from E salary 100 select nr, salary from E nr salary 1 100 Page 116 of 227 Page 117 of 227 300 5 300 7 100 select * from E where salary < 200 nr name salary 1 John 100 7 Tom 100 select * from E where salary < 200 and nr >= 7 nr name salary 7 Tom 100 select name, salary from E where salary < 200 name salary John 100 Tom 100 2) Cartesian product: The table E (for EMPLOYEE) The table D (for DEPARTMENT) enr ename dept 1 Bill A 2 Sarah C 3 John A dnr dname A Marketing B Sales C Legal Query Solution Query Solution select * from E, D enr ename dept dnr dname 1 Bill A A Marketing 1 Bill A B Sales 1 Bill A C Legal 2 Sarah C A Marketing 2 Sarah C B Sales 2 Sarah C C Legal 3 John A A Marketing 3 John A B Sales 3 John A C Legal select * from E, D where dept = dnr enr ename dept dnr dname 1 Bill A A Marketing 2 Sarah C C Legal 3 John A A Marketing 3) Natural join The table E (for EMPLOYEE) The table D (for DEPARTMENT) nr name dept 1 Bill A 2 Sarah C 3 John A nr name A Marketing B Sales C Legal Query Solution select * from E as E(enr, ename, dept), D as D(dnr, dname) enr ename dept dnr dname 1 Bill A A Marketing where dept = dnr 2 Sarah C C Legal 3 John A A Marketing select * from E, D where dept = D.nr nr name dept nr name 1 Bill A A Marketing 2 Sarah C C Legal 3 John A A Marketing Page 118 of 227 DATA COMMUNICATION AND COMPUTER NETWORK Contents I.

BASIC NETWORKING CONCEPTS I.1- Definition and Network Basics Networking is the concept of sharing resources and services. A network is a set of interconnected objects (roads, computers, …) with something to share. A computer network is therefore a group of interconnected computer systems sharing resources and interacting using a shared communications link. All networks must have the following: - - - A resource to share (resource) A pathway to transfer data (transmission medium) A set of rules governing how to communicate (protocols) I.2- BENEFITS OF COMPUTER NETWORK Specifically, networks are about sharing three things: information, resources, and applications.  Sharing information: networks allow users to communicate with each other in various ways: email, chat, forums, etc.  Sharing resources: Certain computer resources, such as printers or hard drives, can be set up so that network users can share them. Sharing hard drives involves also sharing of files and folders. A network can be used to share an Internet connection.  Sharing applications: several users can work together on a single business application. Apart from sharing, other benefits of a computer network are:  Flexible Access: Networks allow their users to access files from computers throughout the network.  Reducing of cost: Instead of buying a printer for each computer of a big network, a single printer can be shared, and then cost is considerably reduced I.3- DOWNSIDES (SHORTCOMMINGS) OF NETWORKING Although networks are one of the best things that ever happened to computers, not everything about networks is rosy. The following sections describe some disadvantages of using a network:  Viruses: If a virus is introduced to the network, either intentionally or unintentionally, it will rapidly spread around all of the workstations and could start to cause havoc to peoples' files or to the efficient working of the network.  Network failure: If the file server fails then no-one on the network can access any files or folders. This means that nobody can do any work. For an organization, this would be extremely costly and disruptive.  Slow service: As more users log onto the network and request files, send things to be printed and open more software applications, the network can start to slow down.  Cost: Building a network isn't cheap. I.4- Networking hardware Networking hardware includes all computers, peripherals, interface cards and other equipment needed to perform data-processing and communications within the network. Some examples of networking hardware are: File Servers, Workstations, Network Interface Cards, Hubs, Switches, Repeaters, Bridges, and Routers: 1  Workstations: Each user computers connected to a network is called workstations. A typical workstation is a computer that is configured with a network interface card, networking software, and the appropriate cables.  Network Interface Cards(NIC): It is an internal device that provides the physical connection between the network and the computer workstation.  Hub: In general, a hub refers to a hardware device that enables multiple devices or connections to be connected to a computer. It is the most basic networking device that connects multiple computers or other network devices together.  Switch: It is a hardware device that filters and forwards packets through the network, but often not capable of much more. Switches (or concentrators) work the same way as hubs, but they can identify the intended destination of the information that they receive, so they send that information to only the computers that are supposed to receive it.  Repeaters: Since a signal loses strength as it passes along a cable, it is often necessary to boost the signal with a device called a repeater. The repeater electrically amplifies the signal it receives and rebroadcasts it.  Bridges: A bridge is a device that allows you to segment a large network into two smaller, more efficient networks. The bridge manages the traffic to maintain optimum performance on both sides of the network. Bridges must be used between networks with the same protocol.  Routers: A router is a device that forwards data packets between computer networks, creating an overlay internetwork. A router has a lot more capabilities than other network devices such as a hub or a switch that are only able to perform basic network functions.  Gateway: A gateway is a network point that acts as an entrance to another network. When a computer server serves as a Gateway node, the gateway node also operates as a firewall and a proxy server.  Firewall: A software utility or hardware device that limits outside network access to a computer or local network by blocking or restricting ports. Firewalls are a great step for helping prevent un authorized access to a company or home network.  Modem: The Modem is a hardware device that enables a computer to send and receive information over telephone lines by converting the digital data used by your computer into an analog signal used on phone lines (modulation) and then converting it back once received on the other end (demodulation).  Proxy: A proxy is a computer server or software program that is part of the gateway server or another computer that separates a local network from outside networks. A proxy server will cache all pages accessed through the network allowing users who may wish to visit that same page to load it faster and reduce the networks bandwidth. II. CLASSIFICATION OF COMPUTER NETWORK Computer networks can be classify in different ways: according to the geographical area covered, the strategy used or type of connection II.1 ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF CONNECTION According to the type of connection, there exist two types of connections. Wired connection and wireless connection II.1.1 Wired connection 2 A wired network is when you physically connect your computer or other compatible device to your Super Hub with an Ethernet cable. The best thing about a wired connection is the reliability and speed it gives you (wired is faster than wireless). This makes it ideal for things that use a lot of bandwidth, like playing online games on your Xbox. II.1.2 Wireless connection A wireless network, as its name would suggest, is a network of computers and computer peripherals that are connected to each other without wires. Advantages  It is easier to add or move workstations.  It is easier to provide connectivity in areas where it is difficult to lay cable.  Installation is fast and easy, and it can eliminate the need to pull cable through walls and ceilings.  Access to the network can be from anywhere within range of an access point. Disadvantages  As the number of computers using the network increases, the data transfer rate to each computer will decrease accordingly.  As standards change, it may be necessary to replace wireless cards and/or access points.  Security is more difficult to guarantee and requires configuration.  Devices will only operate at a limited distance from an access point. II.2 ACCORDING TO THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA COVERED According to the geographical area covered, there exist three main types of network: LAN, MAN and WAN II.2.1 Local Area Network (LAN) A LAN is a computer network that spans only a small geographical area such as an office, home building or closed buildings. A LAN is useful to share resources like files, printers, games and other application. The infrastructure in a LAN is private. The distance between computers in a LAN cannot be more than 15 Km. Ex: A school network II.2.2 Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) A MAN is a network of computers spread over a city or closed cities. It may be a single network such as a cable television network, or it may be many LANS connected together. A MAN may be operated by one organization (with several offices in one city) or be shared and used by several organizations in the same city. It can be either a private network or a public network. Ex: A network of all the agencies of CAMCCUL in Bamenda II.2.3 Wide Area Network (WAN) A WAN is a system of interconnecting many computer over a large geographical area such as states, countries or even the whole world. These kind of networks use telephone lines, satellite link and other long-range communication technologies to connect. Such networks are design to serve an area of hundreds kilometres such as national telephone network. For instance a company like Express Union with agencies at Fundong, Bamenda, Douala, Bafoussam, Yaoundé use a WAN to connect all its agencies. Although a WAN may be owned or rented by private business, it is usually a public network, designed to connect LANs or MANs together. The most known and the largest WAN is Internet. II.3 ACCORDING TO THE STRATEGY USED 3 According to the strategy used there exist two main types of network: Client/Server network and Peer to Peer (P2P) network: II.3.1 Client/server networks Computers that perform a service on behalf of other network devices are called servers. There are several types of servers. For example, a computer that provides other network nodes with access to network storage devices is called a file server. Print servers provide other network nodes with access to network printers. Computers that use the services of a server are called clients. Networks in which servers control access to network storage and other network resources are called client/server networks. In a Client/server network, the role of the server is to provide services demanded by client computers II.3.2 Peer-to-peer networks Computers that perform similar functions on a network are called peers. Networks in which no single, centralized computer controls network functions are called peer-to-peer networks. The idea of peer-to peer networking is that each computer on the network can be both a server and a client. Since any computer on the network can share a resource for other to use. Users can configure their computers so that they can share directories or printers with other users on the network. All computers are considered to have equal, or peer, status. II.3.3 Comparison between Peer to Peer network and Client/Server network Strategy Advantages Disadvantages Client/Server · Heavy processing power can be localized when needed. · Overall installation costs are less than a hierarchical network. · Servers provide clients with access to shared printers, network storage (including sharedapplications), network security features, and other network resources. · Administrative tasks not entirely centralized. · Expensive to add nodes. P2P · Relatively inexpensive to implement, can often be implemented on existing equipment. · Potentially, all resources can be made available over a network. · Processing power can be localized to the point of need. · Decentralized administration. · Security can be difficult to control III. NETWORK TOPOLOGIES Network topology is the layout pattern of interconnections of the various elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a computer network. Network topologies may be physical or logical. Physical topology means the physical design of a network including the devices, location and cable installation. Logical topology refers to how data is actually transferred in a network as opposed to its physical design. Topology can be considered as a virtual shape or structure of a network, for it not correspond to the actual physical design of the devices on the computer network. The computers on a home network can be arranged in a circle but it does not necessarily mean that it represents a ring topology. III.1 Physical Topology It is the physical configuration of a network that determines how the network's computers are connected. Common configurations include the bus 4 topology, mesh topology, ring topology, star topology, tree topology and hybrid topology. III.1.1- Bus Topology Bus Topology is the simplest of network topologies. In this type of topology, all the nodes (computers as well as servers) are connected to the single cable, by the help of interface connectors. This central cable is the backbone of the network and is known as Bus. Every workstation communicates with the other device through this Bus. A signal from the source is broadcasted and it travels to all workstations connected to bus cable. Although the message is broadcasted but only the intended recipient, whose MAC address or IP address matches, accepts it. A terminator is added at ends of the central cable, to prevent bouncing of signals. A barrel connector can be used to extend it. Advantages (benefits) of Linear Bus Topology 1) It is easy to set-up and extend bus network. 2) Cable length required for this topology is the least compared to other networks. 3) Bus topology costs very less. 4) Linear Bus network is mostly used in small networks. Good for LAN. Disadvantages (Drawbacks) of Linear Bus Topology 1) There is a limit on central cable length and number of nodes that can be connected. 2) Dependency on central cable in this topology has its disadvantages. If the main cable (i.e. bus) encounters some problem, whole network breaks down. 3) It is difficult to detect and troubleshoot fault at individual station. 4) Maintenance costs can get higher with time. 5) Efficiency of Bus network reduces, as the number of devices connected to it increases. 6) It is not suitable for networks with heavy traffic. 7) Security is very low because all the computers receive the sent signal from the source. III.2- Ring Topology In Ring Topology, all the nodes are connected to each-other in such a way that they make a closed loop. Each workstation is connected to two other components on either side, and it communicates with these two adjacent neighbors. Data travels around the network, in one direction. Sending and receiving of data takes place by the help of TOKEN. Token contains a piece of information which along with data is sent by the source computer. Advantages of Ring Topology 1) This type of network topology is very organized. Each node gets to send the data when it receives an empty token. This helps to reduces chances of collision. 2) Even when the load on the network increases, its performance is better than that of Bus topology. 3) There is no need for network server to control the connectivity between workstations. 4) Additional components do not affect the performance of network. 5) Each computer has equal access to resources. Disadvantages of Ring Topology 1) Each packet of data must pass through all the computers between source and destination. This makes it slower than Star topology. 5 2) If one workstation or port goes down, the entire network gets affected. 3) Network is highly dependent on the wire which connects different components. III.3- Star Topology In Star topology, all the components of network are connected to a central device which may be a hub, a router or a switch. All the data on the star topology passes through the central device before reaching the intended destination. This later acts as a junction to connect different nodes present in Star Network, and at the same time it manages and controls whole of the network. Advantages of Star Topology 1) As compared to Bus topology it gives far much better performance, signals don’t necessarily get transmitted to all the workstations. 2) Easy to connect new nodes or devices. In star topology nodes can be added or removed easily without affecting rest of the network. 3) Centralized management. It helps in monitoring the network. 4) Failure of one node or link doesn’t affect the rest of network. At the same time it’s easy to detect the failure and troubleshoot it. Disadvantages of Star Topology 1) If the central device fails whole network goes down. 2) The use of an extra central device increases the overall cost of the network. 3) Performance and as well number of nodes which can be added in such topology is depended on capacity of central device. III.4- Tree Topology Tree Topology integrates the characteristics of Star and Bus Topology. In Tree Topology, the number of Star networks are connected using Bus. This main cable seems like a main stem of a tree, and other star networks as the branches. It is also called Expanded Star Topology. Ethernet protocol is commonly used in this type of topology. Advantages of Tree Topology 1. Expansion of Network is possible and easy. 2. Here, we divide the whole network into segments (star networks), which can be easily managed and maintained. 3. Error detection and correction is easy. 4. If one segment is damaged, other segments are not affected. Disadvantages of Tree Topology 1. Because of its basic structure, tree topology, relies heavily on the main bus cable, if it breaks whole network is crippled. 2. As more and more nodes and segments are added, the maintenance becomes difficult. 3. Scalability of the network depends on the type of cable used. III.5- Mesh topology 6 In a mesh network topology, each of the network node, computer and other devices, are interconnected with one another. Every node not only sends its own signals but also relays data from other nodes. In fact a true mesh topology is the one where every node is connected to every other node in the network. Advantages of Mesh topology 1) Data can be transmitted from different devices simultaneously. This topology can withstand high traffic. 2) Even if one of the components fails there is always an alternative present. So data transfer doesn’t get affected. 3) Expansion and modification in topology can be done without disrupting other nodes. Disadvantages of Mesh topology 1) There are high chances of redundancy in many of the network connections. 2) Overall cost of this network is way too high as compared to other network topologies. 3) Set-up and maintenance of this topology is very difficult. Even administration of the network is tough. III.6 Hybrid topology Similarly in this type of topology we integrate two or more different topologies to form a resultant topology which has good points (as well as weaknesses) of all the constituent basic topologies rather characteristics of one specific topology. than having Advantages of Hybrid Network Topology 1) Reliable : Unlike other networks, fault detection and troubleshooting is easy in this type of topology. 2) Scalable: It’s easy to increase the size of network by adding new components, without disturbing existing architecture. 3) Flexible: Hybrid Network can be designed according to the requirements of the organization and by optimizing the available resources. Disadvantages of Hybrid Topology 1) Complexity of Design: It’s not easy to design this type of architecture and it’s a tough job for designers. Configuration and installation process needs to be very efficient. 2) Costly Hub: The hubs used to connect two distinct networks, are very expensive. These hubs are different from usual hubs as they need to be intelligent enough to work with different architectures and should be function even if a part of network is down. 3) Costly Infrastructure: As hybrid architectures are usually larger in scale, they require a lot of cables; cooling systems, sophisticate network devices, etc. III.2 Logical topology The logical topology defines how the systems communicate across the physical topologies. Logical topologies are bound to network protocols and describe how data is moved across the network. Different network access existing are: CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA and Token Passing a) CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection) 7 Ethernet uses CSMA/CD to manage media access, as defined in the IEEE 802.3 specification. Devices that have data to transmit listen for an opening on the line before transmitting (Carrier Sense) and when a device detects an opening, it transmits its data. However, several devices may simultaneously sense that the line is clear and they may all transmit at the same time. If this happens, the data packets collide and the data is lost. This is called a collision. Using the CSMA/CD protocol, the devices will each detect that a collision has occurred (collision detection) and each of them will wait a random amount of time before retransmitting. The likelihood of two or more devices randomly selecting the same delay is almost zero, so retransmission is likely to be successful. b) CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance) With CSMA/CA, a device listens for an opportunity to transmit its data in a similar fashion to CSMA/CD. However, when a device senses an opening, it first transmits a signal notifying other devices that it is transmitting before actually sending the data. This means data packets will never collide, although warning packets might. Unfortunately, CSMA/CA creates a significant overhead as it adds unnecessary traffic to the network, slowing everything down. CSMA/CA was commonly used by older AppleTalk networks, but nowadays most Apple systems can use Ethernet hardware and use of CSMA/CA has declined. One area where CSMA/CA continues to be used is in wireless networks. c) Token Passing In CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA the chances of collisions are there. As the number of hosts in the network increases, the chances of collisions also will become more. In token passing, when a host want to transmit data, it should hold the token, which is an empty packet. The token is circling the network in a very high speed. If any workstation wants to send data, it should wait for the token. When the token has reached the workstation, the workstation can take the token from the network, fill it with data, mark the token as being used and place the token back to the network. IV. COMMUNICATION OVER NETWORK IV.1 What is data communication? A communication system can be defined as the collection of hardware and software that facilitates intersystem exchange of information between different devices. Data communication is the exchange of data between two devices using some form of wired or wireless transmission medium. It includes the transfer of data, the method of transfer and the preservation of data during the transfer process. IV.2 Characteristics of data communication For data communication to be effective, the following three fundamental characteristics should be considered:  Delivery: The system must deliver data to the correct or the intended destination.  Accuracy: The system must deliver data accurately (error-free).  Timeliness: The system must deliver data in a timely manner without enough time lags. IV.2- Data Communication Components There are five basic components in a data communication system  Message: The message is the information that is to be communicated.  Sender: The sender is the device that sends the message.  Receiver: The receiver is the device that receives the message. 8  Medium: The transmission medium is the physical path that communicates the message from the sender to the receiver.  Protocol: Protocol refers to a set of rules that coordinates the exchange of information. Both the sender and the receiver should follow the same protocol to communicate data. IV.3- Data Transmission Mode Data transmission mode refers to the direction of signal flow between two linked devices. There are three types of transmission modes—simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex 1) Simplex: The information flows in one direction across the circuit, with no capability to support response in the other direction. 2) Half-duplex: In half-duplex mode, each communicating device can receive and transmit information, but not at the same time. 3) Full-duplex: allows both communicating devices to transmit and receive data simultaneously. A full-duplex mode can be compared to a two-way road with traffic flowing in both directions. IV.4- Data Communication Measurement The measurement of the quantity of data that can be passed over a communication link in a given time is done in terms of bandwidth. On digital circuits, bandwidth is measured in bits per second (bps). In the digital context, the level of bandwidth falls into three categories.  Narrowband: In narrowband, there is a single transmission channel of 64 Kbps or less. There can be a number of 64 Kbps channels (N × 64 Kbps), but total capacity is not more than 1.544 Mbps.  Wideband: In wideband, the bandwidth lies between 1.544 Mbps (also called T1 line) and 45 Mbps (T3 line).  Broadband: The bandwidth capacity is equal to 45 Mbps. Broadcast television, cable television, microwave and satellite are examples of broadband technologies. IV.5 Analog and Digital Data Transmission The major role of the physical medium is to move the data from one communicating device to another. Depending on the form of signal used, data transmission can be analog data transmission or digital data transmission. 9  Analog Signals: Values on analog devices are (normally) infinitely variable. A speedometer that shows a car's speed by means of a dial is an analog device. The hand on that dial moves smoothly around the dial and can take any value that the car's engine can create.  Digital Signals: Digital signals and objects deal in the realm of the discrete or finite, meaning there is a limited set of values they can be. That could mean just two total possible values, 255, 4,294,967,296, or anything as long as it’s not ∞ (infinity). IV.6 Serial and Parallel Communication The transmission of binary data across a link can be accomplished in either parallel or serial mode. In parallel mode, multiple bits are sent with each clock tick. In serial mode, 1 bit is sent with each clock tick. IV.7 Data Transmission Method While there is only one way to send parallel data, there are two subclasses of serial transmission: asynchronous, synchronous.  With asynchronous transmission signal timing is not required; signals are sent in an agreed pattern of bits and if both ends are agreed on the pattern then communication can take place.  With synchronous transmission is data transfer method in which a continuous stream of data signals is accompanied by timing signals (generated by an electronic clock) to ensure that the transmitter and the receiver are in step (synchronized) with one another. The data is sent in blocks (called frames or packets) spaced by fixed time intervals. V. TRANSMISSION MEDIA A transmission medium (plural transmission media) refers to the physical media through which communication signals (data and information) can be transmitted from one point to another media. There are two categories of transmission media used in computer communications: - Guided Media (or Bounded Media, or Wired Media) - Unguided Media (or unbounded Media, or Wireless Media) V.1- Guided Media Guided media are the physical links through which signals are confined to narrow path. These are also called Bounded media. Bounded media are great for LABS because they offer high speed, good security and low cost. However, some time they cannot be used due distance communication. Three common types of bounded media are used of the data transmission. These are: coaxial cable, twisted pair cable and Fiber optic cables a) Twisted-Pair Wiring Twisted-pair wiring refers to a type of cable composed of four (or more) copper wires twisted around each other within a plastic sheath. The wires are twisted to reduce outside electrical interference. The RJ-45 connectors on twisted-pair cables resemble large telephone connectors. Twisted-pair cables come in two varieties: Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) and unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP). 10 → Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) UTP cable is the most common type of telecommunication medium in use today and is generally the best option for school networks. It is most suited for both data and voice transmission and hence is commonly used in telephone systems. The cable has four pairs of wire inside the jacket. An UTP cost less than STP easily available. There are five levels of data cabling - - - - - Cat 1: These are used in telephone lines and low speed data cable. Cat 2: These cables can support up to 4 mps implementation. Cat 3: These cable supports up to 16 mps and are mostly used in 10 mps. Cat 4: These are used for large distance and high speed. It can support 20mps. Cat 5: This is the highest rating for UTP cable and can support up to 100mps. → A disadvantage of UTP is that it may be susceptible to radio and electrical frequency interference. Shielded twisted pair (STP) is suitable for environments with electrical interference; however, the extra shielding can make the cables quite bulky. Shielded twisted pair is often used on networks using Token Ring topology. b) Coaxial Cable Coaxial cables have a single central conductor, which is made up of solid wire (usually copper). This conductor is surrounded by an insulator over which a sleeve of metal mesh is woven to block any outside interference. This metal mesh is again shielded by an outer covering of a thick material (usually PVC) known as jacket. Coaxial cable is very robust and is commonly used in Cable TV network. As compared to twisted pairs, it also offers higher bandwidth. A coaxial cable is capable of transmitting data at a rate of 10 Mbps. c) Fiber-Optic Cable Fiber optic (or optical fiber) refers to the technology associated with the transmission of information as light impulses along a glass wire or fiber. Optical fiber cable can transmit data over long distances with little loss in data integrity. In addition, because data are transferred as a pulse of light, optical fiber is not subject to interference. Fiber optic cable has the ability to transmit signals over much longer distances than coaxial and twisted pair. It also has the capability to carry information at vastly greater speeds. This capacity broadens communication possibilities to include services such as video conferencing and interactive services. however, it is more difficult to install and modify. 10BaseF refers to the specifications for fiber optic cable carrying Ethernet signals. Fig 4: bounded media 11 V.2- Unbounded Transmission Media Unguided media facilitate data transmission through the Earth's atmosphere (air, water or vacuum) at a much faster rate and provide wide area coverage. The data signals are not guided or bound to a fixed channel to follow. Some commonly used unguided media of transmission include radio frequency (RF) propagation, microwave transmission, satellite transmission, infrared wave transmission, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. a) Radio Frequency Propagation In radio frequency propagation, the signal is carried over carrier waves (waves, which carry signals over them), which have frequencies in the range of radio frequency spectrum. There are three types of radio frequency propagation—ground wave, ionospheric and line of sight. b) Microwave Transmission Microwave transmission use microwave signals that travel at a higher frequency and are popularly used for transmitting data over long distances. Microwave communication uses parabolic antennas (satellite TV dish antennas) that are mounted on the tower, which could be tens of kilometers away, but in line of sight. Due to long distances, repeaters are used at regular intervals in between the transmitter and the receiver to boost the signals c) Infrared Wave Transmission Infrared frequencies are just below the visible light spectrum. These are the high frequency waves used for short-range communication. The waves are cheap, directional and can be easily built; however, the waves do not pass through solid objects. Infrared waves are used in TV remotes, garage doors and wireless speakers. Computer machines in an office can easily be connected to a wireless LAN using infrared waves d) Satellite Transmission Satellite transmission is similar to microwave transmission except instead of transmission involving another nearby microwave dish antenna, it involves a satellite many miles up in space. The communication is carried through uplinks and downlinks. The uplink transmits the data to the satellite and downlink receives the data from the satellite. Uplinks and downlinks are also called earth stations because they are located on the Earth. e) Bluetooth transmission The Bluetooth technology is used to create a personal area network (PAN) or piconet that lets electronic devices such as computers, cell phones, PDAs and wireless keyboards to communicate with each other within the range of 10 m. It uses radio signals that are omnidirectional, that is, signals travel in all directions from the 12 source. Hence, the communicating devices need not be aligned with each other. f) Wi-Fi transmission The term Wi-Fi, which stands for Wireless Fidelity is widely used for creating wireless LANs and also for providing wireless Internet access. To create wireless LAN, the devices in the network such as computer, laptop and PDA should be equipped with wireless network interface card (NIC) to send and receive Wi-Fi signals. A WI-Fi-enabled device should be within a specific range (i.e. up to 50 m) from the network to connect. Media Type Twisted-pair (LAN) 1MHz Bandwidth Performance: Typical Error Rate Transfer rate Poor to fair (10–5) Coaxial cable (LAN) 10 Mbps – 100 Mbps 1GHz Good (10–7 to 10–9) Microwave (WAN) 10 Mbps – 1 Gbps 100GHz Good (10–9) Satellite (WAN) 6 Mbps – 54 Mbps 100GHz Good (10–9) Fiber (WAN) 50 Kbps – 100 Mbps 75THz Great (10–11 to 10–13) Table 2: Traditional Transmission Media Characteristics 50 Kbps – 100 Mbps VI. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS A communication protocol is a set of rules that coordinates the exchange of information. If one computer is sending information to another and they both follow the same protocol, the message gets through; regardless of what types of machines they are and on what operating systems they are running. As long as the machines have software that can manage the protocol, communication is possible. VI.1 Network protocol A protocol defines what is communicated, how it is communicated, and when it is communicated. The key elements of a protocol are syntax, semantics, and timing.  Syntax: Syntax refers to the structure or format of the data, meaning the order in which they are presented.  Semantics: Semantics refers to the meaning of each section of bits. How is a particular pattern to be interpreted, and what action is to be taken based on that interpretation.  Timing: Timing refers to two characteristics: when data should be sent and how fast they can be sent. Some important protocols are: Protocol Full meaning Its job File Transfer Protocol FTP Allows file transfer between two computers HTTP Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Protocol used in the web service TCP Transmission Control Protocol A reliable connection oriented protocol used to control the management of application level services between computers. IP Internet Protocol identifier of each computer or communication devices on the network and internet. ARP Address resolution protocol enables the packaging of IP data into ethernet package ICMP Internet control message protocol provides management and error reporting to help manage the process of sending data between computers. SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol An Internet protocol for transferring e-mail. POP post office protocol Telephone Network Transfert of e-mail, used to synchronize messages Telnet A method of opening a user session on a remote host. 13 14 PPP Point-to-Point Protocol Data transfer using modem UDP User Datagram Protocol An unreliable connection less protocol used to control the management of application level services between computers. DHCP Dynamic host configuration protocol is a method of assigning and controlling the IP addresses of computers on a given network VI.2 The OSI Model Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) is a standard reference model for communication between two end users in a network. In 1983, the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) published a document called 'The Basic Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection', which visualizes network protocols as a seven separate but related layers: physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation and application layers. The seven layers of the OSI reference model can be divided into two categories:  Upper Layers: The upper layers of the OSI model consist of the application, presentation and session layers. Primarily, these layers deal with application issues and are implemented only in the software.  Lower Layers: The lower layers of the OSI model comprise the transport, network, data link, and physical layers. These layers handle the data transport issues. The physical layer and data link layer are implemented in both hardware and software. The network and transport are generally implemented only in software. Physical (Layer 1) This layer conveys the bit stream - electrical impulse, light or radio signal -- through the network at the electrical and mechanical level. It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier, including defining cables, cards and physical aspects Protocols: Fast Ethernet, ATM Data Unit: Bit Device: Hubs, Repeaters, Cables and Connectors Data Link (Layer 2) Physical addressing, Provides low-level error detection and correction. For example if a packet is corrupted this layer is responsible for retransmitting the packet. Protocols: PPP, FDDI, Token ring, Ethernet, SLIP Device: NIC, Token Ring switches, Bridges Data Unit: Frame Network (Layer 3) This layer provides switching and routing technologies, creating logical paths, known as virtual circuits, for transmitting data from node to node. Routing and forwarding are functions of this layer, as well as addressing, internetworking, error handling, congestion control and packet sequencing. 15 Protocols: IPv4, IPV6, IPX, OSPF, NWlink, NetBEUI, ICMP, ARP, RARP Data Unit: Packet, Datagram Transport (Layer 4) This layer provides transparent transfer of data between end systems, or hosts, and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control. It ensures complete data transfer. Protocols: TCP, SPX and UDP Device: Router, gateway Data Unit: Segments Session (Layer 5) This layer establishes, manages and terminates connections between applications. The session layer sets up, coordinates, and terminates conversations, exchanges, and dialogues between the applications at each end. It deals with session and connection coordination. Protocols: NetBIOS Device: gateway Data Unit: data Presentation (Layer 6) This layer works to transform data into the form that the application layer can accept. This layer formats and encrypts data to be sent across a network, providing freedom from compatibility problems. It is also called the syntax layer. Protocol: SSL, WEP, WPA, Kerberos Device: Gateway Application (Layer 7) This layer supports application and end-user processes. Communication partners are identified, quality of service is identified, user authentication and privacy are considered, and any constraints on data syntax are identified. Everything at this layer is application specific. This layer provides application services for file transfers, e-mail, and other network software services. Protocol: DHCP, DNS, FTP, HTTP, IMAP4, NNTP, POP3, SMTP, SNMP, SSH, TELNET and NTP Device: PC Data Unit: Data VII. LAN TECHNOLOGIES Each computer in a LAN can effectively send and receive any information addressed to it. This information is in the form of data 'packets'. The standards followed to regularize the transmission of packets, are called LAN standards. There are many LAN standards as Ethernet, Token Ring , FDDI etc. Usually LAN standards differ due to their media access technology and the physical transmission medium. VII.1- Ethernet Media Standards The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineer) 802 Standards comprises a family of networking standards that cover the physical layer specifications of technologies. Ethernet, Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet are the LAN technologies most commonly used today. They are identified by three-part names, which is also known as Media Standard. An example of Media Standard is 10BASE-T.  The first part of the Media Standard specifies the transmission speed (10, in this case specifies 10 Mbps)  The second part of the name "BASE" specifies that the Ethernet signal is a Baseband signal.  The final part of the Ethernet Media Standard specifies the kind of cable used. Here T specifies twisted-pair cable. The following table shows the common Ethernet Media Standards. Name Cable Type Connector 10Base-T Maximum Length Speed Category 3 or better UTP cable RJ-45 100 meters(328 ft) 10Base-FL Fiber optic cable ST, SC, LC, MT-RJ 2000 meters 10 mbps 100Base-TX 10 mbps Cat 5 twisted pair RJ-45 100Base-FX 100 meters(328 ft) Fiber Optic ST, SC, LC, MT-RJ 2000 meters 100 mbps 1000Base-T 100 mbps CAT5e or higher RJ-45 100 meters(328 ft) Note: X represents a higher grade of connection, and 100BaseTX is twisted-pair cabling that can use either UTP or STP at 100 Mbps. With fibre-optic cable such as 100BaseFX, the speed is quicker than standard 10BaseF. The “L” stands for “Long” in long wave length lasers and "S" stands for Short Wave Length. 1 gbps VII.3- LAN protocols a) Ethernet / fast Ethernet The Ethernet protocol is by far the most widely used. Ethernet uses called CSMA/CD method. The Ethernet protocol allows for linear bus, star, or tree topologies. Data can be transmitted over wireless access points, twisted pair, coaxial, or fiber optic cable at a speed of 10 Mbps up to 1000 Mbps. To allow for an increased speed of transmission, the Ethernet protocol has developed a new standard that supports 100 Mbps. This is commonly called Fast Ethernet. Advantages of Ethernet are: Low cost components, Easy to install, Easy to troubleshoot b) Local Talk Local Talk is a network protocol that was developed by Apple Computer, Inc. for Macintosh computers. The method used by Local Talk is CSMA/CA. The Local Talk protocol allows for linear bus, star, or tree topologies using twisted pair cable. A primary disadvantage of Local Talk is speed. Its speed of transmission is only 230 Kbps. c) Token Ring The Token Ring protocol was developed by IBM in the mid-1980s. The access method used involves token-passing. The Token Ring protocol requires a star-wired ring using twisted pair or fiber optic cable. It can operate at transmission speeds of 4 Mbps or 16 Mbps. Due to the increasing popularity of Ethernet, the use of Token Ring in school environments has decreased. d) FDDI Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) uses a dual ring physical topology. The access method used by FDDI involves token-passing. Transmission normally occurs on one of the rings; however, if a break occurs, the system keeps information moving by automatically using portions of the second ring to create a new complete ring. A major advantage of FDDI is speed. It operates over fiber optic cable at 100 Mbps. e) ATM 16 17 Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a network protocol that transmits data at a speed of 155 Mbps and higher. ATM works by transmitting all data in small packets of a fixed size; whereas, other protocols transfer variable length packets. ATM supports a variety of media such as video, CD-quality audio, and imaging. ATM employs a star topology, which can work with fiber optic as well as twisted pair cable. Protocol Cable Speed Topology Method Ethernet Twisted Pair, Coaxial, Fiber 10 Mbps Linear Bus, Star, Tree CSMA/CD Fast Ethernet Twisted Pair, Fiber 100 Mbps Star CSMA/CD LocalTalk Twisted Pair .23 Mbps Linear Bus or Star CSMA/CA Token Ring Twisted Pair 4 Mbps - 16 Mbps Star-Wired Ring Token passing FDDI Fiber 100 Mbps Dual ring Token passing ATM Twisted Pair, Fiber 155-2488 Mbps Bus, Star, Tree Table Compare the Network Protocols VIII. NETWORK ADRESSING XI.1- What is an IP address? An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier for a node or host connection on an IP network. An IP address version 4 (IPv4) is a 32 bit binary number usually represented as 4 decimal values, each representing 8 bits, in the range 0 to 255 (known as octets) separated by decimal points. This is known as "dotted decimal" notation. Example: 140.179.220.200 It is sometimes useful to view the values in their binary form. 140.179.220.200 becomes 10001100.10110011.11011100.11001000 Every IP address consists of two parts, one identifying the network and one identifying the node. The Class of the address and the subnet mask determine which part belongs to the network address and which part belongs to the node address. XI.2- Address Classes The Internet community originally defined five address classes to accommodate networks of varying sizes. Microsoft TCP/IP supports class A, B, and C addresses assigned to hosts. The class of address defines which bits are used for the network ID and which bits are used for the host ID. It also defines the possible number of networks and the number of hosts per network. Class 1st Octet Decimal Range 1st Octet High Order Bits Network/Host ID (N=Network, H=Host) Default Subnet Mask Number of Networks Hosts per Network (Usable Addresses) A 1 – 126* 0 N.H.H.H 255.0.0.0 126 (27 – 2) 16,777,214 (224 – 2) B 128 – 191 10 N.N.H.H 255.255.0.0 16,382 (214 – 2) 65,534 (216 – 2) C 192 – 223 110 N.N.N.H 255.255.255.0 2,097,150 (221 – 2) 254 (28 – 2) D 224 – 239 1110 Reserved for Multicasting E 240 – 254 1111 Experimental; used for research Note: → Class A addresses 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 cannot be used and is reserved for loopback and diagnostic functions. → Class D addresses are reserved for IP multicast addresses. The four high-order bits in a class D address are always set to binary 1110. The remaining bits are for the address that interested hosts recognize. → Class E is an experimental address that is reserved for future use. The high-order bits in a class E address are set to 1111. → All bits within the network ID cannot be set to 1. All 1's in the network ID are reserved for use as an IP broadcast address. → All bits within the network ID cannot be set to 0. All 0's in the network ID are used to denote a specific host on the local network and are not routed. Private IP Addresses: There are addresses used in the private networks Class Private Networks Subnet Mask Address Range A 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 B 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.0.0 255.240.0.0 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 C 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 IX. NETWORK SECURITY Network security consists of the provisions and policies adopted by a network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network accessible resources. IX.1 Network Security Problems Network security problems can be divided roughly into four intertwined areas: secrecy, authentication, nonrepudiation and integrity control. 1. Secrecy: This is also called confidentiality, and has to do with keeping information out of the hands of unauthorized users. 2. Authentication: this deal with determining whom you are talking to before revealing sensitive information or entering into a business deal. 3. Nonrepudiation: This deals with signatures: How does amazon.ca prove that Kartik indeed placed an order for a book, which Kartik claims he never placed? 4. Integrity of service: How does one ensure that the message received was really the one sent, and not something that a malicious adversary modified in transit or concocted? IX.2 Types of attacks over a network We classify the attacks that compromise network security as passive attacks and active attacks. a) Passive Attacks: These attacks are in the nature of eavesdropping on, or monitoring of, transmissions. The goal of the opponent is to obtain information that is being transmitted. Passive attacks are very difficult to detect since they do not involve the alteration of the data. Two types of passive attacks are:  release of message contents where an eavesdropper tries to learn the contents of what is being transmitted. This can be prevented by encryption  traffic analysis: where the opponent tries to observe the pattern, frequency and length of messages being exchanged which could be used in guessing the nature of the communication that is taking place. 18 b) Active Attacks: Active attacks involve some modification of the data stream or the creation of a false stream. It is difficult to prevent active attacks absolutely because to do so would require physical protection of all communications facilities and paths at all times. Instead, the goal is to detect them and to recover from any disruption or delays caused by them. IX.3 Data compression and data encryption In other to send data easily through a network, it is required to compress it in other to reduce space for storage and bandwidth for transmission. Data compression is the process of converting data from a large format into a smaller format, usually by the means of an algorithm. Some popular examples of data compression techniques include: a) Graphic Interchange Format (GIF): This is a widely used compression format that is used for storing and transferring graphic images in relatively small files over computer network such as Internet b) Joint Picture Expert Group (JPEG): This is a popular file compression format for storing and transferring colour photograph and high quality images in relatively small files over computer network such as Internet c) Motion Picture Expert Group (MPEG): This is a standard file compression format for storing and transferring digital audio and video (moving images) in relatively small files over computer network d) Huffman coding: This is a lossless compression technique in which the characters in a data file are converted to a binary code, where the most common characters in the file have the shortest binary code, and the least common have the longest. e) Run-length encoding: This a compression technique that is designed for compressing, long, repetitive character strings in a piece of text, as well as compressing byte of a monochrome image file. An important characteristic feature in any coding scheme is the compression ratio. It is the ratio of a compressed file to the original uncompressed file. There are two basic form of data compression: lossless compression and lossy compression. - - Lossless compression is the form of compression in which the original data can be restores exactly.(ex: zip) Lossy compression is the form of compression in which the original data cannot be restored exactly due to loss of some of its elements (ex: mp3) Data encryption refers to mathematical calculations and algorithmic schemes that transform plaintext into cyphertext, a form that is non-readable to unauthorized parties. The recipient of an encrypted message uses a key which triggers the algorithm mechanism to decrypt the data, transforming it to the original plaintext version. 19 INFORMATION SYSTEM I. DATA PROCESSING CYCLE The term “data processing” (or by abuse information processing) usually refers to the manipulation off raw information (called data) to produce useful information. Information processing cycle refers to the sequence of events which includes four principal stages: Input, processing and output 1- Input: Data input refers to the various manual and automated ways by which data enter the computer. This stage involves collection of data from the outside or also from within the system. The input stage can be further broken down into data acquisition, data entry and data validation. - - - Data acquisition refers to the collection of the raw data from the outside so that it can be put into an Information system. Data entry is the process of putting the acquired data into the IS. Example: typing students details into a database Data validation refers to the process of checking the data to ensure it is error free. It uses routines also called validation routines or check routines, that check for correctness, meaningfulness and security of data that are input to the system.  format check: e.g. date has to be in the format DD/MM/YY  Data type check: e.g. the letter ‘O’ should not be typed instead of the integer 0.  Range check: The month should lie between 1 and 12  Limit check: the age should not be negative  Presence check: e.g. Any customer must have a telephone number  Consistency check: e.g. If Title = “Mrs”, then the gender = “F”  … 2- Processing : In this stage the computer processes the minutest details entered. It is the fact of manipulating data to produce information. Common processing methods  Batch Processing: This is a method where the information to be organized is sorted into groups to allow for efficient and sequential processing.  Online Processing: This is a method that utilizes Internet connections and equipment directly attached to a computer. It is used mainly for information recording and research.  Real-Time Processing: This technique has the ability to respond almost immediately to various signals in order to acquire and process information. 20  Distributed Processing: This method is commonly utilized by remote workstations connected to one big central workstation or server. ATMs are good examples of this data processing method. 3- Output: In this stage, the processed information is now transmitted to the user. Output is the act of sending out information by a data processing system such as the computer. 4- Other stages : Other stages include: (a) Storage: After the data has been processed, along with the output to the user, the data is also stored. (b) Retrieval: This is the reverse of storage (c) Communication: This is the process of sending data or information to another places. (d) Data verification: This is the process whereby the process is checked for accuracy and inconsistencies after data migration. Data verification is used to prevent errors occurring when data is copied from one medium to another. Common data verification methods include: - - - Proof reading (visual check): checked for errors by looking through the data. E.g. proof-reading a typed document Double keying: This is a check to see whether the data has been keyed in correctly. The data is keyed twice, and the computer will only accept the data for processing in the two versions are identical. Parity: Used to check for transmission errors over network or between memory and disk. An extra bit is added to each binary number before it is transmitted. Even parity system makes sure that each number has an even number of “1” bits. After transmission each number is checked to see if it still has an even number of “1” bits. If not, then the computer will conclude that the corruption of data has occurred. (e) Archiving: Archiving means taking the data off the main storage (e.g. hard drive) and storing it offline (not immediately available) usually on tape in the way it will not take up important hard disk space. (f) Deleting: This is the process of erasing or wiping our recorder data (usually from a recorded unit). II. INFORMATION SYSTEM 2.1. What is a System? We can define a System as a combination of resources or functional units working together to accomplish a given task. a) Basic element of a system The basic elements of the system may be listed as: → Resources: Resources can be hardware, software or liveware. → Procedures: Every system functions under a set of rules that govern the system to accomplish the defined goal of the system. This set of rules defines the procedures for the system → Data/Information, → Processes: The systems have some processes that make use of the resources to achieve the set goal under the defined procedures. b) Characteristics of a system Systems also exhibit certain features and characteristics, some of which are: 21 → Objective: Every system has a predefined goal or objective towards which it works. A system cannot exist without a defined objective. → Standards: It is the acceptable level of performance for any system. Systems should be designed to meet standards. → Environment: Every system whether it is natural or man made co-exists with an environment. It is very important for a system to adapt itself to its environment. → Feedback: Feedback is an important element of systems. The output of a system needs to be observed and feedback from the output taken so as to improve the system and make it achieve the laid standards. → Boundaries and interfaces: Every system has defined boundaries within which it operates. Beyond these limits the system has to interact with the other systems. c) Types of Systems → Manual Systems: These are systems that are basically mechanical in nature and do not require or use any automation. Such systems existed predominantly in the past and were not very reliable or fast. → Information Systems: (IS) Any system that makes use of automation and especially harnessed by people, procedures, software, hardware and digital data is called an information system (IS). 2.2. What is an Information System? An Information System (IS) is defined as an organized collection of technical and human resources for the processing, storing and distribution of an organization’s information. An IS using a computer is called a Computer Based Information System (CBIS). 2.2.1. Components of IS The 5 components that must come together in order to produce a Computer-Based Information system are:  Hardware: The term hardware refers to machinery. This category includes the computer itself, which is often referred to as the central processing unit (CPU), and all of its support equipments.  Software: The term software refers to computer programs and the manuals (if any) that support them.  Data: Data are facts that are used by programs to produce useful information.  Procedures: Procedures are the policies that govern the operation of a computer system. "Procedures are to people what software is to hardware" is a common analogy that is used to illustrate the role of procedures in a CBIS.  People: Often the most over-looked element of the CBIS are the people, probably the component that most influence the success or failure of information systems. 2.3. Importance of an IS in an organization To gain the maximum benefits from your company's information system, you have to exploit all its capacities. Importance of IS within an organisation are numerous:  Communication: Part of management is gathering and distributing information, and information systems can make this process more efficient by allowing managers to communicate rapidly.  Operations: How you manage your company's operations depends on the information you have. Information systems can offer more complete and more recent information, allowing you to operate your company more efficiently. 22  Decisions: The company information system can help you make better decisions by delivering all the information you need and by modelling the results of your decisions.  Records: Your Company needs records of its activities for financial and regulatory purposes as well as for finding the causes of problems and taking corrective action. 2.4. Types of Information System Information systems differ in their business needs. Also depending upon different levels in organization information systems differ. Three major information systems are: 1. Transaction processing 2. Management information system 3. Decision support system 4. Executive Information System 2.4.1. Executive Information System (EIS): This is a computer based system intended to help and support the information and decision making needs of senior executives of a company or organization. It provides easy access to internal and external information needed to achieve the strategic goals of the organization. It is commonly considered as a specialized form of DSS. Functions of a EIS in terms of data processing requirements Processing Inputs Outputs External Data Internal Files Pre-defined models Summarizing Simulation "Drilling Down" Summary reports Forecasts Graphs / Plots 2.4.2. Decision support system (DSS) A decision support system is a computer application that helps users analyse problems and make business decisions more confidently. It uses data routinely collected in organizations and special analysis tools to provide information support to complex decisions. To store all the necessary decision-making data, DSSs or EISs often use extremely large databases, called data warehouses. A data warehouse stores and manages the data required to analyze historical and current business circumstances. DSS manipulate and build upon the information from a MIS and/or TPS to generate insights and new information. Functions of a DSS in terms of data processing requirements Processing Inputs Outputs Internal Transactions Internal Files External Information? Modelling Simulation Analysis Summarizing Summary reports Forecasts Graphs / Plots 2.4.3. Management Information system (MIS) 23 The MIS is defined as a system which provides information support for decision making in the organization. They use the results of transaction processing and some other information also. It is an information system that generates accurate, timely and organized information so managers and other users can make decisions, solve problems, supervise activities, and track progress. An important element of MIS system is database. MIS are built on the data provided by the TPS Functions of a MIS in terms of data processing requirements Processing Inputs Outputs Internal Transactions Internal Files Structured data Sorting Merging Summarizing Summary reports Action reports Detailed reports 2.4.4. Transaction Processing System (TPS) A transaction processing system (TPS) is an information system that captures and processes data generated during an organization’s day-to-day transactions. A transaction is any activity of an organization including a business activity such as a deposit, payment, order or reservation. As computers became more powerful, system developers built online transaction processing systems. With online transaction processing (OLTP) the computer processes transactions as they are entered. Functions of a TPS in terms of data processing requirements Processing Inputs Outputs Transactions Events Validation Sorting Listing Merging Updating Calculation Lists Detail reports Action reports Summary reports? 2.4.5. Other types of information systems a) Office Automation System (OAS): These are systems that use varied computer machinery and software to digitally create, collect, store, manipulate and relay office information needed for accomplishing basic tasks in an organisation. All office functions like dictation, typing, filing, copying, fax, telex, microfilm and records management, telephone and telephone switch board operations are included. b) Expert system (ES): An expert system is an information system that captures and stores the knowledge of human experts and then imitates human reasoning and decision-making processes for those who have less expertise. Expert systems are composed of two main components: a knowledge base and inference rules. - - A knowledge base is the combined subject knowledge and experiences of the human experts. The inference rules are a set of logical judgments applied to the knowledge base each time a user describes a situation to the expert system. c) Integrated Information Systems (IIS): With today’s sophisticated hardware, software and communications technologies, it is often difficult to classify a system as belonging uniquely to one of the information system types discussed. Although expert systems still operate primarily as separate 24 systems, organizations increasingly are consolidating their information needs into a single, integrated information system. .4 SYSTEM LIFE CYCLE System life cycle is an organizational process of developing and maintaining systems. It helps in establishing a system project plan, because it gives overall list of processes and sub-processes required developing a system. System development life cycle means combination of various activities. In other words we can say that various activities put together are referred as system development life cycle. In the System Analysis and Design terminology, the system development life cycle means software development life cycle. Following are the different phases of software development cycle:  System study  Feasibility study  System analysis  System design  Coding  Testing  Implementation  Maintenance The different phases of software development life cycle Different phases of Software development Life Cycle 5 PHASES OF SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE Let us now describe the different phases and the related activities of system development life cycle in detail. (a) System Study System study is the first stage of system development life cycle. This gives a clear picture of what actually the physical system is? In practice, the system study is done in two phases. In the first phase, the 25 preliminary survey of the system is done which helps in identifying the scope of the system. The second phase of the system study is more detailed and in-depth study in which the identification of user’s requirement and the limitations and problems of the present system are studied. After completing the system study, a system proposal is prepared by the System Analyst (who studies the system) and placed before the user. The proposed system contains the findings of the present system and recommendations to overcome the limitations and problems of the present system in the light of the user’s requirements. To describe the system study phase more analytically, we would say that system study phase passes through the following steps:  problem identification and project initiation  background analysis  inference or findings (b) Feasibility Study On the basis of result of the initial study, feasibility study takes place. The feasibility study is basically the test of the proposed system in the light of its workability, meeting user’s requirements, effective use of resources and .of course, the cost effectiveness. The main goal of feasibility study is not to solve the problem but to achieve the scope. In the process of feasibility study, the cost and benefits are estimated with greater accuracy. (c) System Analysis Assuming that a new system is to be developed, the next phase is system analysis. Analysis involved a detailed study of the current system, leading to specifications of a new system. Analysis is a detailed study of various operations performed by a system and their relationships within and outside the system. During analysis, data are collected on the available files, decision points and transactions handled by the present system. Interviews, on-site observation and questionnaire are the tools used for system analysis. Using the following steps it becomes easy to draw the exact boundary of the new system under consideration:  Keeping in view the problems and new requirements  Workout the pros and cons including new areas of the system All procedures, requirements must be analysed and documented in the form of detailed data flow diagrams (DFDs), data dictionary, logical data structures and miniature specifications. System Analysis also includes sub-dividing of complex process involving the entire system, identification of data store and manual processes. The main points to be discussed in system analysis are:  Specification of what the new system is to accomplish based on the user requirements.  Functional hierarchy showing the functions to be performed by the new system and their relationship with each other.  Function network which are similar to function hierarchy but they highlight the those functions which are common to more than one procedure.  List of attributes of the entities - these are the data items which need to be held about each entity (record) (d) System Design Based on the user requirements and the detailed analysis of a new system, the new system must be designed. This is the phase of system designing. It is a most crucial phase in the development of a system. Normally, the design proceeds in two stages :  preliminary or general design  Structure or detailed design Preliminary or general design: In the preliminary or general design, the features of the new system are specified. The costs of implementing these features and the benefits to be derived are estimated. If the project is still considered to be feasible, we move to the detailed design stage. Structure or Detailed design: In the detailed design stage, computer oriented work begins in earnest. At this stage, the design of the system becomes more structured. Structure design is a blue print of a computer system solution to a given problem having the same components and inter-relationship among 26 the same components as the original problem. Input, output and processing specifications are drawn up in detail. In the design stage, the programming language and the platform in which the new system will run are also decided. There are several tools and techniques used for designing. These tools and techniques are:  Flowchart  Data flow diagram (DFDs)  Data dictionary  Structured English  Decision table  Decision tree Each of the above tools for designing will be discussed in detailed in the next lesson. (e) Coding After designing the new system, the whole system is required to be converted into computer understanding language. Coding the new system into computer programming language does this. It is an important stage where the defined procedure are transformed into control specifications by the help of a computer language. This is also called the programming phase in which the programmer converts the program specifications into computer instructions, which we refer as programs. The programs coordinate the data movements and control the entire process in a system. It is generally felt that the programs must be modular in nature. This helps in fast development, maintenance and future change, if required. (f) Testing Before actually implementing the new system into operations, a test run of the system is done removing all the bugs, if any. It is an important phase of a successful system. After codifying the whole programs of the system, a test plan should be developed and run on a given set of test data. The output of the test run should match the expected results. Using the test data following test run are carried out:  Unit test  System test Unit test: When the programs have been coded and compiled and brought to working conditions, they must be individually tested with the prepared test data. Any undesirable happening must be noted and debugged (error corrections). System Test: After carrying out the unit test for each of the programs of the system and when errors are removed, then system test is done. At this stage the test is done on actual data. The complete system is executed on the actual data. At each stage of the execution, the results or output of the system is analysed. During the result analysis, it may be found that the outputs are not matching the expected out of the system. In such case, the errors in the particular programs are identified and are fixed and further tested for the expected output. When it is ensured that the system is running error-free, the users are called with their own actual data so that the system could be shown running as per their requirements. (g) Implementation After having the user acceptance of the new system developed, the implementation phase begins. Implementation is the stage of a project during which theory is turned into practice. During this phase, all the programs of the system are loaded onto the user's computer. After loading the system, training of the users starts. Main topics of such type of training are:  How to execute the package  How to enter the data  How to process the data (processing details)  How to take out the reports After the users are trained about the computerised system, manual working has to shift from manual to computerised working. The following two strategies are followed for running the system: 27 i. Parallel run: In such run for a certain defined period, both the systems i.e. computerised and manual are executed in parallel. This strategy is helpful because of the following: o Manual results can be compared with the results of the computerised system. o Failure of the computerised system at the early stage, does not affect the working of the organisation, because the manual system continues to work, as it used to do. i. Pilot run: In this type of run, the new system is installed in parts. Some part of the new system is installed first and executed successfully for considerable time period. When the results are found satisfactory then only other parts are implemented. This strategy builds the confidence and the errors are traced easily. (h) Maintenance Maintenance is necessary to eliminate errors in the system during its working life and to tune the system to any variations in its working environment. It has been seen that there are always some errors found in the system that must be noted and corrected. It also means the review of the system from time to time. The review of the system is done for:  knowing the full capabilities of the system  knowing the required changes or the additional requirements  studying the performance If a major change to a system is needed, a new project may have to be set up to carry out the change. The new project will then proceed through all the above life cycle phases. 6 What You Have Learnt In this lesson systematic approach of any given problem is explained. Computer based systems are defined. System development life cycle is discussed in detail. The different phases of the development of system life cycle are explained in detail. 7 Terminal Question 1. Define a system. Explain the components of a system. 2. What do you understand by system development life cycle? 3. Discuss the importance of system analysis and design in the development of a system? 28 Systems Analysis & Design My experience has shown that many people find it hard to make their design ideas precise. They are willing to express their ideas in loose, general terms, but are unwilling to express them with the precision needed to make them into patterns. Above all, they are unwilling to express them as abstract spatial relations among well-defined spatial parts. I have also found that people aren't always very good at it; it is hard to do..... If you can't draw a diagram of it, it isn't a pattern. If you think you have a pattern, you must be able to draw a diagram of it. This is a crude, but vital rule. A pattern defines a field of spatial relations, and it must always be possible to draw a diagram for every pattern. In the diagram, each part will appear as a labeled or colored zone, and the layout of the parts expresses the relation which the pattern specifies. If you can't draw it, it isn't a pattern. Introduction The work of Christopher Alexander, a mathematician-turned architect, has had a subtle and yet a profound impact on the methodologies for the development of information systems in business. The main idea in architecture, espoused by Alexander, is that buildings and cities can be designed from the combination of certain basic patterns. Such patterns can be documented as diagrams which, in the architectural domain, specify spatial relationships. In the domain of business (and accounting) information systems development, the task is to create languages for describing and manipulating patterns to create systems that meet the needs of business. In this note, we shall study the way in which information systems are specified, and the methodology of Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that is often used in the development of accounting information systems. Specification of Information Systems Why specifications? Specification of any system before its development is crucial. Specifications perform for information systems the same function that blue-prints and engineering specifications perform for physical structures. Specifications serve as benchmarks for evaluating designs as well as their implementation. They also facilitate quality assurance via verification (are we building the system right, ie., do the design and implementation meet the specifications?) and validation ( are we building the right system, ie., does the system meet the user needs?). Components of specifications Specification of an information system is given by their  Structure: How it is organised.  Function: What it does.  Behavior: How it responds to events and stimuli.  Data: Its meaning and organization. Most CASE tools co-ordinate information systems projects through a project or system dictionary. The function of the dictionary is to standardise the use of terms throughout the organisation and to serve as a repository of all common information in the project. It enforces consistency as well as (relative) completeness of the specifications, and facilitates verification & validation of such specifications. It also serves as a means of communication between the different persons on the information systems building team.The figure below shows the various components of the specifications and the modeling techniques utilised. We will be studying some of those techniques in this course. Methodologies for Systems Development There are many methodologies for the development of information systems: Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), Data Structure-Oriented design, Object-Oriented design, Prototyping, among others. We shall, however, be concerned here primarily with SDLC. Systems Development Life Cycle: Referred to variously as the waterfall model and linear cycle, this methodology is a coherent description of the steps taken in the development of information systems. The reason why it is referred to as the waterfall model should be obvious from the following figure (from Horner, 1993): The methodology SDLC is closely linked to what has come to be known as structured systems analysis & design. It involves a series of steps to be undertaken in the development of information systems as follows:  Problem definition: On receiving a request from the user for systems development, an investigation is conducted to state the problem to be solved. o Deliverables: Problem statement.  Feasibility study: The objective here is to clearly define the scope and objectives of the systems project, and to identify alternative solutions to the problem defined earlier. o Deliverables: Feasibility report.  Systems analysis phase: The present system is investigated and its specifications documented. They should contain our understanding of HOW the present system works and WHAT it does. o Deliverables: Specifications of the present system.  Systems design phase: The specifications of the present system are studied to determine what changes will be needed to incorporate the user needs not met by the system presently. The output of this phase will consist of the specifications, which must describe both WHAT the proposed system will do and HOW it will work.of the proposed system. o Deliverables:Specifications of the proposed system.  Systems construction: Programming the system, and development of user documentation for the system as well as the programs. o Deliverables: Programs, their documentation, and user manuals.  System testing & evaluation: Testing, verification and validation of the system just built. o Deliverables: Test and evaluation results, and the system ready to be delivered to the user/client. The figure below provides an illustration for the above description. The waterfall model has many attractive features:  Clearly defined deliverables at the end of each phase, so that the client can take decisions on continuing the project.  Incremental resource committment. The client does not have to make a full committment on the project at the beginning.  Isolation of the problem early in the process. It does, however, have some drawbacks:  Requires an all-or-nothing approach to systems development. Does not allow incremental development.  Requires very early isolation of the problem. In the real world, often the problems are uncovered in the process of development of systems. Strategy in Analysis & Design The understanding and management of complexity is perhaps the most important task of the designer of an information system. It is carried out bearing in mind the strategies of abstraction as well as hierarchical ordering (divide & conquer). In the real world, an accounting information systems designer (systems designer for short) is rarely called upon to analyse and design a system from the scratch. Usually, such a system does exist, but the client (user) is not quite satisfied with it. The systems designer starts with the documentation of the existing accounting system, if it does not exist. Often, documentation pertaining to the existing system is contained in the audit workpapers pertaining to the auditor's study of control risk assessment. However, since such documentation is not prepared with a view to design a system, it is used only as a starting point in building the documentation to aid systems design. In this document, we shall study how abstraction and hierarchical ordering strategies are used to manage the complexity of analysing and designing the functions of an information system. The methodology of structured systems analysis & design provides a roadmap for the development of functional specifications for an accounting information system, shown in the Figure below. The functional specifications are documented graphically in Dataflow Diagrams (DFDs) described in the next section below. STEP 0: (Defining the scope of the system under study.) This accomplished by drawing the context diagram for the system. STEP 1: (Documentation of how the existing system works.) This is accomplished by drawing the Physical DFDs of the existing system. These DFDs specify the current implementation of the existing system, and would answer questions such as:  Who performs the tasks?  How they are performed?  When or how often they are performed?  How the data is stored (media)?  How the dataflows are implemented (media)? These physical DFDs may be levelled, or, if the system is not very large, prepared all on a single DFD. STEP 2: (Documentation of what the existing system does.)This is documented in Logical DFDs of the existing system. Deriving these logical DFDs of the existing system from the physical DFDs involve abstraction of all implementation details. Since the systems designer would not like to be tied down by the current implementation of the system, all such details are abstracted. These logical DFDs are usually levelled in order to reduce the perceived complexity of the system, and balanced in order to assure consistency in the design. STEP 3: (Documentation of what the proposed system will do.) After step 2, the systems designer will examine why the existing system does not meet the user requirements, and how it can be modified in order to meet such needs. The result is a set of logical DFDs which describe what the modified (proposed) system will do. These functional specifications are devoid of implementation considerations, and therefore rather abstract specifications of the proposed system. These logical DFDs are also levelled and balanced. STEP 4: (Documentation of how the proposed system will work.) The logical DFDs of the proposed system derived in step 3 above are then examined to determine which implementation of it meets the user requirements most efficiently. The result is a set of physical DFDs of the proposed system. They answer questions such as:  Who will perform the various tasks?  How they will be performed?  When or how often they will be performed?  How the data will be stored (media)?  How the dataflows will be implemented (media)? In this step, man-machine boundaries are drawn, and media selected for all dataflows & datastores. The function of any information system can be expressed in terms of transformation (processing) of certain inputs (which are data) into outputs (which are data too) where memory (which too consists of data) may need to be consulted (or updated). This suggests that two crucial elements in a system's description are data and processing of data. A complete description of an information system demands description of both these elements. In fact, we can reduce this, in a mundane fashion to the equation: System = Data + Processing of data While it is impossible to describe an information system exclusively in terms of data or its processing, it is possible to study a system's functions (what the system must do) in terms of the transformations it must perform of the data which is modeled separately. A coherent description of the information system, however, would require that the models of data and its processing are not inconsistent. An information system's functions, which describe its processing aspects, is modeled in the structured systems approach, as dataflow diagrams.Such a model of an information system is, for obvious reasons, referred to as functional model or process model. A dataflow diagram consists of external entities (represented by rectangles), processes (represented by either rounded rectangles or circles), data stores (represented by either an open rectangle or two parallel lines) and dataflows (represented by arrows).

ALGORITHM I.1. Definition Algorithms are one of the most basic tools that are used to develop the problem-solving logic. An algorithm is defined as a finite sequence of explicit instructions that when provided with a set of input values, produces an output and then terminates. Algorithm is not language specific. We can use the same flowchart to code a program using different programming languages. Many algorithms can be design for the same task. I.2. Properties of an algorithm Note that algorithms are not computer programs, as they cannot be executed by a computer. Some properties of algorithm are as follows: • Finiteness – the algorithm stops after a finite number of instructions are executed. • Definiteness or unambiguous: There must be no ambiguity in any instruction. This means that the action specified by the step cannot be interpreted in multiple ways & can be performed without any confusion. • Input:- an algorithm accepts zero or more inputs • Output:- it produces at least one output. • Effectiveness:- it consists of basic instructions that are realizable. This means that the instructions can be performed by using the given inputs in a finite amount of time. I.3. Example of algorithm We use algorithms in our daily life. For example, to wash hand, the following algorithms may be used. 1. Start 2. Turn on water 3. dispense soap 4. wash hand till clean 5. Rince soap off 6. Turn off water 7. Dry hand 8. Stop 1. Start 2. Turn on water 3. dispense soap 4. Repeat Rub hands together 5. until hand clean 6. Rince soap off 7. Turn off water 8. Dry hand 9. Stop The above-mentioned algorithm terminates after six steps. This explains the feature of finiteness. Every action of the algorithm is precisely defined; hence, there is no scope for ambiguity. XVII. REPRESENTATION OF AN ALGORITHM Algorithms can be represented in different ways: - By Flowchart - By Pseudocode II.1. Flowchart Flowchart is the diagrammatic representation of an algorithm with the help of symbols carrying certain meaning. Using flowchart, we can easily understand a program. a) Flowchart Symbols Symbol Flowcharts use simple geometric symbols and arrows to define relationships. Some standard symbols that are frequently required for flowcharts are shown: Symbol name Flow Lines Description Flow lines are used to connect symbols. These lines indicate the sequence of steps and the direction of flow. Terminal The terminator symbol represents the start points, end points, and potential outcomes of a path. Processing used to illustrate a process, action or an operation. Examples: "Add 1 to X"; "save changes" or similar. Decision These typically contain a Yes/No question or True/False test. Input/output It represents data that is available for input or output. It may also represent resources used or generated. Ex: Get X from the user; display X. Connector Connector symbol is used to join different flow lines. Off- page Connecter This symbol is used to indicate the flowchart continues on the next page Document Document is used to represent a paper document produced during the flowchart process. Manual Input Manual input symbol represents input to be given by a developer / programmer. Magnetic Disk This is used to represent data input or output from and to a magnetic disk. b) Advantages of flowchart The flowchart shows how the program works before you begin actually coding it. Some advantages of flowcharting are the following. - - - - Communication: Flowcharts are helpful in explaining the program to other people. Effective analysis: With the help of flowchart, the problem can be analysed more effectively Proper documentation: Program flowchart serves as a good program documentation, which is needed for various purposes. Efficient coding: Once the flowchart is drawn, it becomes easy to write the program in any high level language - - Proper debugging: The flowchart help in the debugging process Efficient program maintenance: The maintenance of operating program become easy with the help of flowchart c) Limitations of Flowcharts Flowchart can be used for designing the basic concept of the program in pictorial form, but cannot be used for programming purposes. Some of the limitations of the flowchart are given below: • Complex: The major disadvantage in using flowcharts is that when a program is very large, the flowcharts may continue for many pages, making them hard to follow. • Costly: If the flowchart is to be drawn for a huge program, the time and cost factor of program development may get out of proportion, making it a costly affair. • Difficult to Modify: Due to its symbolic nature, any change or modification to a flowchart usually requires redrawing the entire logic again, and redrawing a complex flowchart is not a simple task. • No Update: Usually, programs are updated regularly. However, the corresponding update of flowcharts may not take place, especially in the case of large programs. II.2. Pseudocode Pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what an algorithm must do, expressed in a formally-styled natural language rather than in a programming language. It describe the entire logic of the algorithm so that implementation becomes a rote mechanical task of translating line by line into source code. a) Pseudocode Structures Before going ahead with pseudocode, let us discuss some keywords, which are often used to indicate input, output and processing operations. • Input: READ, OBTAIN, GET and PROMPT • Output: PRINT, DISPLAY and SHOW • Compute: COMPUTE, CALCULATE and DETERMINE • Initialize: SET and INITIALIZE • Add One: INCREMENT b) Example of pseudocode The pseudocode given below calculates the area of a rectangle. Pseudocode: To calculate the area of a rectangle START PROMPT the user to enter the length of the rectangle PROMPT the user to enter the width of the rectangle COMPUTE the area by multiplying the length with width DISPLAY the area STOP c) Advantages of Using Pseudocode Some of the most significant benefits of pseudocode are as follows: • It is easier to develop a program from a pseudocode rather than from a flowchart or decision table. • Often, it is easy to translate pseudocode into a programming language, a step which can be accomplished by less-experienced programmers. • Unlike flowcharts, pseudocode is compact and does not tend to run over many pages. Its simple structure and readability makes it easier to modify as well. • Pseudocode allows programmers who work in different computer languages to talk to each other. d) Disadvantages of Using Pseudocode Although pseudocode is a very simple mechanism to simplify problem-solving logic, it has its own limitations. Some of the most notable limitations are as follows: • It does not provide visual representation of the program logic. • There are no accepted standards for writing pseudocodes. Different programmers use their own style of writing pseudocode. • It is quite difficult for the beginners to write pseudocode as compared to drawing a flowchart. XVIII. ALGORITHM STRUCTURES The 'structured' part of pseudocode and flowchart is a notation for representing three general programming constructs: sequence, selection and repetition. Each of these constructs can be embedded inside any other construct. It has been proven that three basic constructs for flow of control are sufficient to implement any 'proper' algorithm. • Sequence, where information can flow in a straight line. • Selection (branched), where the decisions are made according to some predefined condition. • Repetition, where the logic can repeat in a loop, that is, where a sequence of steps is repeated until the desired output is obtained. III.1 Sequence Sequence construct is a linear progression where one task is performed sequentially after another. The actions are performed in the same sequence (top to bottom) in which they are written Fig. Flowchart and Pseudocode for Sequence Construct Example Write an algorithm and flowchart for calculating the perimeter and surface of square, if the default length of the sides of the square is a. Flowchart Pseudocode C Begin Input a P = 4 × a S = A × a Print P, S END #include int main() { int a, P, S; printf(“Enter the length”); scanf(“%d”,&a); P = 4 * a ; S = a * a ; printf(“\nPerimetre = %d”, P); printf(“\nSurface = %d”, S); return 0 ; } Note that there is no branching and no process is repeated again. Each process is contributing something to the next process. III.2 Selection (Decision) Selection is a process of deciding which choice is made between two or more alternative courses of action. Selection logic is depicted as an IF-THEN-ELSE-ENDIF or CASE ENDCASE structure. As the name suggests, in case of the IF-THEN-ELSE-ENDIF construct, if the condition is true, the true alternative actions are performed and if condition is false, then false alternative actions are performed on. a) IF-THEN-ELSE-ENDIF construct Flowchart Pseudocode C • • • IF condition THEN List of actions ELSE List of different actions ENDIF • • • • • if(condition) { List of actions } Else { List of different actions } • • Note that the ELSE keyword and 'Action 2' are optional. In case you do not want to choose between two alternate courses of actions, then simply use IF-THEN-ENDIF Flowchart Pseudocode C • • • IF condition THEN List of actions ENDIF • • • • • • if(condition) { List of actions } • • • Hence, if the condition is true, then perform the list of actions listed in the IF-THEN-ENDIF construct and then move on to the other actions in the process. In case the condition is false, then move on to the rest of the actions in the process directly. Let us write a pseudocode to find the largest of three numbers Example: Write an algorithm and flowchart which a given number N increased by 100 if N is less than 100, otherwise N is decreased by the 100. Print this result. Flowchart Pseudocode START C Input N If N < 100 Then N = N × 100 Else N = N - 100 Print N STOP #include int main() { int N; printf("Enter the number: "); scanf("%d",&N); if(N<100) N=N+100; Else N=N-100; printf("\nnumber is %d",N); return 0; } b) CASE-ENDCASE construct If there are a number of conditions to be checked, then using multiple IFs may look very clumsy. Hence, it is advisable to use the CASE-ENDCASE selection construct for multipleway selection logic. A CASE construct indicates a multiway branch based on many conditions. CASE construct uses four keywords, CASE, OF, OTHERS and ENDCASE, along with conditions that are used to indicate the various alternatives. Flowchart Pseudocode C CASE expression OF Condition 1: Sequence 1 Condition 2: Sequence 2 • • Condition n: Sequence n OTHERS : default sequence ENCASE case (expression) { case value 1: Sequence 1; break ; case value 2: Sequence 2; break ; • • case value n: Sequence n; break ; default : default sequence ; } CASE construct performs the same process as multiple IFs, but it is much easier to read and write. Conditions are normally numbers or characters indicating the value of 'Expression' Example: To assign discount according to the code Flowchart Pseudocode C START READ code CASE Grade OF A : discount = 0.0 B : discount = 0.1 C : discount = 0.2 OTHERS : discount = 0.3 ENDCASE DISPLAY discount STOP #include int main() { char code ; switch ( code ) { case 'A': discount = 0.0; break; case 'B': discount = 0.1; break; case 'C': discount = 0.2; break; default: discount = 0.3; } Printf( "discount is: %f ", discount); } III.3 Repetition (Looping) Looping construct is used when some particular task(s) is to be repeated for a number of times according to the specified condition. By using looping, the programmer avoids repeating the same set of instructions. As the selection, the loop is also represented in flowchart by a diamond. The difference is just at the orientation of the arrows. a) WHILE- ENDWHILE In case of WHILE-ENDWHILE, the loop will continue as long as the condition is true. The loop is entered only if the condition is true. The 'statement' is performed for each iteration. At the conclusion of each iteration, the condition is evaluated and the loop continues as long as the condition is true. Flowchart Pseudocode WHILE condition is True statements ENDWHILE C while (condition) { statements } Example: To display the first ten natural numbers using DO WHILE-ENDDO Flowchart Pseudocode C INITIALIZE Count to zero WHILE Count >= 10 ADD 1 to Count PRINT Count ENDWHILE STOP #include main() { int i=0; while(i<10) { printf("%d ",i); i++; } return 0; } b) REPEAT-UNTIL The REPEAT-UNTIL loop is similar to the WHILE-ENDWHILE, except that the test is performed at the bottom of the loop instead of at the top Flowchart Pseudocode C Repeat Statements Until condition is false Do { } While (condition) The 'statement' in this type of loop is always performed at least once, because the test is performed after the statement is executed. At the end of each iteration, the condition is evaluated, and the loop repeats until the condition gets true. The loop terminates when the condition becomes true. Example To display the first ten natural numbers using REPEAT-UNTIL Flowchart Pseudocode C INITIALIZE Count to zero REPEAT ADD 1 to Count PRINT Count UNTIL Count is less than 10 STOP #include main() { int i=0; do { printf("%d ",i); i++; } while(i<10); return 0; } APPLICATION EXERCISES Exercise 1: Write the flowchart corresponding to the following pseudo code Pseudocode 1 Pseudocode 2 Pseudocode 2 Start num1 = 5 num2 = 10 num3 = 15 sum = num1 + num2 + num3 average = sum/3.0 print average Stop Set total to zero Set grade counter to one While grade counter is less than or equal to ten Input the next grade Add the grade into the total Set the class average to the total divided by ten Print the class average. initialize passes to zero initialize failures to zero initialize student to one while student counter <= to ten input the next exam result if the student passed add one to passes else add one to failures add one to student counter print the number of passes print the number of failures if eight or more students passed print "raise tuition" Exercise 2: Create flowcharts to represent these short tasks: a. “If it’s raining, bring an umbrella.” b. “Take twenty paces, then turn and shoot.” c. “Go forward until the Touch Sensor (on port 1) is pressed in, then stop.” d. “Follow Liberty Avenue for 2 miles, then take a left turn onto 40th Street. Go until you reach the bridge, but don’t cross the bridge. Instead, make a right turn onto Foster Street, then take the first left turn. Follow that road until you reach the National Robotics Engineering Consortium building.” e. “Turn on oven. Cook turkey for 4 hours or until meat thermometer reaches 180 degrees.” Exercise 3: Make the flowchart, and write the pseudocode for the following problem: Given a Fahrenheit temperature, calculate and display the equivalent centigrade temperature. The following formula is used for the conversion: C = 5 / 9 * (F – 32) where F and C are the Fahrenheit and centigrade temperatures. Exercise 4: On a separate sheet of paper, make a flowchart organizing the “flow” of getting ready to go to school in the morning. Be sure to include the following steps in your chart, but don’t be afraid to add other things if you need them! Exercise 5: Let’s consider the following flowchart a) Identity the programming construct available in the flowchart and explain how each of them works. b) Do the dry run of the flowchart c) What does the flowchart do? d) Write the corresponding pseudocode of the flowchart DATA TYPES AND DATA STRUCTURES The primary purpose of most computer programs is to store and retrieve data rather than to perform calculations. There are many different ways to organize data for storage and retrieval, and each type of organization is well suited to solving certain kinds of problems and poorly suited to solving problems of other kinds. Consequently, the way in which a program's data is organized may have a profound effect on the program's running time and memory requirements. The finite set of values along with set of rules for different operations is called data type and the study of data organization is called data structures and is the primary focus of this topic. Learning objectives After studying this chapter, student should be able to:  Give examples of data types and state how their represented in the memory.  Appreciate and use concepts of data structure as array, pointer, structure, linked list, …  Appreciate the advantages of abstract data types as a software development strategy.  To develop significant facility with the Abstract Data Type like Stack, Queue, binary tree, and Hash table  Implement Abstract Data Type used data structures Contents I.

ABSTRACT DATA TYPES .................................................................................................... 52 XIX. INTRODUCTION TO DATA TYPE A programming language is proposed to help programmer to process certain kinds of data and to provide useful output. A program usually contains different types of data types (integer, float, character etc.). C language is rich of data types. A programmer has to employ proper data type as per his requirements. Data type exists in various types: - - - Primitive or primary, or atomic data type Composite, or complex, or secondary data type Abstract data type NB: The size a data type is compiler dependent. One can be using 2 bytes to represent an integer while another is using 4 bytes. In C, the size of a data type can be obtained using the function sizeof() defined in the library stdio.h. For instance, with the declaration int p, we have sizeof(p) = sizeof(int) = 4; XX. PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES Primitive data types are standard predefined types that you can use as the basis for variables, record fields, or your own Data Item parts. Though exact names may vary, many of these types (like INT) are common to most programming languages. C and other procedural languages often refer to these types as "elementary items" because they are not based on any other type. Classic basic primitive types may include:  Character (character, char);  Integer (integer, int, short, long, byte) with a variety of precisions;  Floating-point number (float, double, real, double precision);  Boolean, logical values true and false.  Pointer (also called reference ), a small value referring to another object's address in memory, possibly a much larger one. II.1 Boolean type The Boolean type represents the values: true and false. Although only two values are possible, they are rarely implemented as a single binary digit for efficiency reasons. Many programming languages like C do not have an explicit Boolean type, instead interpreting (for instance) 0 as false and other values as true. Having a Boolean data type can be important for a programming language because a single bit can be used to store a variable of such type. II.2 Integer Data Types: Integers are whole numbers with a range of values, which are machine dependent. Generally an integer occupies 2 or 4 bytes memory space and its value range limited to 32768 to +32767(that is, -215 to +215-1). (A signed integer use one bit for storing sign and rest 15 bits for number.) To control the range of numbers and storage space, C has three classes of integer storage namely short int, int and long int. All three data types have signed and unsigned forms. A short int requires half the amount of storage than normal integer. Unlike signed integer, unsigned integers are always positive and use all the bits for the magnitude of the number. Therefore, the range of an unsigned integer will be from 0 to 65535. The long integers are used to declare a longer range of values and it occupies 4 bytes of storage space. Data Type Bytes Range Format short int or signed short int 2 -32768 to +32767 %d unsigned short int 2 0 to 65535 %u long int or signed long int or long 4 -2147483648 to +2147483647 %ld unsigned long int or unsigned long 4 0 to 4294967295 %Ld II.3 Floating Point Data Types: The floating point data type is used to store fractional numbers (real numbers) with 6 digits of precision. Floating point numbers are denoted in C by the keyword float. When the accuracy of the floating point number is insufficient, we can use the double to define the number. The double is same as float but with longer precision and takes double space (8 bytes) than float. To extend the precision further we can use long double which occupies 12 bytes of memory space. Data Type Bytes Range Format Float 4 -3.4e 38 to +3.4e38 %f Double 8 -1.7e 308 to +1.7e 308 %lf long double 12 -1.7e 4932 to +1.7e 4932 %Lf II.4 Character Data Type: The character data types are used to store the special character and alphabets. It consists of ASCII characters. It occupies one byte of memory. It can be signed and unsigned i.e they have the range of -128 to +127 and 0 to 255 respectively. The following table shows the different character data types. Data Type Bytes Range Format Signed char or char 1 -128 to 127 %c Unsigned char 1 0 to 255 %c XXI. COMPOSITE DATA TYPE In computer science, a composite data type is any data type which can be constructed in a program using its programming language's primitive data types and other composite types. The act of constructing a composite type is known as composition. III.1 Record A record also called a structure is a group of related data items stored in fields, each with its own name and datatype. Suppose you have various data about an employee such as name, salary, and hire date. These items are logically related but dissimilar in type. A record containing a field for each item lets you treat the data as a logical unit. Thus, records make it easier to organize and represent information. Such a declaration can be as follow: pseudocode In C Type employee = record Name: string Salary: number sex: character endrecord struct person { char name[50]; float salary; char sex; }; The size of a structure depends on the data type of its each field. For instance, for example with the structure defined above, Sizeof (struct person) = 50 * sizeof(char) + sizeof(float) + sizeof(char) = 50*1 + 4 + 1 = 55 bytes III.2 Array data type An array is a sequenced collection of elements of the same data type with a single identifier name. Arrays can have multiple axes (more than one axis). Each axis is a dimension. Thus a single dimension array is also known as a vector. A two dimension array is commonly known as a matrix (a spreadsheet like Excel is a two dimension array). Example: Tab is an array We refer to the individual values as members (or elements) of the array. There is only one identifier name assigned to the array. The position of an element in an array is called index and is written in bracket. If Tab is an array, Tab[i] represent the element at the ith position. Example: Tab[4] = 32, Tab[7] = 15 21 45 65 32 75 98 15 34 11 20 Declaration In pseudocode In C Age = array[1 to 5] of integer int age[5]; Age is an array of 5 integers. Notice that in C the index is not defined by the user but the first is always 0 Here, the size of array age is 5 times the size of int (ie 20 bytes) because there are 5 elements. Suppose, the starting address of age[0] is 2120 and the size of int be 4 bytes. Then, the next address (address of a[1]) will be 2124, address of a[2] will be 2128 and so on. Accessing array elements In pseudocode In C Age[2] ← 4 Age[2] = 4; Read(Age[1]) Scanf(“%d”, &Age[1]) A for loop can be used to easily access elements of an array In pseudocode In C For ind FROM 1 to 5 DO print(Age[i]) ENDFOR For(ind=0; i<5; i++) Printf(“%d” In pseudocode Multidimensional Arrays Multidimensional array is also called arrays of arrays or matrix. For example: A=array[1to 3, 1 to 6] of real In C float A[3][6]; Here, A is an array of two dimension, which is an example of multidimensional array. This array has 3 rows and 6 columns In C the first element of the array is A[0][0], then the next A[0][1], A[0][2], … For better understanding of multidimensional arrays, array elements of above example can be thinked of as below: Col 1 Col 2 Col 3 Col 4 Col 5 Col 6 Row 1 A[1,1] A[1,2] A[1,3] A[1,4] A[1,5] A[1,6] Row 2 A[2,1] A[2,2] A[2,3] A[2,4] A[2,5] A[2,6] Row 3 A[3,1] A[3,2] A[3,3] A[3,4] A[3,5] A[3,6] To access elements of a matrix, a nested for loop can be used. Example In pseudocode In C for (i=0; i<3; i++) for (j=0; j<6; j++) FOR i FROM 1 TO 3 DO FOR j FROM 1 TO 6 DO Print(A[i, j]) ENDFOR ENDFOR printf(“%d”, A[i][j]); III.3 String A string is any finite sequence of characters (i.e., letters, numerals, symbols and punctuation marks). An important characteristic of each string is its length, which is the number of characters in it. In C, a string is represented as an array of characters In pseudocode In C Name : string Char name[20] Here the variable name cannot be more than 20 characters. In the variable name contain “lonlac”, then we have name[0]=’l’, name[1]=’o’, name[2]=’n’ and so on. III.4 Pointer Pointers are widely used in programming; they are used to refer to memory location of another variable without using variable identifier itself. They are mainly used in linked lists and call by reference functions. The figure below illustrates the idea of pointers. As you can see below; Yptr is pointing to memory address 100. Figure: Pointer and memory relationship “pointers contain memory addresses, not data values!” When you declare a simple variable, like int i; a memory location with a certain address is set aside for any values that will be placed in i. We thus have the following picture: • After the statement i=35; the location corresponding to I will be filled You can find out the memory address of a variable by simply using the address operator &. Here is an example of its use: &v = FFD2 The above expression should be read as “address of v”, and it returns the memory address of the variable v. Pointer Declaration Like all other C variables, pointers must be declared before they are used. The syntax for pointer declaration is as follows: Datatype * identifier; Examples int* p; // p is a pointer to an integer double* offset; // offset is a pointer to a double Note that the prefix *defines the variable to a pointer. In the above example, p is the type “pointer to integer” and offset is the type “pointer to double”. Once a pointer has been declared, it can be assigned an address. This is usually done with the address operator. For example, int *p; int count; p = &count; After this assignment, we say that p is “referring to” the variable count or “pointing to” the variable count. The pointer p contains the memory address of the variable count. Application of pointer: Linked list A linked list is a finite sequence of nodes each of which contains a pointer field pointing to the next node. It is a dynamic data structure whose length can be increased or decreased at run time. Comparison between link list and array:  Array size is fix or static and cannot change at run time, But in link list we can create memory according to requirement..  In an array, all the elements are kept at consecutive memory locations while in a linked list the elements (or nodes) may be kept at any location but still connected to each other.  Insertion and deletion are costly in array while in a link list it is simple  Link list has efficient memory utilization. Linked lists are preferred mostly when you don’t know the volume of data to be stored. The capacity can be increased (or decreased) at run time  Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists.  Linear data structure such as stack and queue can easily implemented using link list The definition For the purpose of this document, we shall define a list as a pointer to a structure of type cell like this: Type list = record Element: integer next: list endrecord struct list { int element; struct list next; }; Doubly linked list In a doubly linked list, each node contains, besides the next-node link, a second link field pointing to the previous node in the sequence. The two links may be called forward(s) and backwards, or next and prev(ious). XXII. ABSTRACT DATA TYPES IV.1 Definition The data types you have seen so far are all concrete, in the sense that we have completely specified how they are implemented. An abstract data type, or ADT, specifies a set of operations (or methods) and the semantics of the operations (what they do), but it does not specify the implementation or the details of the operations. That’s what makes it abstract. A Data structure is an implementation of an ADT; a data structure is concrete, i.e., a data structure makes an ADT a reality by specifying how to represent instances of the data type and how to perform operations on those instances Components of Abstract Data Types An abstract data type is an encapsulation mechanism. In general it is composed of several components  A data type  A set of operations (called the methods or operations).  A signature: A precise description of the types of the methods.  A set of axioms: A precise set of rules about how it behaves  A set of implementation hidden from the programmer who uses the data type. In an ADT, operation can be a function or a predicate. An example ADT already familiar to you appears below. integer: a whole number Operations signatures:  addition (+) : interger x integer → integer  subtraction (-) : interger x integer → integer  multiplication (*) : interger x integer → integer  division (/) : interger x integer → real  modulus (%) : interger x integer → integer There exist two main types of abstract data types: Linear ADT (vector, queue, stack, …) and NON-Linear ADT (binary tree, …) IV.2 Common examples of ADT IV.2.1 The Queue a) Definition A queue is a linear collection of items, where an item to be added to the queue must be placed at the rear (tail) of the queue and items that are removed from the queue must be removed from the front. A queue is referred to as a FIFO data structure: First In, First Out. b) The operations There are actually very few operations on a queue. Operation Signature Enqueue() queue x item → queue specification add an item to the queue Dequeue() queue → item x queue remove an item from the queue Front() queue → item Emptyqueue() queue → Boolean access the first item at the front of the queue Test if the queue is empty Fullqueue() queue → Boolean Test if the queue is full queueSize() Queue → integer return the number of element in a queue c) Example Table : Example Queue Operations Queue Operation Queue Contents Return Value q.isEmpty() isEmpty(q) [] True q.enqueue(4) Enqueue(q,4) [4] q.enqueue('dog') Enqueue(q,’dog’) ['dog',4] q.enqueue(True) Enqueue(q,true) [True,'dog',4] q.size() size(q) [True,'dog',4] 3 q.isEmpty() isEmpty(q) [True,'dog',4] False q.enqueue(8.4) Enqueue(q,8.4) [8.4,True,'dog',4] q.dequeue() Dequeue(q) [8.4,True,'dog'] 4 q.dequeue() Dequeue(q) [8.4,True] 'dog' q.size() Size(q) [8.4,True] 2 d) Queue implementation  Array implementation Since a queue usually holds a bunch of items with the same type, we could implement a queue with an array. One of the things we'll need to keep track of is the number of elements in the queue, i.e., not all the elements in the array may be holding elements of the queue at any given time. So far, the pieces of data we need for our array implementation of the queue are: an array, a count  Linked list implementation The diagrams in Figures below show a simple queue before and after adding a new item and before and after removing an item. At each point, you can add a new item only at the rear of the queue and can remove an item only from the front of the queue. (Note that the front of the queue, where you delete items, is at the left of the diagrams. The rear of the queue, where you add items, appears to the right.) Figure a: A simple queue just before a fourth item is added Figure b: The simple queue after the fourth item is added and before an item is removed Figure c: The simple queue after an item has been removed IV.2.2 The Stack a) The definition A stack is a linear collection of similar items, where an item to be added to the stack must be placed on top of the stack and items that are removed from the stack must be removed from the top. The top of the stack is known as the top. The term push means to add an item to the stack, and the term pop means to remove an item from the stack. A stack is referred to as a LIFO data structure: Last In, First Out. b) The operations There are actually very few operations on a stack. Operation Signature Push() specification stack x item → stack add an item to the stack Pop() stack → item remove an item from the stack Top() stark → item emptyStack() Stack → Boolean access item at the top of the stack test if the stack is empty fullStack() stark → Boolean test if the stack is full c) Using a stack to evaluate postfix Infix, prefix and posfix notation In most programming languages, mathematical expressions are written with the operator between the two operands, as in 1 + 2. This format is called infix. An alternative used by some calculators is called postfix. In postfix, the operator follows the operands, as in 1 2 +. Example: Let’s consider the following expression: x / y + 4*z  The prefix expression is: + / x y * 4 z  The postfix expression is: x y / 4 z * + The reason postfix is sometimes useful is that there is a natural way to evaluate a postfix expression using a stack: 1. Starting at the beginning of the expression, get one term (operator or operand) at a time. o If the term is an operand, push it on the stack. o If the term is an operator, pop two operands off the stack, perform the operation on them, and push the result back on the stack. 2. When you get to the end of the expression, there should be exactly one operand left on the stack. That operand is the result. d) Implementation of a stack Implementation of a stack can also be done using an array or a linked list IV.2.3 Binary Tree a) Abstract idea of a tree: A tree is another data structure that you can use to store information. Unlike stacks and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures. Here is an example of a tree holding letters: b) Tree Vocabulary Let's now introduce some vocabulary with our sample tree... The element at the top of the tree is called the root. The elements that are directly under an element are called its children. The element directly above something is called its parent. For example, a is a child of f and f is the parent of a. Finally, elements with no children are called leaves. A tree can be viewed, as a recursive data structure, for it is made up of subtrees c) Uses of trees (1) File systems A file system can be represented as a tree, with the top-most directory as the root. Here are some example of a folder structure in a windows explorer (2) expression tree An arithmetic expression can be represented by a tree the leave nodes are the variables/values the internal nodes are the operations (3) Organization chart (4) Family tree d) Binary Trees A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. For the rest of this example, we will enforce this to be the case. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child. e) Binary search tree A binary search tree (BST), sometimes also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:  The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.  The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.  The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.  There must be no duplicate nodes. The major advantage of binary search trees over other data structures is that the related sorting algorithms and search algorithms such as in-order traversal can be very efficient. Binary search trees are a fundamental data structure used to construct more abstract data structures such as sets, multisets, and associative arrays. f) Tree’s operations: As mentioned, there are different kinds of trees (e.g., binary search trees, 2-3 trees, AVL trees, tries, just to name a few). What operations we will need for a tree, and how they work, depends on what kind of tree we use. However, there are some common operations we can mention:  Add(): Places an element in the tree (where elements end up depends on the kind of tree).  Remove(): Removes something from the tree (how the tree is reorganized after a removal depends on the kind of tree).  IsMember: Reports whether some element is in the tree. Other operations may be necessary, depending on the kind of tree we use. g) Tree Traversals A tree traversal is a specific order in which to trace the nodes of a tree. To perform a traversal of a data structure, we use a method of visiting every node in some predetermined order. Traversals can be used  to test data structures for equality  to display a data structure  to construct a data structure of a give size  to copy a data structure There are 3 common tree traversals. 1. in-order: left, root, right 2. pre-order: root, left, right 3. post-order: left, right, root In order to illustrate few of the binary tree traversals, let us consider the below binary tree: 1) Preorder traversal: To traverse a binary tree in Preorder, following operations are carried-out (i) Visit the root, (ii) (iii) Traverse the left subtree, and Traverse the right subtree. Therefore, the Preorder traversal of the above tree will outputs: 15, 5, 3, 12, 10, 6, 7, 13, 16, 20, 18, 23 2) Inorder traversal: To traverse a binary tree in Inorder, following operations are carried out (i) (ii) (iii) Traverse the left most subtree starting at the left external node, Visit the root, and Traverse the right subtree starting at the left external node. Therefore, the Inorder traversal of the above tree will outputs: 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 23 3) Postorder traversal: To traverse a binary tree in Postorder, following operations are carried-out (i) Traverse all the left external nodes starting with the left most subtree which is then followed by bubble-up all the internal nodes, (ii) Traverse the right subtree starting at the left external node which is then followed by bubble-up all the internal nodes, and (iii) Visit the root. Therefore, the Postorder traversal of the above tree will outputs: 3, 7, 6, 10, 13, 12, 5, 18, 23, 20, 16, 15 Another example The 3 different types of traversal Pre-order Traversal FBADCEGIH In-order Traversal ABCDEFGHI Post-order Traversal ACEDBHIGF NB: The Preorder traversal of an expression tree give the prefix representation of the expression represented by the tree. The Inorder traversal of an expression tree give the infix representation of the expression represented by the tree. The postorder traversal of an expression tree give the postfix representation of the expression represented by the tree. Example: Let’s consider the following expression tree.  The preorder transversal is: + * + a b – a b 2  The inorder transversal is: a + b * a – b + 2  The postorder transversal is: a b + a b - * 2 + IV.2.4 Hash Tables A hash table (hash map) is a data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table is made up of two parts: an array (the actual table where the data to be searched is stored) and a mapping function, known as a hash function. The hash function provides a way for assigning numbers to the input data such that the data can then be stored at the array index corresponding to the assigned number. Let's take a simple example. First, we start with a hash table array of strings (we'll use strings as the data being stored and searched in this example). Let's say the hash table size is 10: Hash Table 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Next we need a hash function. There are many possible ways to construct a hash function. Some hash functions will take an integer key and turn it into an index. A common hash method is the division method. Let's say you had the following numbers or keys that you wanted to map into an array of 10 elements: 123456, 123467, 123450 To apply the division method, you could divide the number by 10 (or the maximum number of elements in the array) and use the remainder (the modulo) as an index. The following would result: 123456 % 10 = 6 (the remainder is 6 when dividing by 10) 123467 % 10 = 7 (the remainder is 7) 123450 % 10 = 0 (the remainder is 0) These numbers would be inserted into the array at positions 6, 7, and 0 respectively. It might look something like this: Case of non-integer keys For now, let's assume a simple hash function that takes a string as input. The returned hash value will be the sum of the ASCII characters that make up the string mod the size of the table: Again, the idea is that we will insert items into the hash table using the key and applying the hash function(s) to get the index. Placide --> 690 % 10 --> 0 Spark --> 593 % 10 --> 3 Steve --> 519 % 10 --> 9 A problem occurs when two keys yield the same index. For Instance, say we wanted to include: John --> 399 % 10 --> 9. We have a collision because Steve is already stored at array index 9. We need a method to resolve this. The resolution comes in how you create your hash table. In our case we will use linked list to solve the problem. Applications of a Hash Table Hash tables are good in situations where you have enormous amounts of data from which you would like to quickly search and retrieve information. A few typical hash table implementations would be in the following situations:  For driver's license record's. With a hash table, you could quickly get information about the driver (ie. name, address, age) given the licence number.  For internet search engines.  For telephone book databases. You could make use of a hash table implementatation to quickly look up John Smith's telephone number.  For electronic library catalogs. Hash Table implementations allow for a fast find among the millions of materials stored in the library.  For implementing passwords for systems with multiple users. Hash Tables allow for a fast retrieval of the password which corresponds to a given username. Advantages and disadvantages of hash tables Organization Advantages Disadvantages 9 Hash Table 0 123450 1 2 3 4 5 6 123456 7 123467 8 9 Hash Table 0 Placide 1 2 3 Spark 4 5 6 7 8 9 Steve, John Chaining  Unlimited number of elements  Unlimited number of collisions  Overhead of multiple linked lists Re-hashing  Fast re-hashing  Fast access through use of main table space  Maximum number of elements must be known  Multiple collisions may become probable Overflow area 1. Fast access 2. Collisions don't use primary table space  Two parameters which govern performance need to be estimated EXERCISES 1.

Give the sequence of values returned by the dequeue operation when this sequence of operations is performed on an initially empty FIFO queue. E A S * Y * Q U E * * * S T * * * I O * N * * * 9. Introduce int variables x and y and int* pointer variables p and q. Set x to 2, y to 8, p to the address of x, and q to the address of y. Then print the following information: (1) The address of x and the value of x. (2) The value of p and the value of *p. (3) The address of y and the value of y. (4) The value of q and the value of *q. (5) The address of p (not its contents!). (6) The address of q (not its contents!). XXIII. ALGORITHM STRATEGIES An algorithm strategy is a general approach to solve problems algorithmically. Although more than one technique may be applicable to a specific problem, it is often the case that an algorithm constructed by one approach is clearly superior to equivalent solutions built using alternative techniques. I.1 Examples of strategies 1. Brute Force Brute force is a straightforward approach to solve a problem based on the problem’s statement and definitions of the concepts involved. It is considered as one of the easiest approach to apply and is useful for solving small – size instances of a problem. Some examples of brute force algorithms are: Computing an (a > 0, n a nonnegative integer) by multiplying a*a*…*a, computing n!, Selection sort , Bubble sort, Sequential search 2. Greedy Algorithms "take what you can get now" strategy The solution is constructed through a sequence of steps, each expanding a partially constructed solution obtained so far. At each step the choice must be locally optimal – this is the central point of this technique. Examples: Minimal spanning tree, Shortest distance in graphs 3. Divide-and-Conquer, Decrease and conquer Also known as stepwise refinement, these are methods of designing algorithms that (informally) proceed as follows: Given an instance of the problem to be solved, split this into several smaller sub-instances (of the same problem), independently solve each of the sub-instances and then combine the sub-instance solutions so as to yield a solution for the original instance. With the divide-and-conquer method the size of the problem instance is reduced by a factor (e.g. half the input size), while with the decrease-and-conquer method the size is reduced by a constant. Examples of divide-and-conquer algorithms: Computing an by recursion, Binary search in a sorted array (recursion), Mergesort algorithm, Quicksort algorithm (recursion) Examples of decrease-and-conquer algorithms: Insertion sort, Topological sorting, Binary Tree traversals: inorder, preorder and postorder (recursion) 4. Transform-and-Conquer to These methods work as two-stage procedures. First, the problem is modified to be more amenable solution. In the second stage the solved. Example: consider the problem of finding the two closest numbers in an array of numbers. problem I.2 Design approaches is Different approaches are used to build an algorithm 1. Top-down design: Top-down approach is essentially the breaking down of a problem to gain insight into its compositional subproblems. Top-Down Technique logically progresses from the initial instance down to the smallest sub instance via intermediate sub-instances. 2. Bottom-up design: As you might guess, with this approach the details come first. It is the opposite of the top-down approach. In a Bottom-Up Technique, the smallest sub-instances are explicitly solved first and the results of these used to construct solutions to progressively larger sub-instances. XXIV. RECURSION A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. The main characteristics of a recursive algorithm are: - Stopping condition: It specifies the situation when the result can be obtained directly without the need of a recursive call. - Recursive call: The algorithm calls itself at least once. The value of the parameter corresponding to a cascade of calls should lead eventually to the stopping condition. II.1 An example of recursive function In general, problems that are defined in terms of themselves are good candidates for recursive techniques. The standard example used by many computer science textbooks is the factorial function. Let’s consider the problem of computing n! for n be a natural number. Starting from the definition of 𝑛! = 𝑛 × (𝑛 − 1) ×(𝑛 −2)×…×2×1, and applying the brute force technique (also known as iterative technique) we obtain the following algorithm. factorial(n) f ← 1 for i from n to 1 do f ← f * n endfor return f The factorial function describes the operation of multiplying a number by all the positive integers smaller than it. For example, 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 . And 9! = 9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 . We now see why factorial is often the introductory example for recursion: the factorial function is recursive, it is defined in terms of itself. Taking the factorial of n, we have: � �! = {1 � �𝑓 𝑛 = 0 𝑛 ∗(𝑛−1)! 𝑖𝑓 𝑛>0 Let's try writing our factorial function factorial(n). We want to code in the n! = n*(n - 1)! functionality. Easy enough: Let’s test it to make sure it is working properly factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2) = 3 * 2 * factorial(1) = 3 * 2 * 1 * factorial(0) = 3 * 2 * 1 * 1 II.2 Other examples of recursive functions a) The Fibonacci sequence The Fibonacci sequence is often used to illustrate the power of dynamic programming. The sequence is defined by the following recurrence relation: This very easily translates into a recursive function: Seems simple enough. What is the running time of Fibonacci()? Consider the call Fibonacci(4). You may remember from your study of binary trees that a nearly complete one, like the one above, has around 2n nodes, where n is the height of the tree (number of levels - 1). That means the number of function calls is around 2n, which is exponential given each function call is O(1). That's very expensive for such a simple little function! b) Power function Let consider the problem of computing xn for x>0 and n a natural number. Starting from the definition, � �𝑛=𝑥∗𝑥∗…∗𝑥=𝑥∗𝑥𝑛−1. Applying the brute force and the recursive techniques respectively, we have c) Hanoi’s tower Let’s consider three vertical pegs labelled as follows: src (source), dest (destination) and int (intermediate). On the src peg there are n disc placed in decreasing order of their diameter (the disc at the bottom is the largest one). We want to move all discs from the peg src to the rod dest by using int as intermediate peg such that the following constraints are satisfied. (i) On the destination peg the disc are placed in the same decreasing order (ii) A disc can never be placed on a smaller disc factorial(int n) if (n= 0)then f ← 1; else f ← n * factorial(n-1); endif return f F0 = 0 F1 = 1 Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 Fibonacci( n if ((n == 0) || (n == 1)) fib ← n; else fib ← Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2) return fib poxer1(real x, integer n) p ← 1 for i from 1 to n do p ← p * 1 endfor retun p poxer2(real x, integer n) if n= 0 then return 1 else retun x * power2(x, n-1) The basic idea of solving this problem is: “move n-1 disc from src to int using dest as intermediate peg; move the largest disc to src to dest; move the n-1 discs from int to dest using s as intermediate peg”. This idea is described very easy in a recursive algotithm hanoi(n,src,dest,int) if n = 1 then src → dest else hanoi(n-1,src,int,dest) src → dest hanoi(n-1,int,dest,src) endif II.3 Evaluation of a recursive function using stack The use of the stack is the best option in many system to execute recursive functions. During the program execution, as the function call itself, a stack of pointer(addresses of instructions of the caller function to which control must return after the called function is executed) is created in the memory. For example for the factorial function described above, the stact is shown below for n = 4 factorial( n) if (n > 0)then return(n * factorial(n-1)); else return(1) endif end Factor ial (0) = 1. Factorial(0) is not put in stack because it does not invoke any other function XXV. PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES There exist three main types of programming techniques: unstructured programming, structured programming and Object oriented programming. III.1 Unstructured programming Unstructured programming refers to writing small and simple programs, which consist of only one main program. All the actions such as providing input, processing and displaying output are done within one program only. This style of programming is generally restricted for developing a small application; but if the application becomes large, then it poses real difficulties in terms of clarity of the code, modifiability and ease of use. Although this type of programming style is not recommended, still most programmers start programming using this technique only. III.2 Structured programming The programs generated using unstructured approach are meant for simple and small problems. If the problem gets lengthy, this approach becomes too complex and obscure. After some time, even the programmers themselves may find it difficult to understand their own program. Hence, programming should be performed using a 'structured' (organized) approach. Figure. Structured Programming Using structured programming, a program is broken down into small independent tasks that are small enough to be understood easily, without having to understand the whole program at once. Each task has its own functionality and performs a specific part of the actual processing. These tasks are developed independently, and each task can carry out a specified function on its own. When these tasks are completed, they are combined together to solve the problem. III.2.1 Procedural programming This programming has a single program that is divided into small segments called procedures (also known as functions, routines, subroutines or methods). From the main or controlling procedure, a procedure call is used to invoke the required procedure. After the sequence is processed, the flow of control continues from the position from where the call was made. The main program coordinates calls to procedures and hands over appropriate data as parameters. The data are processed by the procedures and once the program has finished, the result data are displayed. a) Variable scope The scope of a variable is the region of code within which a variable is visible. Variable scoping helps avoid variable naming conflicts. The concept is intuitive: two functions can both have arguments called x without the two x‘s referring to the same thing. Similarly there are many other cases where different blocks of code can use the same name without referring to the same thing. Most programming languages support global and local scope with the newer programming languages also supporting block scope. Scope can vary by programming language so it is difficult to speak of scope in universal terms.  Local: These variables only exist inside the specific function that creates them. They are unknown to other functions and to the main program. As such, they are normally implemented using a stack. Local variables cease to exist once the function that created them is completed. They are recreated each time a function is executed or called.  Global: These variables can be accessed (ie known) by any function comprising the program. They are implemented by associating memory locations with variable names. They do not get recreated if the function is recalled. b) Passing arguments to functions We have different ways of passing parameter to function such as call by value and call by reference. Whenever we call a function, then sequence of executable statements get executed. We can pass some of the information to the function for processing called argument or parameter  Call by value: The value of a variable is sent to function. The actual parameter cannot be changed by function. copy going into the procedure. This is the mechanism used by both C and Java. Note that this mechanism is used for passing objects, where a reference to the objected is passed by value.  By-Reference When passing parameter using called by address scheme, we are passing the actual address of the variable to the called function. Any update made inside the called function will modify the original copy since we are directly modifying the content of the exact memory location. Illustration call by value Illustration call by reference Example procedure modify (input) begin input = "red" endfunct Algorithm begin x = "blue" modify(x) print(x) {"blue" indicates variable was passed by value, "red" indicates variable was passed by reference} end III.2.2 Modular programming Modular programming is the process of breaking down a problem into smaller independent tasks. These tasks can then be broken down into subtasks. Each module is designed to perform a specific function. Note that each module in itself is a small program, which can be compiled and tested individually and all modules are combined to build the whole program. Modular programming is an important and beneficial approach to programming problems. They make program development easier, and they can also help with future development projects. A module is a component of a larger system that interacts with the rest of the system in a simple and well-defined manner. Importance of modular programming a) Distributed development: By breaking down the problem into multiple tasks, different developers can work in parallel. And this will shorten the development time. b) Code reusability: A program module can be reused in programs. Modules or procedures can also be reused in future projects. c) Program readability: A program that has many functions is straightforward. But a program with no functions can be very long and hard to follow. d) Manageable tasks: Breaking down a programming project into modules makes it more manageable. These individual modules are easier to design, implement and test. e) Maintainability: An error in the system provide from a given module. It is then easier to maintain a single module than to maintain a whole program III.3 Object oriented Algorithms Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a style of programming that identifies and groups variables and modules into class objects. The class object represents a “thing” like a customer, a purchase, a payment and expresses each in terms of their data (state) and modules (behavior). The class object is stored in a file where it can then be accessed by the programs logic and more important be reused by other programs. A main platform of object-oriented programming is code reusability. Rather than starting from scratch with each new application, a programmer will consult libraries of existing components to see if any are appropriate as starting points for the design of a new application. Reusability is the ability of software elements to serve for the construction of many different applications. Benefits of Reusability     Reliability. Components built by specialists in their field are more likely to be designed correctly and reliably Efficiency. The component developers are likely to be experts in their field and will have used the best possible algorithms and data structures. Time Savings. By relying upon existing components there is less software to develop and hence applications can be built quicker. Decreased maintenance effort. Using someone else’s components decreases the amount of maintenance effort that the application developer needs to expend.  Consistency. Reliance on a library of standard components will tend to spread a consistency of design message throughout a team of programmers working on an application.  Investment. Reusing software will save the cost of developing similar software from scratch. OOP concepts Term Definition Aggregation Objects that are made up of other objects are known as aggregations. The relationship is generally of one of two types:  Composition – the object is composed of other objects. This form of aggregation is a form of code reuse. E.g. A Car is composed of Wheels, a Chassis and an Engine  Collection – the object contains other objects. E.g. a List contains several Items; A Set several Members. Attribute A characteristic of an object. Collectively the attributes of an object describe its state. E.g. a Car may have attributes of Speed, Direction, Registration Number and Driver. Class The definition of objects of the same abstract data type. In Java class is the keyword used to define new types. Encapsulation The combining together of attributes (data) and methods (behaviour/processes) into a single abstract data type with a public interface and a private implementation. This allows the implementation to be altered without affecting the interface. Inheritance The derivation of one class from another so that the attributes and methods of one class are part of the definition of another class. The first class is often referred to the base or parent class. The child is often referred to as a derived or sub-class. Derived classes are always ‘a kind of’ their base classes. Derived classes generally add to the attributes and/or behaviour of the base class. Inheritance is one form of object-oriented code reuse. E.g. Both Motorbikes and Cars are kinds of MotorVehicles and therefore share some common attributes and behaviour but may add their own that are unique to that particular type. Interface The behaviour that a class exposes to the outside world; its public face. Also called its ‘contract’. Method The implementation of some behaviour of an object. Message The invoking of a method of an object. In an object-oriented application objects send each other messages (i.e. execute each others methods) to achieve the desired behaviour. Object An instance of a class. Objects have state, identity and behaviour. Overloading Allowing the same method name to be used for more than one implementation. The different versions of the method vary according to their parameter lists. Polymorphism Giving an action one name that is shared up and down an object hierarchy, with each object in the hierarchy implementing the action in a way appropriate to itself. E.g. Both the Plane and Car types might be able to respond to a turnLeft message. While the behaviour is the same, the means of achieving it are specific to each type. XXVI. SOME STANDARD ALGORITHMS VI.1 Sorting algorithms A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. We can distinguish many sorting algorithms: Bubble sort , Insertion sort, Selection sort, Heapsort, Mergesort, Quick sort, … a. Selection sort The principle of Selection Sort is to find the smallest element of the data sequence (from index 0 to n-1) and put it to the beginning of the sequence. This procedure is then applied on the yet unsorted areas (1 to n-1, 2 to n-1 and so on), until the area from n-2 to n-1 has been sorted. Now the entire data sequence has been transformed to sorted form. To get the smallest element to the right position, simply exchange it with the first in the (sub-)sequence. Example: Unsorted Sequence 8 4 1 5 4 Step 1 8 4 1 5 4 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Result 1 4 8 5 4 1 4 8 5 4 1 4 4 5 8 1 4 4 5 8 Complexity analysis ALGORITHM for i ← 0 to n-2 do min ← i for j ← (i + 1) to n-1 do if A[j] < A[min] min ← j swap A[i] and A[min] Selection sort is not difficult to analyze compared to other sorting algorithms since none of the loops depend on the data in the array. Selecting the lowest element requires scanning all n elements (this takes n − 1 comparisons) and then swapping it into the first position. Finding the next lowest element requires scanning the remaining n − 1 elements and so on, for (n − 1) + (n − 2) + ... + 2 + 1 = n(n − 1) / 2 ∈ Θ(n2) comparisons (see arithmetic progression). Each of these scans requires one swap for n − 1 elements (the final element is already in place). b. Insertion sort The data sequence is divided into two sections: an already sorted target sequence and a still unsorted source sequence. The target sequence initially consists of the first element only. However, it grows by one element per iteration. In every iteration the first element of the current source sequence is compared with the elements of the target sequence in incremental order. If the first element of the source sequence is lower than or equal to an element of the target sequence, all elements to the left of the first element of the source sequence and to the right of the current element of the target sequence are moved to the right, the current element is inserted to the corresponding location in the target sequence and the iteration is stopped. Sorting is finished once all elements belong to the target sequence. ALGORITHM insertionSort(array A) begin for i := 1 to length[A]-1 do begin value := A[i]; j := i-1; while j ≥ 0 and A[j] > value do begin Complexity analysis Worst-case Complexity: 2 + 3 + 4 + … + n = n(n+1)/2 -1 = (n2)/2 + n/2 -1 = O(n2) (For reverse sorted array). Actual run time could be better (loop may terminate earlier than running for p-1 times! The best case scenario (sorted array as input): (n). c. Bubble sort The name of this algorithm is supposed to indicate that the elements "rise" like bubbles. All elements are compared with their successors; if the element with the lower index is the greater one, the elements are exchanged. Once the entire sequence has been processed this way, the whole process is repeated - until there's been an iteration during which no exchange took place. Then the data is sorted. Example (the elements that are currently compared with each other are in bold print): Complexity analysis Bubble Sort is very slow most of the time, except if the unsorted sequence actually is already sorted - then Bubble Sort works faster than the other algorithms: Already after one iteration (consisting of n-1 comparisons) it realizes that the sequence doesn't need to be sorted and stops. Complexity:  i=1n  j=i+1n 1 =  i=1n (n –i) = n2 – n(n+1)/2 = n2/2 – n/2 = (n2) d. Merge sort The unsorted sequence is divided into two sub-sequences. These, again, are divided into two sub sub-sequences, and so on. The smallest partitions consist of just one element each; thus, each of them can be regarded as sorted within its borders. Now neighbouring partitions are merged to larger sub-sequences (that's the source of the name of this algorithm), however not before the elements have been correctly ordered. The resulting sub-sequences are, again, merged until finally the entire data sequence has been reunited. A[j + 1] := A[j]; j := j-1; end; A[j+1] := value; end; end; Example (the target sequence is in bold): Unsorted Sequence 8 4 1 5 4 Step 1 8 4 1 5 4 Step 2 4 8 1 5 4 Step 3 1 4 8 5 4 Step 4 1 4 5 8 4 Result 1 4 4 5 8 Unsorted Sequence 8 4 1 5 4 Step 1 8 4 1 5 4 4 8 1 5 4 4 1 8 5 4 4 1 5 8 4 Step 2 4 1 5 4 8 1 4 5 4 8 => no exchange 1 4 5 4 8 1 4 4 5 8 => no exchange Step 3 1 4 4 5 8 => no exchange 1 4 4 5 8 => no exchange 1 4 4 5 8 => no exchange 1 4 4 5 8 => no exchange Result 1 4 4 5 8 ALGORITHM procedure bubbleSort(A:array) do swapped := false for i from 0 to n - 2 do: if A[i]> A[i+1] then swap(A[i], A[i+1]) swapped := true end if end for while swapped end procedure Example: Unsorted Sequence 8 4 1 5 4 Division 1 8 4 1 | 5 4 Division 2 Division 3 Merge 1 Merge 2 Merge 3 Result 8 4 | 1 | 5 | 4 8 | 4 | 1 | 5 | 4 4 8 | 1 | 5 | 4 1 4 8 | 4 5 1 4 4 5 8 1 4 4 5 8 Example Divide step ALGORITHM MergeSort (Array(First..Last)) Begin If Array contains only one element Then Return Array Else Mid= ((Last + First)/2) LHA = MergeSort(Array(First..Mid)) RHA = MergeSort(Array(Mid+1..Last)) ResultArray = Merge( LHA , RHA ) Return ResultArray EndIf End MergeSort Merge step e. Quicksort Quicksort is a fast and recursive sorting algorithm, which is used not only for educational purposes, but widely applied in practice. On the average, it has O(n log n) complexity, making quicksort suitable for sorting big data volumes. Algorithm The divide-and-conquer strategy is used in quicksort. Below the recursion step is described: 1. Choose a pivot value. The Pivot can be any value, which is in range of sorted values, even if it doesn't present in the array. 2. Partition. Rearrange elements in such a way, that all elements which are lesser than the pivot go to the left part of the array and all elements greater than the pivot, go to the right part of the array. Values equal to the pivot can stay in any part of the array. Notice, that array may be divided in non-equal parts. 3. Sort both parts. Apply quicksort algorithm recursively to the left and the right parts. The algorithm details are as follows: PARTITION(A, p, r) { x = A[r] // pivot: grab last element QUICKSORT(A, p, r) { if p < r i = p – 1 // index of last element ≤ pivot; initially before array for j = p to r-1 // inspect all elements but pivot { if A[j]  {  x // move only elements ≤ pivot to left region i = i + 1 swap A[i] and A[j] } { } } q = PARTITION(A, p, r) QUICKSORT(A, p, q-1) QUICKSORT(A, q+1, r) } swap A[i+1] and A[r] // put pivot in correct place return i+1 } Example VI.2 Searching algorithms Searching for data is one of the fundamental fields of computing. Often, the difference between a fast program and a slow one is the use of a good algorithm for the data set. 1) Linear searching A linear search is the most basic of search algorithm you can have. A linear search sequentially moves through your collection (or data structure) looking for a matching value. int function LinearSearch(Array A , int Lb, int Ub, int Key ); begin for i= Lb to Ub do if A [ i ]= Key then return i ; return –1; end; 2) Binary search binary search or half-interval search algorithm locates the position of an item in a sorted array. Binary search works by comparing an input value to the middle element of the array. The comparison determines whether the element equals the input, less than the input or greater. When the element being compared to equals the input the search stops and typically returns the position of the element. If the element is not equal to the input then a comparison is made to determine whether the input is less than or greater than the element. Comparison Recursive algorithm BinarySearch(A[0..N-1], value, low, high) { if (high < low) return -1 // not found mid = low + ((high - low) / 2) if (A[mid] > value) return BinarySearch(A, value, low, mid-1) else if (A[mid] < value) return BinarySearch(A, value, mid+1, high) else return mid // found } Iterative algorithm BinarySearch(A[0..N-1], value) { { low = 0 high = N - 1 while (low <= high) mid = low + ((high - low) / 2) if (A[mid] > value) high = mid - 1 else if (A[mid] < value) low = mid + 1 else return mid // found } return -1 // not found } Insertion Sort:  Average Case / Worst Case : Θ(n2) ; happens when input is already sorted in descending order  Best Case : Θ(n) ; when input is already sorted  No. of comparisons : Θ(n2) in worst case & Θ(n) in best case  No. of swaps : Θ(n2) in worst/average case & 0 in Best case Selection Sort:  Average Case / Worst Case / Best Case: Θ(n2)  No. of comparisons : Θ(n2)  No. of swaps : Θ(n2) in worst/average case & 0 in best case Merge Sort :  Average Case / Worst Case / Best case : Θ(nlgn) ; doesn't matter at all whether the input is sorted or not  No. of comparisons : Θ(n+m) in worst case & Θ(n) in best case ; assuming we are merging two array of size n & m where n=N. i.e. f is big –O of g if there is c such that f is not larger than cg for sufficiently large value of n ( greater than N) c g(n) is an upper bound on the value of f(n). That is, the number of operations is at worst proportional to g(n) for all large values of n.

                BIOGEOGRAPHY 
                MODULE 3: UNDERSTANDING AND MANAGING BIOGEOGRAPHIC ZONES 
                ACROSS THE WORLD IN GENERAL AND CAMEROON IN PARTICULAR 
                Biogeography is a combined word derived from two words “biology” (the study of living things) 
                and “geography” (the study of spatial variations in the contents of space through time. Thus 
                biogeography is the study of the spatial variation in the distribution of and characteristics of 
                ,living things and the relationship with the natural environment. 
                Biogeography has two subfields i.e. phytogeography (the study of plants) and zoogeography (the 
                study of animals). In both cases, biogeography seeks to describe and to explain the spatial 
                variations in their distribution, characteristics and in the relationship which exists between biotic 
                and non biotic components. 
                TOPIPC: SOIL AND ITS PROPERTIES 
                Lesson 1: The Soil 
                A. Meaning  
                In its simplest form, soil refers to the thin surface layer resting on the earth’s crust made up of a 
                complex mixture of mineral particles, organic matter, water and air formed by physical, chemical 
                and biological processes. Mature soils have an internal organization and arrangement from the 
                surface to the unbroken rock layer below. This organisatioon is known as a soil profile which 
                usually consists of three layer5s called horizons. 
                B. Soil Components and variation with depth 
                These are the substances that make up soil. A mature soil consists of four basic components i.e. 
                mineral matter, organic matter, air and water.

                i. Mineral matter: This consists of broken rock particles of various sizes such as clay, silt 
                and sand. They are derived from the weathering of rocks and makes up a large proportion 
                of soil (about 40%). It provides the mineral nutrients required by plants. It increases with 
                depth because it is derived from breakdown of bedrock below. Its composition in the soil 
                affects soil characteristics like texture, colour, structure and fertility. 
                ii. Organic matter: This consists of decomposed remains of plant and animal material called 
                humus as well as micro organisms that live in soils. Organic matter makes up a small 
                proportion of the soil (only 15%) and the volume decreases with depth since it is derived 
                from materials on the surface. It subtypes include; 
                 Mull humus: It is well decomposed finely divided organics matter which is intimately mixed 
                with mineral matter especially clay with which it forms a clay-humus complex. They are 
                commonly formed in well drained soils like the grassland areas. 
                 Mor humus: It is partly decomposed organic matter usually found in cold areas and develops 
                best beneath coniferous forest and heath land plant with extremely acid conditions. 
                 Moder humus: It is intermediate between mor and mull humus and consists of fairly 
                decomposed organic matter with a thin layer of litter remains clearly visible on the surface 
                with a layer of partly decayed material beneath it. It develops best under deciduous 
                woodland., 
                 Peat: It is a layer of raw humus formed in areas of low temperature and/or poor drainage. 
                iii. Air: These are the gases that occupy the pore spaces between soil particles. They include 
                carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen. These gases are derived from the atmosphere and 
                15%

                organic matter pores of air and water mineral matter
                some released by the organisms that live in the soil. It volume decreases with depth as the 
                soil becomes more compact. It is rich in carbon dioxide and poorer in oxygen 
                iv. Water: It occupies the pores between soil particles and derived from the atmosphere during 
                rainfall and from ground water below. It makes up about 45% of the soil’s volume and its 
                depth is fairly constant. Three types of soil water can be distinguished as follows; 
                 Gravitational water: It is water which occupies the macro pores but drain rapidly after rain. 
                This type is not available for plant use but rather facilitates leaching of nutrients. 
                 Capillary water: It is water in the micro pores and readily available for plant use. 
                 Hygroscopic water: It is a thin film of water that is tightly held around fine soil particles 
                (e.g. clay) by surface tension against the force of gravity. It is not available for plant use. 
                NB: The maximum amount of water a soil can hold is known a field capacity. This occurs when 
                the micro pores are filled although the macro pores are empty or filled by air. 
                C. Importance of soil to man and biosphere 
                 Soil is an integral part of the ecosystem i.e. air, water and soil comprise the various 
                ecosystems of the earth. 
                 They provide a substance (support) for plants, a medium within which their roots can take 
                anchorage.  
                 Soils are a source of nutrients and water for vegetation and the rest of the ecosystem. i.e. it 
                provides nutrients to plants which are finally eaten by animals. This explains the food chain 
                where only plants that depend on the soil are producers. 
                 It also acts as a home or habitat for many of the organisms involved in the cycling of 
                nutrients through the ecosystem. 
                 To an engineer, soil is an earthly material that can be extracted for uses such as road beds, 
                septic tanks, and drain fields, dwellings with basements or recreation facilities. Soil also 
                forms construction material especially for mud wall houses. 
                 Soil is the domain of archeology. Soils can reveal information about ancient climates, 
                geology and people. Archeologists study ancient habitats, dwellings, and other cultural 
                factors by examining soils. 
                D. The Soil System 
                Soil is an open system because it involves inputs, processes and outputs. The diagram below 
                illustrates the main aspects of the soil system.

                Inputs   
                Outputs   
                a. Inputs: These are the materials and energy that enter the soil body. They include; 
                1. Atmospheric inputs such as; - 
                Water from the atmosphere through precipitation 
                Gases from the atmosphere and from the respiration of soil organisms. 
                2. Geological inputs such asa - 
                Mineral nutrients e.g. calcium, potassium, iron, etc released into the soil from the 
                weathering of bedrock below. 
                Soil particles or sediments transported from upslope and deposited by agents of erosion 
                or from the accumulation of volcanic material in volcanic regions. 
                3. Biological inputs such as; - 
                Organic matter embracing litter, humus and organic nutrients derived from decaying 
                plants and animal tissues as well as soil organisms. 
                4. Artificial inputs such as 
                4 
                
                
                5 
                - Chemical fertilizers and manure applied by farmers. 
                
                b. Processes  
                These are the activities which take place in the soil. They are;  
                 Nutrient cycling i.e. the nutrients that get into the soil, are taken up by plants and later 
                release back to the soil when the plants die and decompose. 
                 Leaching i.e. water that gets into the soil dissolves and washes downward the soluble 
                minerals or elements found in the soil as water percolates. Depending on the mineral 
                removed, leaching could be described as ferrallitisation (i.e. if silica is removed leaving 
                behind iron and aluminum) or podsolization (i.e. if iron and aluminum oxides are removed). 
                 Capillarity i.e. the upward movement of water in the soil especially in dry areas and brings 
                up minerals from the lower layers to the upper layers of soil. This increases soil fertility. 
                 Eluviation i.e. when some of the water moving through the soil washes out fine soil material 
                in suspension (not in solution) from the A horizon. 
                 Illuviation i.e. the material removed from the top soil by sinking water is redeposited in the 
                lower layer (B horizon) of the same soil. 
                 Organic matter decomposition i.e. it occurs when micro-organisms in the soil break down 
                the waste matter to form humus, in a process called humification and some of the organic 
                matter is converted into minerals in a process called mineralization. 
                c. Outputs 
                The actions or processes that take place in the soil cause some of the products to be carried away 
                or leave the soil as outputs. They include; - Heat lost to the atmosphere through re-radiation - Water lost to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration or to ground store via 
                percolation - Nutrients lost through leaching and through flow - Soil particles lost through soil creep and erosion - Peat lost through extraction for fuel (by man). 
                Lesson 2: Physical Properties of the Soil 
                These are qualities of the soil that can be used to describe the soil and to know if it’s good or 
                poor for agriculture. These characteristics are both physical (texture, structure, colour, and depth) 
                and chemical (acidity and fertility).

                I. Soil Texture 
                A. Meaning  
                This refers to the sizes and relative amounts of the various mineral particles such as sand, silt and 
                clay that make up the soil. These mineral particles originate from the weathering of rocks. 
                B. Textural classes.  
                On the basis of the amount of sand, silt and clay present in every given soil type, soil can be 
                classified into twelve textural classes notably; sand, silt, clay, loam, sandy loam, sandy clay 
                loam, loam sand, sandy clay, silty laom, silty clay loam, clay loam and silty clay. 
                 Clay soils: If a soil has about 40% of clay particles and small amounts of sand and silt, it is 
                described as having a clay texture. Clay particles are the smallest with diameter of less than 
                0.002mm. Clay soils attract nutrients and hold water for plant use but form sticky and heavy 
                soils that make tilling or ploughing difficult. 
                 Sandy soils: If sand dominates (about 85% and above) in a soil type, it is described as sandy 
                in texture. Sand particles ranges from 0.02mm to 2mm in diameter. 
                 Silty soils: If silt is more than 80%, the soil is described as silty soils. Silt particles ranges 
                from 0.002mm to 0.02mm in diameter. Silt and sandy soils do not retain nutrients and are dry 
                especially sand but are light to till. Silt hold some water. 
                 Loam soils: These are soils that have almost the same amount of sand, silt and clay. They are 
                the best soils for agriculture because it combines the positive and aspects of the different 
                mineral particles of clay, silt and sand. 
                C. Determination (Field and Laboratory methods) 
                1. The feel method: This method estimates particle sizes of the soil through the characteristics 
                of the individual particles. For example, sand feels gritty and uncohesive i.e. the particles are 
                rough and loose.  Silt feels slippery, soapy or silky and smooth. Clay on its part is plastic and 
                sticky when wet and can roll into balls with smooth surfaces when rubbed. That which sticks 
                to the fingers to some extent and difficult to be moulded into threads but will not bend into a 
                small ring it is loam. 
                2. The Sieve method: This involves the use of sieves of different meshes to separate the 
                various grains or particles of a collected dry soil sample. The proportion of each of the 
                
                
                7 
                
                particles separated can then be weighed and expressed as a percentage of the total weight 
                initially collected. 
                3. The sedimentation method: This involves the use of a transparent container or beaker of 
                water to separate the soil particles. In this light, a preferably dry soil sample is collected and 
                poured into the container, well shaken for the grains to detach from each other and allowed to 
                settle. The general tendency is that the largest particles (sand) because of weight would settle 
                first at the bottom, followed by moderate sized particles (silt), while the fine particles (clay) 
                would settle last at the top. 
                D. Representation Techniques  
                Diagrammatically, soil texture is conventionally represented by means of triangular graph 
                (ternary diagram) with each particle plotted on one of the three sides. Each side is thus graduated 
                from 0 to 100 so that the texture of any soil is determined by the line intersection of percentages 
                of each of the particles drawn parallel to their zero lines. 
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                From the diagram above, the composition of the texture at point A is; clay 20%, silt 70% and 
                sand 10%. At B there is 60% of clay, 30% of silt and 10% sand. Sample A’s textural class is silt 
                loam (because it lies within the zone of silt loam), while B is clay soil (it lies within the boundary 
                of clay). 
                E. Factors affecting soil texture  
                A 
                B 
                C 
                a. Nature of rocks: Rocks with small grains such as basalt would form clay soils while rocks 
                made up of large crystals such as sandstone would form sandy soils. 
                b. Type of weathering: Chemical weathering grinds rocks into very fine clay while physical 
                weathering produces coarse-textured soils. 
                c. Human activities: Over ploughing of soils leads to reduction in the sizes of the particles. 
                F. Significance or importance of soil texture  
                 It determines the amount of water the soil can hold for plant use. 
                 It also determines the amount of nutrients retained in soil for plant use. E.g. clay soils have 
                negative electrical charges and tend to attract and hold nutrients which are positively 
                charged. 
                 Texture also determines the ease with which soils can be tilled. Sandy soils are easy to till 
                than clay soils which are heavy when wet and hard when dry. 
                Practical Work 1: Determining Soil Texture 
                 In the field: In the school locality, use the feeling, moulding and ringing methods to 
                determine soil texture 
                 In the Laboratory: The samples collected measure the proportion of each particle size using 
                sieving method and establish the soil textural classes. Plot them on a ternary graph. 
                Lesson 3: Soil Structure 
                A. Meaning and types 
                Soil structure refers to the shape of the various clumps or soil pieces formed by the binding 
                together (aggregation) of various soil particles. These soil particles rarely occur in isolation but 
                are bound together into aggregates or clumps called peds. There are six types of soil structures as 
                follows; 
                a. Crumb structure: It consists of small uniformly shaped spherical peds similar to bread 
                crumbs of between 1 – 5mm in diameter. They are porous and well drained and aerated. They 
                allow root penetration thus good for agriculture. They develops under grass and common in 
                the A horizon of loam soil such as the chernozems and tropical black earth. 
                b. Granular structure: They are similar to crumb in size and shape but not porous. They have 
                relatively low agricultural value because they are not well aerated. They are mostly common 
                in the A horizon of clay soils. 
                c. Blocky structure: It consists of irregularly shaped peds of almost equal length and width (10 – 75mm in diameter) with more or less sharp corners. They allow water movement but can 
                8 
                hinder plants growth if tightly packed. Ferruginous soils, tundra soils and regosols may have 
                this structure. 
                d. Platy structure: It consists of flat peds which are aligned horizontally. It is common in B 
                horizon of clay soils and soils that have been flattened by farm tractors or trampling. This 
                structure restricts water movement and root penetration and so, low agricultural value. 
                e. Prismatic structure: They are made up of vertically elongated peds with planner or flat 
                surfaces. It is commonly found in the subsoil of clay soils which have been affected by 
                shrinkage or swelling. Their vertical alignment allows for soil water movement and plant 
                growth. 
                f. 
                Columnar structure: It is similar to prismatic but has rounded top due to slaking. It also 
                allows vertical movement of soil water and plant root penetration. 
                B. Factors affecting or influencing soil structure  
                 Soil texture: Soils with a relatively or almost equal amount of sand, silt and clay particles 
                will develop a crumb structure. This is typical with loam soils especially at the A horizons of 
                Chernozems and tropical black earth. 
                 Organic matter content: The presence of organic matter in the soil will lead to the 
                development of a crumby structure. This is because microorganisms finds it easier to break 
                down litter into humus thereby giving rise to small uniformly shaped spherical peds 
                (crumbs).  
                 Man’s activities: Human activities like ploughing using machines/tractors will easily lead to 
                the development of a platy structure with peds aligning horizontally. 
                C. Importance of Soil structure 
                 It determines the level of porosity of the soil. For example, crumby structure soils are well 
                drained and aerated. 
                 It also influences the level of plant growth i.e. if a soil is suitable foir agriculture. For 
                example, crumby structured soils are good for agriculture unlike granular structured soils 
                which are poorly drained and aerated. 
                Lesson 4: Soil Depth (Thickness) 
                A. Meaning 
                This is the thickness of a soil from the surface to the bedrock. The depth of the soil in any area 
                varies from a few centimetres to metres depending on the nature of bedrock, the slope of the 
                land, speed of disintegration of mineral matter, the length of time taken to develop, nature of 
                9 
                climate and the nature of vegetation cover. A soil may be deep, thin or skeletal. Deep soils can 
                support tubers such as cassava and yams, while thin soils are poor for farming. 
                B. Factors affecting soil depth/thickness 
                a. The nature of parent rock: Less resistant rocks can easily be weathered to form thick soils 
                than more resistant rocks like granite. 
                b. Slope of the land or slope gradient: Steep slopes experience high rates of erosion and as a 
                result, the soils are shallow. On gentle slopes, there is surface accumulation or deposition 
                leading to deeper soils. 
                c. The type of climate: Warm and moist climatic conditions favour rapid and deep chemical 
                weathering. This results in deep soils e.g. ferrallitic soils. Hot dry or cold climatic conditions 
                slow chemical weathering. Thus leading to thin soils e.g. desert soils. 
                d. Length of time the soil has been developing: The longer the time the soil has been 
                developing, the greater the depth because everything being equal, such soils will witness 
                greater rates of weathering, surface accumulation or greater inputs from the vegetation. 
                e. Nature of vegetation cover: The type and density of vegetation also determines soil 
                development. For example, dense vegetation cover will provide more organic matter that 
                after decomposition, will increase soil depth. 
                Lesson 5: Chemical Properties of the Soil 
                I. Soil Colour 
                A. Meaning  
                Soils have different colours as some are black, while others are reddish-brown and grey in 
                colour. The colour of every given soil type is determined by: 
                 Colour of minerals that make up the soil. For example, iron compounds give reddisih
                brown colour e.g. ferrallitic soils found in southern part of Cameroon. While the absence 
                of iron gives soils a grey colour e.g. podzols found in Sweden. 
                 Organic matter content of the soil. For instance, humus gives soil a black colour 
                 Drainage conditions also determine soil colour. Well drained soils are exposed to 
                oxidation and take a reddish-brown colour. Conversely, poorly drained soils often have a 
                greyish colour due to reduction e.g. gley soils. 
                B. Significance of soil colour - 
                It determines soil fertility  - 
                Soil pH can easily be determined. 
                10 
                
                
                11 
                
                
                
                II. Soil pH 
                A. Meaning  
                This refers to the degree or scale or the standard measure of acidity and alkalinity of the soil 
                based on the concentration of hydrogen ions activity in soil particles or colloids expressed in 
                grams per litre. I.e. it expresses the concentration of free ions of hydrogen in soil. A soil can be 
                described as either acidic (pH value below 7) alkaline (pH value of more than 7) and neutral (pH 
                value of 7). A lithmus paper or pH meter can be used to determine the degree of soil acidity. 
                B. Factors affecting soil pH 
                 Parent material: The mineral content of most rocks depends on the chemical components of 
                the parent rocks that is the basis of soil development. 
                 Vegetation type: Acidic vegetation like the temperate coniferous forest provides organic 
                matter which is acidic. These materials after decomposing increase the degree of acidity of 
                the soil. 
                 Climate: Climate affects the pH value through precipitation, temperatures and its influence 
                on plant growth. High rainfall will increase rate of leaching and soil erosion. This then 
                reduces the rate of acidity since some of the acidic materials are carried away in water. 
                Lesson 6: Soil Fertility  
                A. Meaning  
                This is the ability of a soil to supply enough nutrients and water for plant growth and high yield. 
                This ability depends on the macro nutrients (i.e. those needed in great quantities by plants e.g. 
                CO2, O2, Nitrogen, Calcium, Potassium, Phosphorous, Sulphur and Magnessium) and micro 
                nutrients (i.e. those required in small quantities e.g. Manganese, iron, silica, chlorine, zinck, etc.) 
                B. Factors influencing soil fertility 
                 Soil texture: Coarse texture soils like stones, gravel and sand will allow water to pass 
                through leading to leaching. This reduces soil minerals and soil fertility. Thus such soils 
                cannot hold soil minerals leading to low fertility. 
                 Soil structure: Crumby soils are fertile ad compared to platy, prismatic or columnar. This is 
                because the crumby soils are fine and can store much water and minerals for plant uptake. 
                These soils are finer and can allow plants roots to penetrate. 
                 Chemical composition of rocks: Soils with minerals like sulphur, potassium, sodium, 
                calcium, which are macro nutrient will increase the fertility of the soil. The absence of these 
                minerals will make soils infertile. 
                 Climate: This is seen through the elements of weather and climate. Low rainfall will cause 
                droughts especially when temperatures are high. This will harden the soils making it difficult 
                for plants to grow. High temperature will also cause high rates of evapotranspirtation       
                thereby reducing the amount of soil moisture. 
                 PH value of the soil: Soil pH determines the availability of nutrients in the soil. At low pH 
                (acidic soils), minerals are very loose in the soil and can be easily eroded or leached. While 
                at high pH, the soils are alkalinic and minerals are not made available to plant roots. 
                 Vegetation cover: Vegetation cover will intercept rainfall to reduce the intensity of rainfall 
                on to the surface and its impacts on soil erosion, hold soils firm through the roots to reduce 
                soil erosion and provide organic matter needed for soil development. This shows the 
                importance of vegetation to soil development. 
                 Drainage: Drainage is related to the presence of water. This may come from high rainfall to 
                cause leaching and soil erosion. These will reduce soil fertility. Floods along river valleys 
                bring in alluvial materials that make soils more fertile. 
                 Man’s activities: Man’s influence through over cropping, overgrazing, bush fires, 
                deforestation, and cultivation along slopes will expose the soils to soil erosion, remove soil 
                minerals through plant uptake or kill the soil bacteria that facilitate soil development. This 
                will negative affect soil fertility. On the other hand, man can improve on soil fertility by 
                providing chemical fertilisers, practicing mulching, crop rotation, contour ploughing, etc. 
                Importance of soil fertility - 
                It facilitates plant growth 
                TOPIC: SOIL DEVELOPMENT 
                Lesson 7: Soil Formation/Development 
                Although soils can be destroyed in a short while, it takes a long time (hundreds and thousands of 
                years) for a mature soil to be formed. 
                A. Stages in soil formation 
                There are three main stages involved in the formation of a particular soil type. These stages are; 
                12 
                 The first stage is the weathering of bedrock to produce a layer of broken material called 
                regolith. This provides the mineral materials from which soils eventually develop. 
                 The second stage is the addition of organic matter to the mineral particles. This occurs 
                through decomposition and integration of plant and animal remains by soil organisms. 
                 The third and final stage is that of reorganization and redistribution of the various soil 
                constituents into horizons. This is achieved by bacterial mixing and translocation (i.e. the 
                movement of fine and soluble soil material in various directions within the soil by the aid of 
                soil water). 
                B. Factors of Soil Formation 
                Soil formation is influenced by five main factors. These have been expressed by an American 
                soil expert, H. Jenny in the following equation; 
                S = f (Cl, O, R, P, T). where; 
                S stands for Soil, f for function of the following factors: Cl is climate, O is organisms, R is 
                relief, P is parent material and T is time. 
                 Active factors  
                1. Climate: It influences soil development both directly and indirectly  - - - - 
                Climate influences the weathering of rocks to form regolith. Warm and moist climatic 
                conditions like in equatorial region cause rapid chemical weathering, which eventually 
                produces deep and clay-textured soils. Dry and cold/hot climatic conditions favour physical 
                weathering which produces thin and coarse-textured soils. 
                Climate also influences the rate of decomposition of organic matter to form humus. This 
                forms the upper layers of soil and give its black colour. 
                Climate determines the intensity and direction of translocation or movement of soil material. 
                This gives rise to different layers or horizons. In hot humid climates, there is leaching leading 
                to infertile soils while the reverse is true for dry climatic areas. 
                Climate also indirectly affects soil by influencing the types of plants and animals present in 
                an area. These in turn provides organic matter and nutrients to the soil. 
                2. Organisms or biological activity: This refers to the contribution of living things to soil 
                formation. Plants, soil organisms and man influence soil formation in the following ways; - 
                Soil organisms such as bacteria help in decomposition of organic matter and mixing of the 
                soil. Some secrete digestive enzymes which act as gums to bind soil particles together to 
                form soil structure. Others fix nutrients in the soil (nitrogen fixing bacteria) 
                13 
                - - 
                Man adds nutrients in the soil by application of fertilizers and organic manure. However, 
                man can also destroy the soil by over cultivation, deforestation, etc. 
                Plant roots and humic acid from decomposing plant material assist in the biological 
                breakdown of rocks to form regolith. Plants also provides much of the litter which 
                decomposes to form humus. This adds to plant nutrients to the soil and also change soil 
                colour. 
                 Passive factors  
                3. Relief: Relief through aspect, gradient and height cause differences in soil along slope called 
                soil catena. Deep and fertile soils develop on lowlands with gentle slopes while soils upslope 
                are thin due to rapid loss by erosion and landslides. 
                4. Parent material: This is the bedrock or deposited rock materials from which soils eventually 
                develop. Rocks with large grains or crystals such as sandstone produces sandy soils while 
                rocks with small grains like basalts produces clay soils. 
                5. Time: Time is necessary for the soil to fully develop. If there is limited time, the 
                characteristics of the soils will entirely be those inherited from the parent material. Such soils 
                are called young or azonal soils e.g. alluvial soils. While soils which have existed for long 
                have well defined horizons and are well developed. 
                Lesson 8: Soil Profile 
                A. Meaning 
                A soil profile is the vertical section of a soil from the surface to the bedrock below showing its 
                different horizons or layers. The horizons have differences in colour, texture, structure and 
                chemical characteristics. The soil profile of a well-developed soil can be divided into three main 
                horizons namely: the A, B and C horizons. 
                B. The ideal soil profile (horizons) 
                1. A-Horizon or topsoil: It is the top soil or uppermost part of the soil on which the roots of 
                small plants anchor. This is rich in organic matter and so often dark in colour. Biological 
                activities are high here. Leaching and eluviation are equally high here and for this reason it is 
                called the eluvial horizon. This layer is also vulnerable to wind and water erosion. For easy 
                understanding, this layer is subdivided into the following: 
                 Organic layer: It is labelled O and consist of Aoo or litter layer designated L and made up 
                of an accumulation of undecomposed plant remains. Next to this is the Ao or fermentation 
                14

                 Another sub layer labeled A3 may occur, though not in all cases, below it as a transitional 
                zone that grades into the B horizon. 
                2. B-Horizon or Subsoil: It is light in colour due to less organic matter. It is the zone of 
                accumulation of minerals removed from the A-horizon thus, it is described as the illuviation 
                zone. It is the layer in which the roots of big trees occur. It is subdivided into: 
                 Its upper surface is occasionally represented by a stained transitional zone that indicates 
                the beginning of the accumulation of humus stained colloids and often designated as B1 
                or Bh. 
                 Below this is the actual zone of illuviation with a light to brown colour often labelled as 
                B2 or as Bs if sesquioxides of iron and aluminum have accumulated. 
                 Another sub layer is B3 may occasionally be found that grades into the C horizon.  
                NB: The two horizons (A and B) are considered the true soil layer and called Solum. 
                3. The C horizon: This is the last layer at the base. It is made up of weathered material that lies 
                on the bedrock. It is purely mineral in composition without any traces of organic matter. The 
                characteristics of this layer are entirely inherited from the parent material. Below this lies the 
                little-unaltered parent material which is relatively unchanged.

                Lesson 9: Major Pedogenic Regimes  
                A. Meaning 
                Pedogenic regimes are special soil forming processes which occur only under specific climatic 
                conditions to give rise to specific soil types. It also refers basic ways in which soil develops as 
                conditioned by specific environmental conditions, especially climatic and biological conditions. 
                The various pedogenic regimes are as seen below: 
                1. Podzolisation or Cheluviation: It involves the downward removal of sesquioxides (iron and 
                aluminum) and other bases while silica remains in the topsoil. This give rise to the characteristic 
                ash-grey coloured soils known as podzols where leaching is more intensive, and brown earth 
                where leaching of iron compounds is fairly less intensive. It occurs in cold humid temperate 
                climatic regions characterized by long cold winters and short summers.

                This pedogenic regime arises due to very low temperatures of most parts of the year which 
                restrict biota activity. Litter consisting of remains of conifers and heathland vegetation is partly

                Figure: Podzolisation 
                decomposed to form raw acidic humus (mor humus). Under such conditions, iron and aluminum 
                compounds become soluble and easily leached while silica become insoluble and left behind. 
                The removal of iron colouring agents gives the top soil an ash-grey colour while its illuviation in 
                the subsoil gives the B horizon a reddish-brown colour. 
                2. Laterisation or Ferrallitisation or Latolisation: It is the pedogenic regime of the humid 
                tropical areas where temperatures are constantly high and rainfall heavy and fairly evenly spread 
                throughout the year or concentrated for most of the year. This process involves the downward 
                removal of silica and other bases leaving behind insoluble sesquioxides of iron and aluminum in 
                the topsoil. This results in red ferrallitic soil of the humid tropics with rainfall for all of year and 
                ferruginous soils of wet and dry savannah regions. 
                Precipitation exceeds evaporation

                Oxides of Fe and Al 
                remain 
                Loss of Si and bases 
                Figure: Ferrallitisation 
                This originates from the fact that in the humid tropics, litter is rapidly decomposed due to the 
                warm moist climatic conditions. This releases bases which reduce the degree of soil acidity. 
                Rapid chemical weathering which produces clay is also favoured which later breakdown to form 
                silica and sesquioxides. Under such conditions, iron and aluminum compounds becomes 
                insoluble and remain at the top while silica is leached out. These oxides of iron and aluminum 
                may become so abundant as to form hard-rock like masses called laterite which is difficult to 
                plough and to be penetrated by plant roots. 
                3. Calcification: It occurs in semi-arid areas where evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation or 
                at times slightly in balance. It is a typical characteristic of temperate continental climate such as 
                the steppes and fringes of tropical hot deserts. Calcification involves the accumulation of calcium 
                17 
                carbonate in the soil drawn up from the layers or parent material by capillary action. This gives 
                rise to lime-rich fertile soils such as chernozem and tropical black earth.

                Upward movement of 
                bases 
                Figure: Calcification 
                This results from the insufficient rainfall to leach out the colloids and bases so that they remain 
                in the A horizon. The limited leaching is only able to flush salts from making the soil saline and 
                because evaporation exceeds precipitation, water is drawn upward by capillarity and evaporates. 
                This results to precipitation of calcium in the B horizon and this calcium may be abundant to 
                form nodules or stony layer (calcrete). Bacteria action is greater on grass litter and humus so 
                form is not leached and also develop into a thick black layer and together with the high level of 
                bases give a fertile soil. 
                4. Salinisation or Alkalisation: It is a regime common in arid areas (deserts) where 
                evapotranspiration greatly exceeds precipitation and occurs mainly in the wetter parts such as 
                oases or where the water table is near the surface. It is the process of upward movement and 
                accumulation of salts in the upper layers of the soil. It increases soil alkalinity thus called 
                alkalinisation and because of excess evaporation over precipitation, water is drawn upward 
                including salt solution of potassium (k) and sodium (Na) from the parent rock or saline water 
                18 
                table along the capillary pores and precipitated at or near the surface as water evaporates. 
                Sometimes this salt concentrate on the surface giving rise to hard pan or salt crust which hinders 
                plant growth thus saline desert soils are formed.

                5. Gleization or Gleying: It occurs in poorly drained or water logged environments anywhere 
                but more especially under moist cold climates of temperate and sub-polar regions (Tundra). It is 
                the process of the reduction of iron compounds by microorganisms in waterlogged soils. This 
                produces a grey or bluish soil called gley or glei soil. This process arises as a result of excess 
                water which prevents atmospheric oxygen from getting in touch with soil elements. Such 
                anaerobic conditions favour the growth of specialized bacteria which (by using up any available 
                oxygen) reduce the initial reddish coloured oxidized iron (iron III) called ferric iron to soluble 
                ferrous iron (iron II) which is grey-blue in colour.   Sometimes, pockets of air reoxygenise the 
                iron II to give patches of red mottles within the profile. This is usually associated with periodic 
                drying out of the soil. 
                19 
                Also, the impeded drainage conditions and sometimes low temperature restrict biota activity that 
                result in a layer of poorly decomposed organic matter (peaty layer) on the surface. Thus gleying 
                is a process that leads to the formation of soil consisting of a peaty layer on the surface and a 
                greyish-blue coloured layer commonly referred to as glei-horizon within the sone of ground 
                water saturation.

                Lesson 10: Minor Soil Forming Processes  
                1. Weathering: It is the process that give rise to the C horizon, which is the foundation of soil 
                profiles. It involves the gradual physical disintegration and the chemical decomposition of rocks 
                in situ, into minute particles. The layer of broken rock material called regolith builds the C 
                horizon. The depth of this horizon depends on the type and intensity of weathering which in turn 
                is determined by prevailing climatic conditions and rock type. 
                2. Eluviation (Lessivage and leaching): It is the process that gives rise to the A horizon i.e. it is 
                the downward washing of soil particles in suspension. The washing out of material gives the 
                upper layer its distinctive characteristics. 
                3. Illuviation: It is the basic process that builds the B horizon and it involves the accumulation of 
                eluviated and leached materials in the lower layers of the same soil. The accumulation of these 
                soil materials usually occurs below the upper layer and above the the recently weathered material 
                to build a middle layer or B horizon. The characteristics of this horizon largely depends on the 
                nature of materials redeposited or precipitated. 
                4. Organic sorting: It is responsible for the development of the organic layer on the surface 
                comprising the fermentation and humus layers. Decomposition involves mineralization (i.e. the 
                biochemical breakdown of organic matter to form simple structure soluble substances of purely 
                mineral compounds such as nitrates and metal cation and gases (e.g. CO2) and humification (i.e. 
                the process that leads to the formation of humus from the breakdown of dead matter wherein 
                some of the acids immediately recombine or polymerise to give an insoluble precipitate called 
                humus). Humification involves polymerization (i.e. the grouping of molecules into long chains) 
                20 
                and polysaccharides (i.e. organic gums that have been formed as a direct product of bacteria 
                digestion. These gums are vital in maintaining soil structure). 
                5. Capillary action: It is the upward movement of soluble soil material from the lower layer or 
                bedrock below to the upper layers of the soil. This might produce fertile soils especially if it 
                involves upward movement of calcium as in semi-arid areas called calcification. This produces 
                soils such as chernozems. 
                6. Translocation: It is a process which reorganizes the different soil materials to produce 
                different layers or horizons. This involves eluviation and illuviation.  
                Lesson 11: Classes of soil 
                A. Basis of Classification 
                1. The taxonomic or empirical approach: It is based on soil property such as texture and 
                colour. This is the oldest system of classification. 
                2. The morphologic approach: This approach is based on profile characteristics as observed in 
                the field. Using this approach, world soils are classified according to the nature of leaching and 
                the materials found in the B horizon.  With this approach, two main categories of soils are 
                identified i.e. pedalfers (being highly leached soils rich in aluminum and iron) and pedocals (less 
                leached and rich in calcium). 
                3. The genetic classification: This is the most widely used classification introduced by the 
                Russians in the later part of the ninetieth century. It is based on the environmental factors that 
                contribute to soil formation and it classifies soils into three main groups i.e. zonal, intrazonal 
                and azonal. 
                B. Zonal Soils 
                a. Meaning 
                Zonal soils are soils whose characteristics are determined by climate thus these soils are mature 
                with well developed profiles whose characteristics and distribution correspond broadly to 
                climatic and vegetational zones of the world. 
                21 
                b. Characteristics of Zonal soils 
                 They occur over wide, well drained undulating areas that correspond to broad climatic and 
                vegetation conditions. 
                 Climate exerts a dominant influence on its formation i.e. on water supply, weathering, palnt 
                and animal life and on the environment of material within soil (translocation), all of which 
                are important pedogenic agents. 
                 They have horizons though not in all cases clearly defined and hence fully developed soil 
                profiles. 
                 They have been in existence for a long time and are therefore mature soils. 
                 They do not change greatly over time though minor changes take place and to this effect, 
                they are in a state of dynamic equilibrium. 
                 They belong to two broad categories i.e. pedalfers and pedocals. 
                C. Intrazonal soils 
                a. Meaning 
                These are soils whose formation and characteristics are influenced by some local conditions such 
                as poor drainage, geology and salinity and not by climate. Thus they occur in pockets/patches 
                within the zonal soils but with different characteristics in response to these local conditions. 
                b. Characteristics of Intrazonal soils 
                 They occur in small areas as isolated soils within zonal soils. 
                 Local conditions exert great influence than climate e.g. calcareous parent rock, poor 
                drainage, etc. 
                 They have horizons which are not in agreement with those of zonal soils of the area. 
                Types of Intrazonal soils 
                1. Calcimorphic soils: They develop on and reflect excessive calcareous parent material such as 
                limestone and chalk e.g. Rendzina and terra rosa. 
                2. Halomorphic soils: They result from excessive salt concentration e.g. Solonchaks, Solonetz 
                and Soloth 
                3. Hydromorphic soils:  They form from poorly drained areas such as peat, bog and gley. 
                D. Azonal Soils 
                a. Meaning  
                These are young soils which do not have well developed profiles. That is, they are too young or 
                immature and without sufficient time to develop characteristics that would relate them to climate. 
                22 
                
                
                23 
                
                Thus their characteristics are essentially those that have been inherited from the parent material 
                from which they are formed. Examples include volcanic and alluvial soils. 
                b. Characteristics of Azonal soils 
                 They do not have distinctive profiles 
                 They have been in existence for a short time and hence, climate and organisms have not 
                fully expressed their influence. 
                 They are essentially made up of recent deposits laid down by agents of erosion or ejected 
                volcanic ash. 
                 Their characteristics are largely those inherited from the parent material from which they 
                are formed. 
                 They may be changed over time into mature or zonal soils as they grow older.

                Lesson 12: Meaning of Natural Vegetation 
                A. Definition  
                It is the vegetation which would be found growing if man had not destroyed it or modify by 
                physical conditions in which it grows. In other words, it is a plant community which develops 
                with little or no interference from man and whose form and composition vary in a systematic 
                manner with the elements of the physical environment especially climate, soil and relief. 
                Plants growing in a particular area are known as plant community and a plant community that is 
                dominated by only one specie is called a consociation (e.g. coniferous forest) while that with 
                numerous species is called association (e.g. tropical rain forest). The most abundant specie in 
                any plant community and which exercises greater influence on the habitat is referred to as the 
                dominant. 
                B. Plant groupings and classification  
                There are two main approaches that are used to classify vegetation. They include: 
                 The floristic approach: It is based on species composition.  Using this approach, we simply 
                produce a list of plant species found in an area and designate the vegetation types 
                accordingly. Such a list is usually arranged in families and genera together with a key to aid 
                identification. The disadvantage of this approach is that it does not bring to light the relative 
                abundance of species, their characteristic arrangements as landscape elements. 
                 The structural approach: It is based on the way in which the living parts of the plants are 
                shaped and distributed in space. This is based on the life form (e.g. nature of the plants like 
                trees, shrub, herbs, etc.), size and stratification, leave size and shape, leave texture, etc. This 
                approach is more important and widely used. 
                On the basis of the structural approach, the vegetation of the world has been classified into four 
                broad divisions called biochores which are further subdivided into sub groups called formation 
                classes. They include: 
                1. Forest Vegetation or Biochore: This is vegetation in which the dominant species are trees, 
                although there may be a small proportion of woodish shrubs and herbaceous plants. Trees require 
                sufficient moisture for their growth thus forest grow in areas with enough rainfall year round or 
                sufficient soil moisture. The major formation classes under the forest biochore are; tropical rain 
                forest, monsoon forest or tropical deciduous forest, temperate deciduous forest and coniferous 
                taiga) forest.  
                2. Savannah biochore or woodland: This is a combination of trees and grasses in various 
                proportions. The trees are less tall and may be even or unevenly scattered and interspersed with 
                surfaces covered by grasses or by other life-forms such as shrubs. It develops in areas with 
                limited total annual rainfall with uneven distribution throughout the year. The formation classes 
                under this category include: Guinea savannah, Sudan savannah and Sahel savannah. 
                3. Grassland Biochore: This is a type of plant community composed mainly of herbaceous 
                species especially members of the grass family. Trees may appear only in moister habitats such 
                as river valleys. Grassland is found where total annual rainfall is low or precipitation every year 
                may be high but excess soil moisture loss via evaporation. The formation classes here are; 
                Prairie and steppe grasslands. 
                4. Deset Biochore or vegetation:  This is vegetation with thinly disperse plants usually scattered 
                herbs and shrubs and a high percentage of bare ground. It is associated with climate of extreme 
                aridity and develops in areas where precipitation is very low, low soil moisture due to excess 
                24 
                evaporation or frozen water in cold deserts. The formation classes are; hot desert vegetation and 
                cold desert or Tundra vegetation. 
                C. Importance of Vegetation 
                 It enriches the soils with litter, humus and nutrients 
                 It also protects the soils against erosion i.e. the canopy reduces raindrop intensity and the 
                roots of plants tend to bind soil together. 
                 Vegetation helps to regulate climate. i.e. it absorbs CO2 during photosynthesis, which is a 
                greenhouse gas this helps to lower temperatures. Vegetation also supplies the atmosphere 
                with moisture through evapotranspiration thereby increasing atmospheric humidity and 
                precipitation formation. 
                 Vegetation provides habitat for a variety of fauna 
                 Most importantly, green plants are the only earthly objects that are capable of converting 
                solar energy into chemical or food energy needed by the biological components of 
                ecosystems. 
                 Ecologically, vegetation affects soils, climate and animal life. 
                 Socio-economically, vegetation is a source of fuel, income, construction material and of 
                medicinal value to man. 
                Lesson 13: Evolution of Vegetation over Time 
                A. Notion of Plant or Ecological Succession 
                It takes hundreds and thousands of years for the vegetation of an area to develop fully. This 
                occurs through a process known as plant or ecological succession. 
                Plant or ecological succession is a sequence of vegetation development wherein one plant 
                community is progressively replaced by another with a different composition and structure in a 
                given area, due to changes in its habitat caused by the plants themselves (autogenic) or external 
                factors (allogenic). 
                B. Types of Succession  
                Two main types of plant succession can be distinguished i.e. primary and secondary successions. 
                1. Primary Succession: It is also known as prisere and it is that which takes place on a 
                completely new surface that has never been inhabited by vegetation. The occurrence of this type 
                is rare but where circumstances warrants it, it is likely to occur on; newly emerged coast land or 
                lake bed, newly formed sand dune or new emitted lava layers. 
                25 
                2. Secondary Succession: Also referred to as subsere, it is a succession which develops on a site 
                that was formerly inhabited by vegetation but the original vegetation might have been destroyed 
                either by a natural catastrophy or by human interference. 
                C. Site of Prisere 
                a. Lithosere: This is that which is likely to develop on bare rock surfaces like lava from volcanic 
                eruption, areas of retreating glacier or newly emerged islands in the sea. The plants that grow 
                26 
                here are those with a low nutrient requirement thus, they extracts nutrients directly from the bare 
                rocks and rain water. Examples of such plants are; blue-green algae, lichens and mosses. 
                b. Psammosere: It develops on sand dunes especially along coastal areas. Examples of pioneer 
                community here are marram grass, sea couch and lime grass. They have folded eaves, long 
                roots, fast growing, shining leaves to reflect sunlight, etc. The oak trees are the climax 
                vegetation. 
                c. Halosere: They develop on river estuaries as a result of the deposition at the mouth. This 
                pioneer vegetation has the ability to tolerate submergence by tides and the plants also trap mud to 
                accumulate on the surface with deeper sediments. Halophytes invade the area with long roots to 
                trap more mud. On mud, sea water trapped in hollows may be evaporated leaving behind salt 
                pans with high level of salinity. Inland, non-halophytic plants are found and followed by small 
                trees before large ones marking climax. 
                d. Hydrosere: This develops on ponds, marshes and lakes that are rich in sediments. The area is 
                usually colonized by algae and mosses whose seeds are brought in by wind and running water. 
                They grow and provide a habitat for primary succession and bacteria that help to decompose the 
                plants when they die. As soil conditions improve, other water loving plants like lilies and 
                pondweed invade the area. Marsh plants like sedges and reeds eventually encroach into the lake. 
                e. Xerosere: This is a plant community common in semi-arid and arid areas. The type of soil 
                here is the sandy desert soil which is dry and loose. Plants that grow here are called xerophytes 
                which are adapted for life with limited supply of water. This is the opposite of hydrophytes and 
                mesophytes that grow in areas with much water. 
                D. The Process of Plant colonization  
                A succession usually starts with a pioneer community and progressively evolves to a climax 
                community over time. This change is caused by either changes in environmental conditions like 
                climate, soil and drainage or are caused by the plants themselves. The process of colonisation or 
                succession involves distinct stages as follow: 
                1. Stage of colonization: This is the first stage of plant succession. This occurs when seeds are 
                brought into a virgin or abandoned surface via dispersal effected by wind, water or migrating 
                animals and insects. These germinates to form the first plant community called pioneer 
                community. This is made up of plants with low nutrient requirements e.g. lichens, mosses and 
                sedges. These plants are able to extract nutrients directly from the bare rocks and from rain 
                27 
                water. They common characteristics are that: they are low life forms, fewer species are involved, 
                low density and coverage, simple structure and low productivity. 
                2. Stage of invasion: This is the second stage and involves the coming into place of new seeds 
                brought by dispersal agents. As environmental conditions becomes more favourable, higher life 
                forms are progressively established such as herbs, then shrubs and woodland. More insects and 
                animals equally invade the area. After a while, these too will die, adding yet more humus and 
                nutrients to the soil, and increase its fertility. 
                3. Stage of competition and elimination: This stage comes after the area has been invaded by 
                many plants. This sets the stage for competition among the various plant species accompanied by 
                elimination and replacement. This solely involves the struggle for space, water, light, and 
                nutrients. The taller forms shade out the lower plants that cannot withstand the increased shade 
                or micro climate created. Thus, in this struggle for space and nutrients, the weaker species gives 
                way for the stronger ones, leading to the elimination of the weaker ones. 
                4. Stage of dominance and consolidation: This is the final phase or position of the dominant 
                plant community which remains as the climax vegetation. This involves adaptation to the 
                existing environmental conditions by developing suitable roots, stems and leaves which enable 
                them to survive indefinitely in the existing conditions of the area. No further replacement occurs 
                other than the death of old plants and their replacement by the next generation of that same 
                species. This is called the climax community. 
                E. Arresting Factors  
                These are those factor which prevents the evolution/succession of a pioneer community to attain 
                climax stage. That is, they prevent a succession from running its full course. These factors are 
                grouped into physical and human as follows; 
                a. Physical factors 
                1. Volcanic eruptions: One of the check to plant succession may be volcanic eruption which 
                destroys or displaces existing vegetation. For example, the vegetation on the slopes of Mount 
                Cameroon has been affected by volcanic eruptions. Also the climax plant community on 
                Krakatoa in Indonesia was wiped out in 1883 due to a volcanic eruption. 
                2. Earthquakes: An earthquake may also disturb plant succession by destroying or displacing 
                existing vegetation. 
                3. Floods: This may also suddenly displace a climax plant community by killing the existing 
                species or washing them away, leaving little or no evidence of the vegetation cover. 
                28 
                4. Changes in climate: Long term changes may arise from changes in climate. This is evident 
                from studies of the Pleistocene period in Western Europe when there were extensive 
                modifications and adjustments in the climax plant community. Also, the climate may become 
                drier or colder. 
                b. Human factors  
                1. The use of fire to clear forest and other areas of vegetation as a preliminary to farming. 
                2. The introduction of grazing animals which has resulted in the destruction of grass species, 
                undergrowth and animals such as cattle, sheep and goats in the savanna region. 
                3. The use of unsuitable farming methods such as shifting cultivation and over cultivation 
                4. The extraction of mineral wealth from under the ground to the detriment of plant communities 
                on the surface e.g. extraction of manganese in the Amazon valley. 
                5. Environmental pollution by the use of chemicals in the soil and atmospheric pollutants. 
                6. Alterations to drainage patterns by building of dams and reclaiming marsh lands. 
                Lesson 14: Concept of Climax Vegetation 
                A. Meaning of climax vegetation 
                A climax vegetation is the final plant community of a long term succession that is in dynamic 
                equilibrium with the environmental conditions. In other words, a climax vegetation is one which 
                is on equilibrium with the prevailing climatic condition, relief and soils. It is usually the 
                optimum vegetation of a particular long term plant succession left undisturbed which have been 
                established in relation to the physical environmental conditions of climate, relief and soil. 
                NB: The concept of climax is highly hypothetical and currently controversial due to two basic 
                reasons such as: 
                 The time required for a succession to run its course is always long for the real final 
                community to be observed. Thus, what may be regarded as ‘final climax communities’ may 
                still be changing hence, it is probably more accurate to say that the rate of succession is so 
                slow in a climax community that, from the perspective of a single human life time, it appears 
                to be stable. 
                 Secondly, the succession is often disturbed by natural or human factors. Some landscapes 
                never reach a stable climax in the traditional sense because they are characterized by and 
                29 
                adapted to, periodic disruptions. Thus, there is little or no vegetation that exists in its natural 
                state. 
                B. The Mono and Polyclimax views 
                The concept of climax was first was first introduced in 1916 by F. E Clement who suggested a 
                monoclimax theory. According to him, each climatic zone can only have one type of climax 
                vegetation. That is, the idea is that the plant community is in equilibrium with climatic 
                conditions. Thus, he gave it the name climatic climax community. 
                In 1935, Tansely questioned the overriding significance of climate and brought in other physical 
                factors that could equally affect the development of climax such as soil, relief, drainage and 
                microclimate. He immediately suggested a polyclimax theory as against the monoclimax theory 
                of Clement. Within the same region, there exists edaphic differences and such a region is likely 
                to have several climaxes. Hence, there will exist a climatic climax which is in equilibrium with 
                the general climate and edaphic climaxes which are modified by local conditions of the sub 
                strate. 
                C. Types of Climaxes  
                1. Climatic climax: This is when the development of climax community is controlled by the 
                climate of the region. For instance, development of Maple-beech climax community over moist 
                soil. Climatic climax is theoretical and develops where physical conditions are not so extreme as 
                to modify the effects of the prevailing regional climate. 
                2. Edaphic climax: When there are more than one climax community in the region, modified by 
                local conditions of the soil moisture, soil nutrients, topography, slope exposure, fire and animal 
                activity. Succession ends in an edaphic climax where topography, soil, water or other 
                disturbances are such that a climatic climax cannot develop. 
                3. Catastrophic climax: Climax vegetation vulnerable to a catastrophic even such as a wildfire. 
                The wildfire removes the mature vegetation and decomposers. A rapid development of 
                herbaceous vegetation follows until the shrub dominance is re-established. This is known as 
                catastrophic climax. For example, the shrubs in the Bankigili lava track shows a catastrophic 
                climax. 
                4. Disclimax: When a stable community which is neither the climatic nor edaphic climax for the 
                site, is maintained by man or his domestic animals (disturbance climax) or anthropogenic sub 
                climax (man-generated). For example, overgrazing by stock may produce a desert community of 
                bushes where the local climate actually would allow grassland to maintain itself. 
                30 
                5. Sub climax: This is the prolonged stage in succession just preceding the climatic climax. 
                6. Pre-climax: This develops in areas where the community has life forms lower than those in 
                the expected climatic climax. This types develops mostly in less moist and hotter areas. 
                7. Post-climax: This is a type which has life forms higher than those in the expected climatic 
                climax. It usually develops in more moist and cooler areas than that of surrounding climate. 
                D. Debate on the climax status of the grasslands in the world 
                Case 1: Tropical Grassland 
                The debate pertaining to the status of the tropical grassland has persisted for long as there are 
                those who argue that it is the climax of the area in which it grows while others are of the opinion 
                that it is a plagioclimax or disclimax. The tropical grassland vegetation is found between the 
                tropical rainforest and the hot desert. It lies between latitudes 50 and 150 north and south of the 
                equator. It occurs in areas such as the interior of west, central and east Africa, northern Australia, 
                and the Illanos of the Orinocco basin in Venezuela and the Campos of the Brasilian highlandsin 
                South America. This vegetation has a tropical continental climate with two distinct seasons (wet 
                season of about 9months near the rainforest and 3 months near the deserts) and dry season. 
                Rainfall here is moderate to low hardly exceeding 1500mm per anum and decreases as we move 
                closer to the deserts. Temperatures are generally high (about 250C) with an annual range of about 
                110C. The soils here ferruginous soils in the wetter parts and the tropical black earth in the drier 
                parts of savanna region. 
                a. Why the Savannah vegetation is considered as a climax plant community 
                A vegetation would be considered as climax if is adapted to the prevailing physical 
                environmental conditions. The Savanna vegetation can be considered a climax vegetation due to 
                the following reasons 
                 The changes in the nature and character of the vegetation desertwards which is a reflection of 
                the decrease in the amount and duration of rainfall. This means that the original limits of the 
                variety of savanna are dictated principally by climate. On this basis, three types of savanna 
                can be identified i.e. Guinea (woodland), Sudan (Parkland) and Sahel savannas.  
                 Most of the trees are deciduous in nature i.e. in the dry season, they lose or shed down their 
                leaves to avoid transpirational loss of water. 
                31 
                 Some grass avoid drought conditions by remaining inert or dormant durin the dry season. 
                The leaves of grasses turn yellowish-brown and die down leaving the roots and seeds 
                dormant on the surface until the onset of the wet season. With the first rain in the wet season, 
                the seed germinates and new leaves grow. 
                 Some are evergreen i.e. certain species of eucalyptus tree have a twisting leaf stem, turning 
                their leaves edge on to sunlight and reducing transpiration. 
                 Some trees such as the baobab (upside-down tree) and bottle trees have swollen trunks in 
                which they store water. Thus, they are able to survive loin dry season. 
                 Most of the plants such as acacias have long and deep roots to search for ground water in the 
                moist rock layer below the surface in the dry season. 
                 Most of the trees are umbrella-shaped or have flat tops like acacia to shield their roots from 
                the scorching heat and to expose only a narrow edge to the strong trade winds. 
                 Other plants such as Gum Arabica produce gum on their trunks and leaves that seal the pores 
                to keep transpiration to a minimum. 
                b. Why the Savanna is not considered a climax plant community 
                 It is argued that there is no such thing as a savanna climate to cause the development of a 
                savanna vegetation. This is because the amount of rainfall and its seasonal distribution are 
                not similar throughout the savanna region. 
                 Soil types are wide ranging and the same soils can have a vegetation cover of trees in one 
                place and grass in another in the same region. 
                 The present boundary of savanna has shifted into wetter regions which would have supported 
                forest under natural conditions. This is called derived savanna and are found mainly in man
                made clearings 
                 Most of the trees and grasses are fire-resistant (pyrophytic). This is an indication of persistent 
                fire events. 
                 Extensive grazing may have killed trees with edible foliage leaving only the thorny bushes 
                and trees such as acacias that have natural protection against grazing herbivores. 
                 Experiments have shown that in areas protected from fire and grazing animals, woody plants 
                increase in number quickly. This suggests that natural vegetation would be forest or more 
                woodland than what exist today. 
                32 
                NB: On this basis, it is argued that if the arresting factors of fire and grazing are removed, a 
                renewed succession will occur and the savanna grassland may evolve to a parkland vegetation as 
                the climax vegetation. 
                To conclude, the concept that savanna vegetation is a climatic climax is not strongly supported. 
                Climatic changes over time has made it more difficult to arrive at a definitive conclusion about 
                this problem. Instead there is considerable evidence of man’s intervention. Thus the savanna has 
                been subjected to various activities of man such as overgrazing, shifting cultivation, etc. it can 
                therefore be argued that the savanna in its present site is a plagioclimax vegetation. 
                Case 2: Temperate Grassland 
                The temperate grassland occurs between latitudes 300 and 400 north and south of the equator and 
                mainly in the interior of continents in the Northern hemisphere (Prairies of North America) and 
                also in the Eastern Coast of certain areas in the Southern hemisphere such as South America 
                (Pampas of Argentina), South Africa (Veld of South Africa), Australia (Downs of the Murray
                Darling plains) and New Zealand (Canterbury grasslands), Eurasia (Steppes), China 
                (Manchuria). These areas experience the warm temperate continental climate characterized by 
                warm wet summers and cold dry winters. Mean annual temperatures is about 160C with monthly 
                mean higher in summer than in winter. Temperature range is about 300C and mean annual 
                precipitation is low ranging from 250mm near desert margin to about 750mm near the temperate 
                forest. Evaporation is higher in summer than in winter. The zonal soil here is the chernozem, 
                which is rich in plant nutrients especially calcium. 
                a. Reasons why temperate grassland is considered as climax plant community 
                The temperate grassland is essentially composed of grasses without trees. This is in contrast with 
                the tropical grassland which exhibits a scattering of trees and shrubs. The absence of trees in the 
                temperate grassland is attributed to the scanty rainfall, long dry period, lowe soil moisture and 
                severe winter. The main grasses here are; Blue stem, Buffalo grass, Black-eyed Susan. 
                 The vegetation changes in form with variations in rainfall. The boundaries of vegetation 
                are therefore closely related to climate. 
                 The grasses usually lie dormant during the prolonged drought. They sprout and come to 
                life again as soon as temperatures rise above 60C, warm enough for plant growth. 
                 Due to frequent droughts, the vegetation has developed protective mechanisms such as 
                leaves which curl up to prevent evaporation loss, and well developed root fibres which 
                can obtain moisture deep down soil. 
                33 
                 The vegetation also has a rapid growth cycle. 
                b. Reasons against the temperate climax view 
                 The boundary of grassland in some areas has shifted into wetter regions that would have 
                normally supported but forest vegetation. This relates to human activity. For example, in 
                New Zealand, intense grazing on the hills where rainfall is up to 2000mm per annum now 
                has grasslands increasing down hill. 
                 Protected areas of the North American prairies have regenerated to forest. This suggests 
                that the original climax vegetation might have been forest not grassland. 
                 Wind breaks are planted in the South American Pampas which have grown to tall trees 
                revealing that trees might have been the original vegetation but Ameri-Indians might 
                have frequently used fire on that vegetation and consequently degenerating it to grasses. 
                 Grazing has been going on for a long time in the region. The biome constitutes not only 
                the granaries of the cereals but also the ranch-lands of the world which are associated 
                with extensive ranching. 
                 Mechanized cereal farming has persisted in the region for a long time. Frequent burning 
                and cultivation suggests that natural grasses have been replaced with cultured grasses of 
                wheat and maize. This results in the introduction of a cultured or created environment. 
                To conclude, temperate grasslands are in anthropogenic or plagioclimax or even polyclimax in 
                the present site with the physical environment especially climate being only a permissive factor. 
                Lesson 15: Examples of Plant Succession  
                A. Primary Succession 
                A lithosere has been defined as a type of primary succession which occurs on a bare rock 
                surface. It can develop on bare rock exposed by a retreating glacier such as that left by the retreat 
                of ice from the uplands of Scotland following the last glacial phase. It can also develop on ash or 
                lava following a volcanic eruption on land or forming a new island or land emerging from sea as 
                a result of isostatic uplift. 
                The island of Krakatoa in Indonesia presents a good example of a primary succession on a bare 
                rock surface of ash and lava following a volcanic eruption. Krakatoa is an island in the Sunda 
                straits, mid-way between Java and Sumatra. In August 1883, a series of eruptions reduced the 
                island of Krakatoa to one-third of its previous size and left a layer of ash over 50m deep. No 
                vegetation or animal life was left on the island or in the surrounding sea. Before the eruption, 
                34 
                1883, the uninhabited land was covered by rainforest near the base and montane forest in the 
                higher parts. After the eruption, a completely new surface was formed so that a subsequent 
                vegetation development is seen as a primary rather than secondary succession. The new surface 
                of lava and ash formed had never been colonized by plants. 
                The first colonisers arrived in three ways i.e. most were seeds blown from surrounding islands by 
                wind, while others drifted from the sea or were carried by birds. A few months after eruption, 
                blue-green bacteria was the pioneer community living on the inorganic surface. They are able to 
                extract nutrients from the unweathered rocks. This pioneer community contributed to the 
                breakdown of the volcanic rocks into elementary soil, providing a substrate on which other 
                plants can root. Later on, the second seral community was established consisting of ferns, shrubs, 
                dense, grass, some macanrandra and figs.  
                With improvement in the environmental conditions, as soils deepened and become enriched with 
                litter and humus, shrubs and trees increased in number and species such that by 1918, the number 
                of species has risen to 132. There was an increasing number of macarandra, Neonauclea trees 
                and figs, woodland later invaded the area with neonuaclea trees taking over from macarandra and 
                figs such that the rainforest was ultimately re-established as a climax vegetation. 
                NB: It should be noted here that the whole process of the prisere was relatively fast because the 
                material (volcanic ash) on which development took place was very previous, easily penetrable 
                and very rich in plant nutrients. Thus this does not illustrate a number of features which are 
                typical of all or most successions. 
                B. Secondary Succession 
                In October 1981, a mudflow occurred in Rosa, Arran covering all the existing vegetation. 
                Twelve months later, it was estimated that 20 per cent of the flow had been recolonized, a figure 
                that had grown to 40 per cent in 1984 and 70 per cent in 1988. But had this been a primary 
                succession, lichens and mosses would have formed the pioneer community and they would 
                probably have covered only a small area. The pioneer plants would probably also have been 
                randomly distributed and even after seven years, the species would have been few in number and 
                small in height.  
                Instead, by 1988, much of the flow had already been recolonised. It could be seen that most of 
                the plants were found near the edges of the flow and were not randomly distributed, and there 
                were already several species including grasses, heather, bog myrtle and mosses, some of which 
                exceeded 50cm in height. These observations suggest a secondary succession with plants from 
                35 
                the surrounding climax community having invaded the flow, mainly due to the dispersal of their 
                seeds by wind. 
                Lesson 16: Spatial Distribution of Vegetation 
                A. Horizontal distribution  
                World major vegetation reflects the influence of climate. These vegetation regions are similar to 
                climatic regions of the world. The following regions can be identified corresponding to the 
                various latitudinal extent.

                Kalahari and Namib deserts in South 
                Africa, Thar and Gobi deserts in the 
                Middle East, Mohave desert in USA and 
                West Australian desert. 
                650 and 800 mainly in the 
                Northern hemisphere 
                Alaska, Canada, Russia and all of 
                Greenland 
                The pattern of vertical changes in vegetation is similar to the latitudinal distribution from the 
                equator to the poles. The vertical changes are in terms of the type of vegetation and a general 
                decrease in the number of species, intensity and density of vegetation cover from the foot to the 
                top of high mountains.  
                High mountains within the tropical region such as Mount Cameroon, Mount Kenya and the 
                Kilimanjaro generally portray the following vertical changes: a dense forest at the lower slopes 
                followed by a mix of forest-savanna then grasslands; conifers and sometimes scrub-like 
                37 
                vegetation to sometimes snow covered tops. The vertical changes on the slopes of the Ethiopian 
                highland is as follows: at the base is the tropical rainforest, followed by wooded savannah, 
                deciduous forest, coniferous forest, tundra vegetation to the end with snow and icescaps at the 
                top. On mount Cameroon at 4100m, plant life begins with swamp forest through cleared forest 
                for plantations, forest, and grass to scrub vegetation. 
                A number of factors account for such vertical variations in vegetation. These relate to differences 
                in height, gradient and aspect, which in turn cause variation in: 
                 Soil organic matter and depth upslope 
                 Soil moisture upslope 
                 Climatic conditions with increase in height 
                C. Factors of vegetation distribution 
                a. Climatic factors: They include the following 
                1. Light: Light is needed for photosynthesis and varies according to latitudes (phototropism). 
                This is common in sun loving plants which are called heliophytes. Those that like shades or 
                darkness are called sciophytes. Thus, the density of vegetation depends on its need for light and 
                the availability of the light. 
                2. Temperatures:  It determines germination and growth rate of plants greatly. Low temperature 
                lead to freezing which limits the growing period. High temperatures on the other hand leads to 
                high rates of evapotranspiration and this reduces soil moisture needed by plants to grow. 
                Moderate temperatures are good for plant growth. 
                3. Precipitation: It determines the rate of water supply to plants as soil moisture through which 
                nutrients are absorbed and circulated through plants (moderate rainfall). Low rainfall reduces soil 
                moisture and dissolution of plant nutrients is retarded. This leads to droughts or desert conditions 
                which are not good for plant growth. High rainfall on the other hand leads to erosion and 
                leaching which degrades soil nutrients and fertility. As a result, plant growth rate is negatively 
                affected. 
                b. Relief (geomorphic) factor: This is limited to the modification of climatic conditions due to 
                altitude, slope angle, form and aspects that influence the growth of vegetation. Generally, 
                lowlands are characterized by deposition of alluvial materials that make the soils more fertile. 
                38 
                Also, lowlands are warm and can support greater vegetation. On the other hand, highland areas 
                experience greater soil erosion leading to poor soils and low rates of plant growth. Also, 
                highlands are cold and experience freezing (coniferous forest). Thus such areas do not favour 
                plant growth.  Sun facing slopes will have greater warmth which in turn favours the density of 
                vegetation. The reverse is true for slopes which do not face the sun especially those in the 
                northern and southern poles which are very cool and characterized by low temperatures and 
                freezing. This retard plant growth. 
                c. Soil (edaphic) factors: Plants need deep stable and fertile soils with good drainage for plant 
                uptake. Such soils support greater vegetation growth. On the other hand, poor soils like desert, 
                ferruginous soils generally do not support greater plant growth. 
                d. Biotic factors: The influence of parasite, pests, insects, diseases and other animals and 
                competition for plant food in the soil can eliminate some plant species and only the stronger 
                species survives. 
                e. Human factors: This refers to the effects of man and his activites on plant life and 
                distribution. Much of the natural vegetation of the earth’s surface has been destroyed and 
                transformed into secondary vegetation. The activities of man that greatly modify natural 
                vegetation include; farming, grazing, lumbering and urbanization. For may be degraded to 
                savanna. Humans also introduces certain species at the expense of others. For example, the 
                introduction of eucalyptus trees in most parts of the Africa and Australia. 
                Lesson 17: Meaning of Natural Vegetation 
                A. Definition of ecology and ecosystem 
                Ecology is the study of the interrelationship between living organisms and the environment in 
                which they live. The environment here refers to all conditions in which an organism lives. It is 
                subdivided into physical (temperature, water, gases, pH value, rocks and nutrients in the soil) and 
                the human, living or biotic environment (animals, humans, bacteria and fungi). 
                Ecosystem on the other hand is a self-sustaining unit, small or large of the earth’s surface that 
                consist of all the organisms (plants and animals) and physical features existing and interacting 
                together in a particular area. 
                B. Components of ecosystems  
                These are the substances or conditions which make up ecosystems. Irrespective of the size or 
                type, all ecosystems are made up of two main components i.e. the biotic and abiotic components.

                1. Biotic Components 
                This refers to all the living things in an ecosystem and include; plants, animals and micro
                organisms found in an area. All living things fall into two groups i.e. producers and consumers or 
                heterotrophs 
                a. Producers: These are all the organisms that can make their own food using inorganic 
                substances. These are mainly green plants, certain bacteria and algae. They manufacture their 
                food through a process called photosynthesis whereby they absorb water from the soil and 
                combine with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the presence of sunlight to produce 
                carbohydrate. During this process, oxygen is given off as by-product. Since they manufacture 
                their own food, the producers are also called autotrophs meaning self-feeders. 
                b. Consumers or Heterotrophs: These are all the organisms or living things in an ecosystem 
                that cannot manufacture their own food but depend on other organisms for their food and energy. 
                Depending on what they eat as food, consumers have been classified into: herbivores, carnivores, 
                omnivores and decomposers or detritivores. 
                 Herbivores: These are organisms that eat herbs or plants for their food energy. Examples are 
                cartepillars, grasshoppers, rabbits, goats, sheeps and cows. 
                40 
                 Carnivores: They are organisms that consume the flesh or meat of the herbivores to get food 
                energy. There are small and large carnivores. Examples of carnivores are cats, lions, dogs, 
                etc. 
                 Omnivores: They are organisms which feed on both herbs and flesh. Man and fox are 
                examples. 
                 Decomposers or detritivores: These are organisms that consume waste or dead matter to 
                gain food energy. These include micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi and macro 
                organisms such as earthworms and termites. Decomposers help to breakdown waste matter 
                into simpler substances and helps to convert some of the organic matter into minerals which 
                can be used again by the living plants. 
                2. Abiotic components 
                These are the non-living things or conditions in an area. This embodies soil, climate (sunlight 
                and precipitation), minerals from weathered rocks, water and solar energy. It should be noted 
                here that these abiotic components provide living space and other resources needed by the living 
                things including man. 
                C. Characteristics of Ecosystems 
                 They are well structured i.e. all ecosystems are made up of two main parts namely the 
                physical or abiotic environment which provides energy, raw materials and living space; and 
                the biotic components which consist of all the living things such as producers, herbivores, 
                carnivores, omnivores and decomposers living in the area. 
                 They are sustained by various forms of relationships and interactions. This in all cases 
                involves the flow of energy and the cycling of materials i.e. they depend on each other by the 
                exchanges that take place between the different components. 
                 They occupy different spaces which may be land (terrestrial ecosystems) or water (aquatic 
                ecosystems). 
                 They vary greatly in size and scale as some are small while others are large such as the rain 
                forests of the Congo basin. 
                 Ecosystems generally have arbitrary boundaries. For example, forest and grassland 
                ecosystems gradually merge. Thus, it is often more common to find a broad transitional zone 
                called ecotone rather than a sharp dividing line. 
                 All ecosystems are open systems, receiving and losing inputs and outputs of matter/energy 
                across their boundaries. 
                41 
                
                
                42 
                
                 Ecosystems are always in a state of dynamic equilibrium.  
                Lesson 18: Ecosystem as a system 
                All ecosystems are open systems comprising inputs, processes/stores and outputs. 
                A. The inputs, stores/processes and outputs 
                1. Inputs into Ecosystems  
                These are the substances and energy that get into ecosystems from surrounding areas. They 
                include; 
                a. Atmospheric inputs: This include; solar energy that comes in through direct sunshine or solar 
                radiation. This facilitates organic matter production through photosynthesis. Water brought in via 
                precipitation and gases from neighbouring atmosphere through atmospheric circulation. 
                b. Biological inputs: This includes animals from neighbouring areas that migrate into an 
                ecosystem. Seeds of plants from adjacent ecosystems brought through dispersal by wind, running 
                water, insects and migrating animals. 
                c. Geological inputs: This includes soil and mineral nutrients from the weathering of bedrock. 
                These can increase the fertility of the soil if more nutrients are not lost from the ecosystem. 
                There is also water from underground sources. 
                d. Artificial inputs: These are introduced into ecosystems by man and include; various 
                chemicals (such as fertilisers, pesticides, etc, introduced in the system for various purposes), 
                plants and animals brought from neighbouring areas, new technology introduced in an area, 
                artificial energy (HEP, petroleum, etc for powering machines and for lighting). 
                2. Stores and Processes in Ecosystem  
                a. The Stores: Some of the inputs that get into the system are kept in stores for sometime before 
                they are used and exchanged by the various components. The major stores here include; 
                 Soil i.e. where water and nutrients are stored for plant use 
                 Biomass i.e. which is the mass of organic matter in terms of weight (dry weight). This 
                embodies nutrients or materials stored in plant and animal tissues. 
                 Litter i.e. which refers to undecomposed plant and animal waste on the surface. The minerals 
                contain in plant tissues and leaves, animal carcasses are not immediately released into the 
                soil. Thus nutrients within these tissues are kept for sometime. 
                b. Processes: These are the actions which take place for ecosystems to function well. These 
                include the use and exchange of ener4gy and materials among the different components. The 
                major processes are: 
                 The flow of energy 
                 The cycling of materials. 
                All of these occur through the food chain or web. 
                3. The Outputs from Ecosystems 
                These are substances or products that leave the system or are taken away. These include animals 
                that migrate out or are hunted; seeds carried out by wind, running water or animals; heat given 
                off by the surface or by burning; plants harvested; water lost via run off or evapotranspiration 
                among others. It also embodies nutrients which are lost from the soil through leaching, erosion 
                and crop harvesting. 
                2) Aquatic (water) ecosystems 
                Lesson 19: Examples of Ecosystems  
                1) Terrestrial Ecosystems. 
                These are the largest ecosystems on the surface of the earth. They are called biomes. The 
                examples of these large terrestrial (land) ecosystems are; 
                a) The forest ecosystem: The main vegetation species are trees e.g tropical rainforest 
                ecosystem, tropical deciduous ecosystems, etc. 
                b) Grassland ecosystem: The main vegetation here is grass. Examples are tropical grassland, 
                temperate grassland ecosystems etc. 
                c) The desert ecosystem e.g tropical desert ecosystem, temperate desert ecosystem. 
                They develop in water and marshy areas. It examples include; 
                a) Freshwater ecosystem: They are found in streams, rivers, ponds and lakes. Examples of lake 
                ecosystems include Lake Barombi Mbo, Male and female manenguba lakes, etc. 
                b) Marine ecosystems: These are ecosystems that develop in salty water. They can be at the 
                bottom of the oceans or along the coast. Mangroves are examples of marine ecosystems 
                along the coast. 
                43 
                Lesson 20: Interactions within Ecosystems  
                A. The structure of ecosystems 
                Every ecosystem has a well defined structure. This usually comprises of the various 
                compartments (components) that makes up the system. There are usually four basic 
                compartments within this structure and for convenience sake, these compartments can be 
                grouped into two main groups such as biotic and abiotic compartments (components). This is as 
                seen below. 
                Ecosystem  
                Abiotic components  
                Climate   
                Soil  
                Energy, 
                water, 
                minerals  
                Relief  
                Biotic components  
                Producer   
                Herbivores  
                Carnivores   
                Consumers  
                Omnivores  
                Decomposers   
                These different compartments are interrelated through the exchanges that take place among 
                them. These interrelation is illustrated in the figure below: 
                44 
                B. Ecosystem Equilibrium  
                All ecosystems under natural conditions are in a state of balance (equilibrium). Ecosystem 
                equilibrium thus refers to a stable state in the ecosystem which exists when the natural 
                environment and the resources found there can adequately support all the biotic components 
                without negative consequences. This equilibrium occurs when the number of plants or producers 
                is enough to support the number of herbivores, who in turn are just enough to support the other 
                consumer organisms. This equilibrium is a dynamic one as changes do take place in the area. For 
                instance, young plants and animals grow to replace old ones. Soils and atmospheric conditions 
                also change slightly not to create imbalance. 
                This equilibrium is maintained in the following ways; 
                 The continuous flow of energy from the sun to the plants where it is converted into food 
                energy through photosynthesis. This is stored in plant tissues and later taken up by other 
                45 
                organisms (animals) that cannot photosynthesis or flesh of other animals that have previously 
                eaten the plants to get the energy. 
                 Some amount of energy (about 90%) is lost as it passes through the food chain. This imposes 
                a limit to the number of organisms to be supported at each stage. This helps to regulate the 
                population of organisms so that the carrying capacity of the land is not exceeded thus 
                maintaining the equilibrium. 
                 The cycling of materials which ensures that nutrients and water have been used are made 
                available again for reuse. For instance, the nutrients taken from the soil by plants are returned 
                to the soil for reuse when the plants die and their waste is decomposed by micro-organisms. 
                 The ability for plants and animals to adapt to physical environment ensures their continuous 
                survival. For example, some plants develop long roots to search for water deep below the 
                surface when places are dry. Some also shed their leaves to avoid water loss through 
                transpiration. 
                 The relationship between the various living things enables them to support each other for 
                their needs. This relationship could be - - - - 
                A symbiotic relationship i.e. a relationship in which both organisms benefit from each other. 
                Commensalism i.e. that in which both one organism benefits from another but does not harm 
                it. 
                Parasitic relationship i.e. that in which one organism benefits from another but harms the 
                host organism. 
                Cooperation relationship i.e. that in which the organisms live or move together for 
                protection. 
                C. Factors of Ecosystem Disequilibrium 
                a. Natural factors 
                Climatic and meteorological hazards - - 
                Short-term meteorological anomalies relate to the occurrence of drought. Drought refers to a 
                transitional period of dryness or serious water shortage in formerly wetter regions. This is 
                common in semi-arid areas such as the Sahel. When this happens, vegetation dies and this 
                seriously disrupts the initial cycling processes between vegetation, animal, and soil. 
                Desertification is another hazard which upsets the initial turn over system between soil, 
                biomass and litter that in part sustained the ecosystem. 
                46 
                - - - - 
                Exceptionally, strong violent winds such as tornadoes and hurricanes cause damages not only 
                to man and property but also to communities of plants and animals. 
                Long-term climatic changes relate to global warming. It would lead to greater input of water 
                in some regions and coastal ecosystems would be flooded. Other regions would experience 
                greater output of water to become deserts. This would affect not only the components but 
                also the processes that initially sustained the various ecosystems. 
                Geological hazards 
                Volcanic eruptions emit hot lava, pyroclastic materials and very hot gases which burn, 
                suffocate, bury and kill or destroy plants and animal communities. Mount Cameroon 
                ecosystem has been affected by this. 
                Earthquakes have also destroyed natural communities or ecosystems. These can cause the 
                collapse of structures, displacements of segments of the crust, generate fire and cause floods. 
                These bury, burn and damage existing natural communities.  
                b. Human factors 
                 Deforestation: The clearance of vegetation cover for fuel wood or to provide farmland, 
                construction material and settlement sites destabilizes ecosystems. The rain forest ecosystem 
                in the Amazon basin has been destabilized in this way. This activity has destroyed the habitat 
                of many species, exposed the soil o erosion, leaching and hence the net effect is greater on 
                animal and plant species. 
                 Over cultivation: The over cultivation of ecosystem soils to meet increasing food demands 
                has resulted in accelerated soil erosion. Bush burning for cultivation also destroys ecosystem 
                balance. 
                 Over grazing: This is detrimental to ecosystem especially in the savanna and had resulted in 
                the advancement of desert (desertification), a scenario typical with the Sahel zone. The 
                vegetation is destroyed and soil exposed thereby affecting soil quality by making it more 
                drier, loose and eroded. 
                 Exploitation of mineral: This is disastrous especially within ecosystems as it result to land, 
                water and/or air pollution. More substances (toxic) are introduced into the environment than 
                they are disposed off. The accumulation of such toxic materials has harmful effects on the 
                organisms. 
                 Poaching (hunting): In extreme cases, this practice has led to expiration (elimination) of 
                some animal species from ecosystems involved. 
                47 
                 Over fishing: This leads to the deprivation of aquatic ecosystems of some species. This 
                inevitably disrupts the link in food chain for effective cycling of materials and flow of energy 
                which initially sustain the ecosystem. 
                 Industrialisation: This has resulted in the production of more waste; gases, smog and 
                chemicals that disrupt environmental balance. These pollutants harm organisms and some 
                contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer (e.g. CFCs). 
                 Land reclamation: It results in the transformation of wet land ecosystems into dry land. 
                Aquatic species which cannot survive in such dry lands disappear. 
                 The creation of cities has caused the most dramatic change in environmental balance in the 
                ecosystem. It has led to the original ecosystem being replaced by a completely artificial 
                ecosystem i.e. the giant city ecosystem. 
                Lesson 21: Energy Flow 
                A. Sources of energy in the ecosystem 
                The sun is the main source of energy in ecosystems. Solar energy is converted by green plants 
                through photosynthesis into food or chemical energy. This is then passed to all the other 
                organisms in the form of food through the food chain or food we. Any ecosystem is sustained in 
                part by the flow of energy through it. Energy is needed by all the living things for growth, 
                reproduction, work and survival. 
                B. The Laws of Energy 
                1. The First Law of Energy: Energy Conservation and Transformation 
                The first law of thermodynamics or the conservation of energy formulated by Albert Einstein 
                states that “energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can be transformed from one form to 
                another”. This implies that the amount of energy that enters the system is equal to the amount 
                that eventually leaves it and none is created nor destroyed but simply altered into other forms of 
                energy as it moves through the food web. 
                The sun’s energy is transformed into other forms of energy and at the ecosystem level, high 
                quality energy enters in the form of light energy. This is then transformed into a useable form 
                (chemical energy) by producers (plants) through photosynthesis which in turn is stored in the 
                form of carbohydrate. Much of the energy moves in this form in the various trophic levels as one 
                type of organism consumes the previous one as food and is in turn eaten by another. At each 
                48 
                trophic level, some is converted into mechanical energy while some is used and lost to the 
                surrounding as low quality energy or heat. 
                This mechanical energy exists in two forms i.e. as potential energy which is that stored in the 
                organisms which is later converted into a second form called kinetic energy during movements. 
                The energy that is used in the various life processes of the organisms such as for growth and 
                reproduction is changed through respiration into heat energy which is of low value and cannot be 
                utilized again by producers. 
                The energy stored within organic matter that is not released during decomposition (as heat), may 
                be concentrated geologically for a long period and eventually converted into other forms called 
                fossil fuel such as coal, petroleum and natural gas and stored within rocks. This process of 
                conversion of organic waste into fossil fuel is known as carbonification.  
                In this light, if we were to list in one column all the energy inputs into the system including 
                energy withdrawn from storage and in another column all the energy output, including energy 
                going into storage, we would realize that both columns are equal. In this case, none has been 
                created nor destroyed but simply changed into other forms. 
                2. The Second Law: Energy Loss and Associated Ecological Pyramid 
                Another observation regarding energy flow through food chain or web is that some amount is 
                lost at each stage of transfer. This forms the basis of the second law which states that “no 
                transformation of energy is 100% efficient; there is always some loss of energy as heat”. This 
                implies that not all of the energy stored in the preceding organism is passed over to the next 
                organism that consumes it. Rather, only about ten (10%) of the energy stored at one trophic level 
                is transferred and stored in useable form in the bodies of organisms at the next trophic level. This 
                principle is called ecological tithe or 10% rule. This meagre amount of energy is transferred 
                because; 
                 Part of the energy is used by the organism for life processes such as for growth, 
                movement and reproduction. 
                 Part of it is lost as heat to the environment as a result of various activities performed by 
                the organism. 
                 Some food materials remain undigested (wood, bones, etc) and are lost immediately, a 
                process called egestion. 
                 Some of it is passed out as waste products by the organism for example through 
                respiration and in excreta.

                Lesson 22: Trophic Levels 
                A. Meaning and Illustration 
                A trophic level refers to the feeding position of an organism in a food chain. Most food chains 
                have three or four trophic levels, each of which regroups organisms with the same feeding habit 
                (i.e. plant eaters, meat eaters, etc).  
                B. Stepwise nature and limitations of trophic levels 
                The following are the different trophic levels 
                 The first trophic level (T1) is composed of all the green plants (producers) which 
                manufacture food energy through photosynthesis. 
                 The second trophic level (T2) consist of all herbivorous animals (primary consumers) that 
                feed on the plants to gain energy. For example, grasshoppers, caterpillars, goats and rabbits. 
                 The third trophic level (T3) is occupied by carnivores or secondary consumers which eat the 
                flesh of herbivores to derive food energy. Most food chains end at this level. 
                 The fourth trophic level (T4) usually encountered in longer food chains embodies top 
                carnivores or tertiary consumers which get their energy by eating other carnivores. This may 
                also include omnivores that feed on other carnivores and all the lower tiers. 
                 The position of decomposers is a little confusing because they breakdown dead matter from 
                all previous levels to obtain energy. Technically, they do not represent a specific trophic 
                level.

                An ecological pyramid is a diagrammatic representation of the loss in energy with increase in 
                trophic level, which also includes a fall in the number of organisms and biomass. Thus it 
                embodies the pyramid of energy, number and biomass. 
                a. Pyramid of energy: This shows the progressive loss in energy with increase in trophic level. 
                It is so described because of its shape. This continuous loss of energy imposes a limit to the 
                number of organisms that can be supported at each higher trophic level as well as to the mass of 
                living organisms know as biomass.

                Figure: Estimated useable energy available at each trophic level (using 10% rule) 
                b. Pyramid of numbers: It is based on counting the number of organisms at each trophic level. 
                The normal pyramid, first used by Charles Elton in 1927 shows that the total number of 
                organisms that can be supported decreases with increase in trophic level, in response to the loss 
                of energy at each successive level. It therefore supposes that there is a small number of producers 
                or plants which support a small number of herbivores. The latter in turn supports a relatively 
                small number of carnivores. This explains why there are more plants, herbivores than carnivores 
                in this order in an ecosystem. This ensures ecosystem stability as little or no pressure is exerted 
                on preceding trophic levels by organisms of higher trophic levels. 
                However, the pyramid of numbers can be misleading when solely used as a tool of comparing 
                ecosystems. This is due to the following reasons. - - - - - 
                Parasitic food chains may give inverted pyramids with a small number of producers 
                supporting a relatively large number of consumers. This is an anomaly to the normal 
                pyramid. 
                It is difficult to count, for instance, the number of grass or algae per unit area. 
                It does not take into account the relative sizes of organisms. For example, a bacterium would 
                count the same as a fox; an algae is given the same status as a tree. 
                Moreover, the range of numbers is so great that it is often difficult to draw the pyramid to 
                scale and logarithmic scales are often used. 
                Finally, the trophic level of some organisms may be difficult to ascertain. For example, fox 
                eat both grass and meat and can be considered members of trophic levels two and three in 
                certain cases. 
                c. Pyramid of Biomass: This is based on the weight of the organisms at each level. It usually 
                considers the dry weight or ash weight. Some the disadvantages associated with the pyramid of 
                51 
                
                
                52 
                
                number like the differences in the size of organisms can be overcome by using the pyramid of 
                biomass through drying the remains of representative organisms at each level and measuring the 
                weight. The proportion between the biomass at one trophic level and that at the next higher 
                trophic level is known as the biomass ratio. 
                C. Food chains and Food web 
                A food chain is a line of organisms through which energy and matter are transferred as one type 
                of living thing or its product is consumed by another as food and is in turn consumed by another. 
                It normally moves from plants to the herbivores that eat the plants, and then to the carnivores and 
                omnivores that consumes the previous organisms. The decomposers obtain their own energy by 
                consuming the waste matter from all the other organisms. 
                
                
                
                A food web on the other hand is a more complex food chain in which some animals feed from 
                different sources or trophic levels to gain energy. In the process of transfer the energy nehaves in 
                two ways i.e. energy is conserved and transformed into various other forms and some is lost at 
                each stage. The figure below illustrates a food web.

                Lesson 23: Nutrient Cycling 
                A. Meaning of nutrient cycling 
                Nutrients refers to the chemical elements or compounds required by plants for growth and 
                functioning. There are about seventeen nutrients needed by plants in various quantities. Some of 
                these nutrients are derived from the atmosphere where they exist as gases e.g. oxygen, while 
                others are derived from rocks when weathered such as calcium and potassium. Decaying organic 
                matter also releases nutrients into the soil. 
                Nutrient cycling on the other hand also called biogeochemical cycling is the movement of 
                nutrients from the source in the natural environment through the different biotic components of 
                ecosystem and back to the source or natural environment for reuse. 
                Examples of Biogeochemical cycles 
                1. Carbon Cycle 
                Carbon is an important component of all living cells. It is important for plant growth as it is one 
                of the ingredients used in the process of photosynthesis. Thus, the carbon cycle can be 
                summerised as follows 
                 Carbon is derived from two main sources i.e. the atmosphere (it exist as CO2) and from rocks 
                (in the form of hydrocarbon compounds like petroleum, coal or calcium carbonate). It is 
                absorbed from the atmosphere by green plants and transformed into carbohydrate in the 
                process of photosynthesis. This is then passed onto the animals which consume plants. 
                Carbon is sent back to the atmosphere as animals release CO2 in the process of respiration 
                and also when plants and animals die, they decompose and carbon is released to the 
                atmosphere. Again, undecomposed plant and animal materials are transformed into fossil 
                fuels such as petroleum, coal, lignite and natural gas through the process of fossilization or 
                carbonification. Carbon stored in this form is eventually returned to the atmosphere through 
                the burning or combustion of these fuels. Thus being sent back to the atmosphere and the 
                cycle continues.

                2. Nitrogen Cycle 
                Carbonification 
                (fossilization) 
                Nitrogen is an essential element in the composition of protein, the formation of chlorophyll or 
                green foliage in plants (where photosynthesis takes place) and for plant growth. The absence of 
                nitrogen in plant causes stunted growth and yellowish leaves (chlorosis). Thus, the nitrogen cycle 
                is one of the most important biogeochemical cycles to be considered. 
                The main source of nitrogen is the atmosphere where it exist in a gaseous form, making 78% of 
                the total volume of air. It is also available in the bodies of living organisms as protein. Nitrogen 
                as a gas in the atmosphere cannot be used directly by plants and animals until it is transformed 
                into soluble forms and nitrogenous compounds in the soil. Thus, nitrogen enters the soil through 
                the following ways; 
                 Small proportions enter the soil through the effects if lightning which split the bonds so that 
                they combine with other elements in the atmosphere such as oxygen to form nitrogenous 
                compounds. These compounds can be dissolved and brought into soil in rainfall 
                 A greater proportion enters the soil through a process called nitrogen fixation. It is fixed into 
                the soil by nitrogen fixing bacteria. These bacteria may be living freely in the soil and such a 
                54 
                fixation is called non-symbiotic fixation. They may also be living in the root nodules or 
                swellings of leguminous plants. Such a fixation is called symbiotic fixation. 
                 Some quantities also get into the soil through application of artificial fertilisers (nitrates) by 
                farmers. 
                Once in the soil, nitrogen may be absorbed by plants. This is passed onto the consumr organisms 
                which feed on the plants. Within the organisms, the nitrogen is converted into protein and amino 
                acid. This is eventually returned to the soil in animal waste or faeces or when the plants and 
                animals die and decompose. 
                The product of this decomposition is ammonia (organic nitrogen). This is converted into a 
                mineral form called Ammonium through the process of mineralization. In this form, it may be 
                absorb onto the soil particles or clay-humus aggregate to be released to plant roots (later) through 
                cation exchange, or absorbed directly by plant roots for recycling. 
                This ammonium is oxidized in long cycles (combined with oxygen) to become Nitrite by Nitrite 
                bacteria such as Nitrosomonas. The nitrite may further be oxidized into Nitrate by Nitrate 
                bacteria (Nitrobacter). Nitrate is the soluble form of nitrogen required by plants and the whole 
                process by which ammonium is transformed into soluble nitrate is called nitrification. 
                Still in the soil are denitrifying bacteria which breakdown the nitrate or nitrogen compounds into 
                gaseous nitrogen (a process called denitrification). This eventually escapes back the atmosphere 
                for recycle.

                Transfer or processes 
                Biomass is the total mass of living organisms, mainly plant tissue, per unit area. It is also 
                referred to as the total organic matter found in plants and/or animals at a given time on a well 
                defined area. Better still, it is considered as oven dry weight of matter per unit area. 
                Litter is the total amount of organic matter including humus and leaf litter in the soil. It 
                therefore more than just L or litter layer as shown in the soil profile diagrams.

                Soil refers to the thin surface layer resting on the earth’s crust made up of a complex mixture 
                of mineral particles, organic matter, water and air formed by physical, chemical and biological 
                processes. 
                C. The Gersmehl Model 
                The model of mineral nutrient cycling was put forward by Gersmehl in 1976. It is designed to 
                show the ideal ways taken by nutrients to move within ecosystems repeatedly for reuse. Its 
                significance lies in the fact that it enables different ecosystems to be compared. 
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                According to the model, the cycling of nutrients involves stores and transfers. The stores are 
                places or components of the system where nutrients are held at least for sometime before being 
                exchanged. The stores serve as nutrient reserves or pools. Gersmehl identifies three main stores 
                of nutrients (Biomass, litter and soil). Each of these constitutes a sub system with its own inputs

                The size of each store therefore depends on the subtle balance between the inputs and outputs of 
                nutrients. This largely depends also on the prevailing climatic conditions which in turn affect the 
                processes which lead to gains or losses. 
                Lesson 24: Nutrient cycling in contrasting ecosystems 
                1. The Selva Ecosystem  
                Selva is a Portuguese term for rainforest ecosystem. This ecosystem lies mainly in lowlying 
                areas between latitudes 00 and 50 North and South of the equator. It is found in the Amazon basin 
                in South America; Congo basin of Africa (including Southern part of Cameroon), the coastal 
                strip of West Africa; and the East Indies. These areas experience the equatorial climate 
                characterized by high constant temperatures (about 270C on average) and heavy rainfall which is 
                spread throughout the year.  
                In this ecosystem, biomass is the largest nutrient store, while litter store is the smallest. The 
                volumes of nutrient transfers are generally the highest of all ecosystems, especially from litter to 
                soil, from soil to biomass and losses form soil by leaching.

                L 
                S 
                Figure: Selva (rainforest) 
                From the diagram above, the large biomass store is due to 
                 High temperatures, heavy rainfall and the year-round growing season, which favour growth 
                of a dense vegetation cover called the rainforest or selva. The productivity is very high, 
                (about 2200g/m2/year). This is made up of a variety of species such as mahogany, sapele, 
                iroko, etc. large volumes of nutrients are therefore drawn from the soil to meet the needs of 
                continuously growing and dense vegetation and stored in biomass. 
                58 
                 The woody species characteristic of this vegetation hold no more nutrients than annulas and 
                hence the large biomass store. 
                The small volume of transfer from biomass to litter is due to the fact that there is no 
                unfavourable season to trigger remarkable leaf shedding or fall-out of dead tissues. There is 
                therefore fairly small litter fall especially as the vegetation is not deciduous but remains 
                evergreen. 
                Litter is the smallest nutrient store in the selva because: 
                 The warm moist climatic conditions favour the rapid decomposition of litter 
                 There is a large population of soil organisms which assist in the decomposition and 
                consumption of litter. 
                 The tissues of the leaves are soft and can easily be decomposed. Consequently, there is little 
                litter build-up. 
                2. The Steppe (Temperate) Grassland 
                The temperate grassland ecosystem lies in the mid-latitude continental interiors and also along 
                the eastern coast, especially in the Southern hemisphere. These include the steppe in the heart of 
                Asia, the prairie of North America, the pampas of Argentina, the veld of South Africa and the 
                Downs of Australia.  
                These areas experience a steppe climate, which is characterized by wet and warm summers with 
                temperatures greater than 190C, while winters are very cold and dry (often below freezing point). 
                Precipitation is low about 510mm per year and falls ad rain in summer and snow in winter. 
                The nutrient cycle is characterized by a fairly small biomass store, smaller litter store, while the 
                soil store is by far the largest, perhaps of all environments. The rate of nutrient transfer is 
                moderate with the greatest being from biomass to litter, followed by transfer from litter to soil 
                while the flow from soil to biomass is the least in the system. 
                B 
                L 
                S 
                Figure: Steppe (Temperate) Grassland 
                59 
                Here, the cycling of nutrients is dominated by the interaction between the grass and the soil. 
                Uptake of nutrients from the soil is balanced by high rates of return both from the rocks and the 
                above ground part of vegetation. The moderate size of biomass is due to: 
                 The insufficient moisture due to low rainfall 
                 Low winter temperatures which combine to reduce the growing season to approximately six 
                months. 
                Consequently, productivity is lower than in the selva, being 600g/m2/year. In such conditions, 
                only grass develops comprising few species such as big blue stem, the little blue stem and black
                eyed susan. 
                The transfer from biomass to litter store is fairly large because the grass dies back during the 
                unfavourable season, in winter. There is therefore greater production of waste as grass lies 
                dormant and during this period, much of the biomass exists below the surface as rhizomes and 
                roots. 
                The litter nutrient store is small because litter steadily decomposes into humus owing to a fairly 
                large population of soil organism and nutrients are released to the soil. The soil here is the largest 
                store of mineral nutrients, perhaps of all ecosystems because of the following; 
                 There is little leaching of the soil due to the insufficient rainfalls  
                 High evaporation rate helps to draw additional nutrients for example, calcium and potassium 
                salts through capillary action towards the surface. 
                 The climate is conducive to both chemical and physical weathering which releases further 
                nutrients from the parent rock. 
                On this basis, the soil retains much of the nutrients and the result is a highly fertile soil called 
                chernozem or black earth and prairie soils often associated with temperate grasslands. 
                3. The Taiga (Coniferous Forest) Ecosystem 
                Taiga is Russian word for coniferous forest ecosystem. This ecosystem is found only in the 
                Northern hemisphere, between latitudes 450 and 650 N. the southern hemisphere is more oceanic 
                and continents do not extend far into corresponding latitudes. It occurs in the following areas: 
                Northern part of Eurasia, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific covering Scandinavia 
                (Sweden and Finland) and Northern Russia, North America from Pacific to Atlantic Coast, 
                stretching from Alaska to Newfoundland. 
                These areas experience the cool temperate continental climate also called Siberian type. It is 
                characterized by long cold severe winter (8 months) when temperatures are usually below 
                60 
                freezing point (below -680C) and short summer (4 months) when temperatures may go slightly 
                above 180C. Precipitation is low (about 530mm) but occurs throughout the year. It falls as snow 
                in winter and rain in the short summers. 
                These conditions largely determine the nutrient cycle characterized by a very large litter store, 
                relatively small biomass, while the soil store is the smallest. Volumes of transfer are generally 
                low and slow especially from litter to soil and from weathered rocks to soil. 
                B 
                L 
                S 
                Figure: Taiga (Coniferous forest) Ecosystem 
                From the diagram above, the fairly small biomass is due to: the short summer and long severe 
                winter which limit not only the type of plant but species variety. The productivity is low, about 
                900g/m2/year. Although forest, the biomass is relatively low because the coniferous trees contain 
                a limited number of species which are adapted to the cold conditions such as fir, pine, spruce and 
                larch. The vegetation has only one layer with little undergrowth. Consequently, very small 
                quantity of nutrients are drawn from soil and stored in biomass. 
                Litter remains the largest amount of nutrients because of: 
                 The very low temperatures for most of the year which restrict the number and activity of 
                decomposers. 
                 The nature of litter composed of stunted needle leave of conifers with thick cuticles is 
                difficult to breakdown. 
                Consequently, the rate of decomposition is very slow and nutrients are continuously locked up in 
                the litter layer for a long time. This also explains the very small transfer from litter to soil. 
                The very small soil store is explained by heavy losses through leaching and cheluviation. 
                Leaching is high because, although precipitation is low, there is little evaporative loss due to the 
                low temperatures. There is therefore, sufficient water left especially as it is accompanied by 
                snow melt in summer to cause intensive leaching. Thus, large volumes of nutrients or bases are 
                61 
                removed from the soil alongside iron and aluminum oxides (podzolisation), giving rise to the 
                podzol soils with an ash-grey surface layer and low nutrient content. 
                Lesson 25: Nutrient cycling and ecosystem management 
                A. Meaning of Ecosystem management 
                Ecosystem management has varied definitions and the approach is still debatable. Narrowed to 
                its basic essentials, it refers to an approach to natural resource management which aims to sustain 
                ecosystems to meet both ecological and human needs at the present and in the future. Summarily, 
                it is an approach that will protect the environment, maintain healthy ecosystems, preserve 
                biological diversity and ensure sustainable development.  
                This approach is has seven core principles or pillars which guides it and provide operational 
                meaning to it. These principles include: 
                 Ecosystem reflects a stage in the continuing evolution of social values and priorities; it is 
                neither a beginning nor an end. 
                 Ecosystem management is place-based and the boundaries of the place must be clearly and 
                formally defined. 
                 Ecosystem management should maintain ecosystems in the appropriate condition to achieve 
                desired social benefits; 
                 Ecosystem management should take advantage of the ability of ecosystems to respond to a 
                variety of natural and man-made stressors, but all ecosystems have limited ability to 
                accommodate stressors and maintain a desired state; 
                 Ecosystem management may or may not result in emphasis on biological diversity. 
                 The term sustainability if used at all in ecosystem management, should be clearly defined
                specifically, the time frame of concern, the benefits and costs of concern, and the relative 
                priority of the benefits and costs; and 
                 Scientific information is important for effective ecosystem management, but is not only one 
                element in a decision-making process that is fundamentally one of public and private choice. 
                On the basis of this principles, Robert T. Lackey defines ecosystem management as “the 
                application of ecological and social information options, and constraints to achieve desired social 
                benefits within a defined geographic area and over a specified period”. More precisely, it implies 
                the applicatio0n of ecological science to resource management to promote long-term 
                sustainability of ecosystems and the delivery of essential ecosystem goods and services. 
                62 
                B. How nutrient cycling enable ecosystem management 
                Nutrient cycling is one of the processes that enables life to be sustained in ecosystems. It also 
                links the different components of the ecosystem together such as the soil, vegetation and the 
                atmosphere (climate). Thus, if any of the components is destroyed, the entire ecosystem would 
                be damaged. Consequently, humans would no longer derive the benefits provided by ecosystems.  
                We would help to keep our ecosystems healthy to continue provide our needs, if the various 
                ecosystem processes and components, which serve as stores of nutrients are well managed and. 
                This comprises of: 
                 Better management of soils through the use of sustainable farming methods such as contour 
                ploughing, crop rotation, planting of vegetation to cover the soil and the application of 
                organic manure and other soil additives where the fertility has dropped. In the steppe 
                ecosystem for example, the soil is the largest store of nutrients. For better management 
                therefore, the soil here must be a priority. 
                 Better management of vegetation and fauna, which are nutrient stores (biomass). Vegetation 
                is the largest store of nutrients in the tropical rainforest ecosystem. 
                C. How man can use knowledge of nutrient cycling to foster ecosystem management 
                It follows that the conservation of vegetation is fundamental in ecosystem management and some 
                of these measures include; 
                 Creation of forest reserves. For example, in Cameroon these include the Kimbi Reserve 
                (4000ha), the Faro Reserve (335,000ha), the Dja Reserve (520,000ha), the Campo Reserve 
                (300,000ha). 
                 The creation of National Parks such as the Waza park, the Bouba-Njida Park, the Benue 
                Park, Korup Park, etc. 
                 Improvement of natural pasture by planting of more nutritive grasses for grazing animals. 
                 Instituting legislation to regulate the exploitation of natural resources such as the Forestry 
                Law in Cameroon. 
                63 
                Lesson 26: Productivity of ecosystems 
                A. Meaning  
                Productivity of ecosystems refers to the rate of energy production or rate of creation of organic 
                matter per unit area and time. It can also be seen as the rate of conversion of energy in ecosystem 
                into organic matter. It is often measured in tons, grammes or kilocalories of energy per unit area 
                on an annual basis (per year) and mostly reflected in the size of biomass. The higher the 
                productivity, the greater would be the biomass of an ecosystem and vice versa. 
                B. Types of Productivity  
                Energy can be converted into living matter primarily by plants (producers) and secondarily by 
                animals (consumers). On this basis, two main types of productivity have been distinguished as 
                follows; 
                1. Primary Productivity: It is the rate of creation of organic matter by producers or green plants 
                per unit area and time. This is achieved through photosynthesis and for this reasons, primary 
                productivity can also be defined as the rate of photosynthesis in a given area or the rate of energy 
                fixation by plants in a given community. There are two subtypes of primary productivity namely; 
                gross primary productivity and net primary productivity. (See details below) 
                2. Secondary Productivity: It is the productivity of consumer or heterotrophic organisms i.e. the 
                energy converted into living matter by animals. 
                C. Measurement of Ecosystem Productivity 
                Productivity of ecosystem can be measured using the following criteria 
                a. Gross Primary Productivity (GPP): It is the total amount of organic matter or energy made 
                by plants i.e. the total amount of photosynthesis per unit area and time. It can also be defined as 
                the total solar energy bound in plant tissues per unit area and time. The total energy produced 
                and minus the one used by plants is called net primary productivity 
                b. Net Primary Productivity: It is the amount of energy that is left after losses through 
                respiration of plants. It is the net accumulation or increase of energy. It also appears as the 
                increase in the living weight of plants and by extension can be considered as an increase in the 
                biomass in an ecosystem. In summary, NPP is the energy or matter in plants which is available 
                for the primary consumers. It is measured by subtracting used energy (respiration) from GPP i.e.

                65 
                
                D. Productivity of different ecosystems and reasons 
                Productivity varies from one ecosystem to another. At a global scale, contrast can be made 
                between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Generally, terrestrial ecosystems have a higher 
                productivity because of the availability of nutrients stored in soil, more plants to photosynthesis 
                than aquatic ecosystems. The latter has little or no soil to store nutrients, little photosynthetic 
                surfaces and most are saline. However, differences still exist within each of the aquatic and 
                terrestrial ecosystems. 
                For aquatic ecosystems and within the ocean for example, productivity tend to vary depending 
                on; water depth, water freshness and proximity to the land from where nutrients are washed to 
                the adjacent waters. There is a decline in productivity from the coast to the open ocean. Estuaries 
                (swampy low lying areas at the mouths of rivers into the sea) have high productivity because of 
                availability of nutrients washed from surrounding land and constant input of fresh water which 
                helps to reduce salinity. Continental shelves also have fairly high productivity because of similar 
                reasons. 
                With regards to terrestrial ecosystems, there is a general decline in productivity with some 
                exceptions from the equator towards the poles. The rainforest has the highest productivity 
                (2200g/m2/year) while deserts have the least (90g/m2/year). This explains why there are more 
                kinds of life forms (biodiversity) in the tropical rainforest region than in any other terrestrial 
                ecosystem in the world. 
                The reasons which accounts for this disparity in productivity are: 
                 Differences in the supply of nutrients 
                 Differences in moistures content 
                 Temperature differences and  
                 Differences in light energy over the earth’s surface

                E. Factors of ecosystem productivity 
                1. Climate: This is seen through the elements of weather and climate. They include 
                a. Light: Light to ecosystem is provided by solar radiation. It is like the driving force of 
                ecosystem through the influence of photosynthesis. Thus, towards the poles, productivity reduces 
                as the amount of light reduces whereas in the tropics, productivity in higher because of increase 
                sunlight. 
                b. Precipitation: It determines the rate of chemical reaction through soil moisture, leaching, 
                upward translocation and plant uptake. In low latitudes, there is high precipitation and 
                temperatures which favour productivity, a situation which is a reverse in high latitudes. It should 
                however be noted here that, too much rainfall will lead to soil erosion and leaching which in turn 
                reduces ecosystem productivity. 
                c. Temperature: The rate of chemical reaction is often determined by temperature e.g. the rate 
                doubles for every 100C increase in temperature. Thus, high temperature means higher creation of 
                organic matter and vice versa. Again, areas of extreme high temperatures will lead to high 
                evapotranspiration, thereby reducing soil moisture and the rate of plant growth. On the other 
                hand, very low temperatures will cause frosty conditions which are not good for plant growth. 
                d. Wind: Areas with strong winds will turn to destroy the exiting ecosystem through off rooting 
                of plants and soil erosion by wind. This will reduce the productivity of ecosystems through the 
                damage caused by winds. 
                2. Soil minerals/Nutrients:  Deep chemical weathering provides soil minerals which are 
                absorbed by plants during photosynthesis. Soil nutrients are more in selva vegetation leading to 
                high productivity. The reverse is true with the taiga ecosystem. 
                3. Amount and size of photosynthetic surface:  Productivity is generally higher in forest 
                vegetation than grassland because of larger photosynthetic surfaces of the forest. Photosynthesis 
                takes place on the green pigments of plants called chlorophyll. Thus plants with enough quantity 
                of chlorophyll in the leaves will be highly productive than those with limited chlorophyll. 
                4. 
                Anthropogenic factors: Man’s activities through overgrazing, overcropping, and 
                deforestation will lead to less productivity of ecosystems and vice versa. Man’s use of fertilizers 
                and other chemicals, crop rotation, use of improved seeds, intensive farming will increase 
                ecosystem productivity.

                A. Meaning 
                Practical Work 2 
                Measurement of Ecosystem Productivity 
                 Tables with Gross Productivity, Respiration and surface areas/Bar graphs showing 
                productivity of different biomes 
                + Calculate Net Productivity 
                + Calculate net productivity per unit area 
                 Interpret the results and classify the ecosystems according to Net productivity per unit 
                area 
                 Give reasons for the differences established 
                Biomes are large terrestrial ecosystems. They are often given the names of the dominant 
                vegetation type in the region. Each biome is made up of specific plant and animal communities, 
                climate and soil that are unique to the area and different from those of other ecosystems. 
                Although there is no consensus on the exact number of biomes, Goudie suggested 8 land biomes 
                and include: the rainforest biome, tropical grassland, desert, Mediterranean, deciduous forest, 
                temperate grassland, coniferous forest and Tundra. Their distribution corresponds to the major 
                climatic regions of the world. 
                B. Classification in terms of: 
                1. Climatic characteristics 
                67 
                a. Tropical climate: The tropics are regions of the earth that lie roughly in the middle of the globe 
                i.e. between the latitude lines of the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The climate 
                of the tropical regions of the world is characterized by a monthly average temperature of 250C to 
                280C all year round. Rainfall averages 2000mm per annum with some places receiving more. 
                This climate has two main seasons i.e. the wet season and the dry season. 
                b. Temperate climate: These are regions found between the tropics and the polar zones i.e. from 
                latitudes 23½0 to 66½0 North and South of the equator. This zone has average temperature 
                between 0 and 200C and it rarely experience extreme temperature and precipitation. This zone 
                has four seasons which are summer, winter, autumn and spring. Rainfall varies greatly with 
                increase in latitudes i.e. higher at the subtropical zone and decreases towards the poles. The 
                climate of this zone is largely influenced by latitudinal extent, relief, continentality and winds 
                and ocean currents. 
                c. Polar Climate: The Polar Regions are characterized by a lack of warm summers but with 
                varying winters. Every month in a polar climate has an average temperature of less than 100C. 
                These regions cover more than 20% of the earth surface. These climate consist of cool summers 
                and very cold winters which results in treeless tundra glaciers or a permanent or semi-permanent 
                layer of ice. Two sub types of climate can be distinguished here i.e. tundra (characterized by 
                having at least one month whose average temperature is above 00C) and an ice cap climate (has 
                no months averaging above 00C). 
                2. Vegetation Characteristics  
                a. Forests: This is a plant community dominated by trees of various sizes and heights depending 
                on the area where it occurs. Forest vegetation is believed to form the climax vegetation of most 
                forest communities. Forests are predominant in the tropical and temperate regions of the world. 
                In the tropical regions for example, the dominant vegetation is forest made of very tall trees of 
                about 50m tall (evergreen forest), with very broad leaves, etc. Other examples of forest 
                vegetation around the globe include; deciduous forest, coniferous forest, montane, mangrove, 
                etc. 
                b. Grasslands: This is a vegetation types which is mostly dominated by grass though there might 
                be a mixture of trees in some areas. It exist in the tropics (tropical grassland, desert) and 
                temperate regions (temperate grassland, etc) of the world. 
                c. Scrublands: Scrublands are areas which are dry and hot during summer but saved from 
                becoming deserts by cool, moist winters. The vegetation here has adapted to the arid conditions. 
                68 
                The plants are typically thick and have waxy leaves that have developed to store moisture. The 
                trees which grow in this biome include hardwoods like oaks and varieties of both deciduous and 
                evergreen trees such as olives and cedars. Flowering shrubs like manzanita grow into the dense 
                evergreen thickets. The summers in this vegetation are very dry, and most plants are dormant 
                until the winter rain starts. 
                Lesson 28: Characteristic of tropical Biomes 
                A. Tropical Rainforest (Selva) 
                a. Location: It is found in areas between latitudes 0o and 5o north and south of the equator. It 
                occurs in the Congo basin including the southern Low plateau of Cameroon, the Coastal lowland 
                of West Africa, the Amazon Basin in South America, and South East Asia (Indo-Malaysian 
                archipelago).  
                Areas of tropical rainforest biome 
                b. Characteristics  
                1. Climate   
                These areas experience the tropical rainforest climate also called the equatorial climate. This 
                climate has the following characteristics:  
                69 
                 High temperatures throughout the year of about 27oC on average but a low temperature range 
                of just about 3oC. 
                 High rainfall of more than 1500mm per annum that is spread throughout the year. 
                 However, there are two periods of heavy rainfall around March and September, and two 
                periods of low rainfall around August and December.  The peak periods correspond to the 
                equinoxes when the sun is over head at the equator to cause air to rise for condensation to 
                occur. The dry period corresponds to the solstices when the overhead sun is away from the 
                equator.  
                 Relative humidity is high, usually above 60%. 
                 Summarily, the climate is often described as warm and moist. 
                2. Soil  
                The main type of soil in the selva is ferralitic soil. It has the following features  
                 Very deep profile caused by deep chemical weathering. The year round warm moist climatic 
                conditions favour rapid and deep chemical weathering. 
                 Reddish-brown colour due to the presence of insoluble oxides of iron and aluminium, which 
                are not leached. The soils become yellowish with depth. 
                 Contain rock-like masses called laterites within the profile. They are formed when iron and 
                aluminium oxides become too concentrated. This often makes ploughing and plant root 
                penetration difficult. 
                 Clayey in texture due to the dominance of chemical weathering. 
                 Low nutrient content due to intensive leaching given that rainfall is heavy throughout the 
                year.  
                 Acidic due to leaching of nutrients. 
                3. Vegetation  
                The warm and moist climatic conditions have favoured the growth of vegetation dominated by 
                trees called tropical rainforest. It has the following characteristics 
                 It is thick with little undergrowth. 
                 It is made up of many kinds of plant species of hardwood growing together such as 
                mahogany, ebony, obeche, greenheart and palm etc.  There are more than 200 tree species 
                per hectare. 
                70 
                 The vegetation is stratified into three main layers. This consists of a top layer of tall trees of 
                over 50m, the middle layer of usually young individuals of the emergent species (20-30m) 
                and sparse ground layer of few herbs and shrub in the shade. This layer arrangement is the 
                result of the upward struggle for sunlight.  
                 It has broad evergreen leaves since water and heat for growth are available throughout the 
                year. The trees are never leafless.  
                 The trees are tall with branchless trunks to search for sunlight. Branches only develop at the 
                uppermost part of the trunk. 
                 The trees have large buttress roots which stand above the ground to support their great height 
                and heavy weight.  
                4. Animal life  
                There are many kinds of animals and birds given the variety of plants and food available. These 
                include monkeys, apes, gorillas, elephants, lions, squirrels and a variety of bird species. 
                5. Resources of the Selva Biome and Human Activity    
                Resources  
                They include  
                 High temperatures year round and ample sunshine which provide potentials for solar energy 
                production. 
                 Abundant rain-water year round. 
                 Hardwood and timber from the dense forest. 
                 Medicinal plants from the forest. 
                 Variety of food resources such as fruits and eru.  
                 Less fertile but deep ferralitic soils for tuber and tree crop cultivation. 
                 Different animals for beef. 
                 Mineral-rich subsoil. 
                Human activity 
                 Agriculture: Though with a low nutrient content, the deep ferralitic soils have favoured 
                various agricultural practices in the area such as shifting cultivation and plantation 
                agriculture involving palm oil, rubber and cocoa production. 
                71 
                 Lumbering: The variety of tree types mainly of hardwood of economic importance have 
                favoured lumbering. These are exploited mainly by foreign owned companies for export and 
                for the construction of houses, railways and the making of furniture.  
                 Harvesting and hunting of food and animals: A variety of food resources such as fruits 
                and eru are also harvested for home consumption and for sale. Most of the inhabitants of the 
                forest are also involved in hunting. This is because of the many species of animals found 
                here. 
                 Tourism: The presence of giant trees and a variety of animal species serve as major tourist 
                attractions. The setting up of sanctuaries and forest reserves to safeguard this ecosystem has 
                further favoured tourism. For example, the Dja forest reserve and the Mfou sanctuary in 
                south and centre regions of Cameroon respectively are great tourist attractions. 
                 Mining: There are a variety of minerals within the subsoil of the selva ecosystem which have 
                favoured the mining in some areas e.g Tin mining in the Amazon basin. 
                 Exploitation of medicinal plants: Medicinal plants from the forest are harvested and 
                concocted to treat various ailments or illnesses. The pygmies are efficient traditional healers.  
                6. Challenges and Possible Solutions 
                Challenges

                1. Many diseases affecting people, crops and 
                animals due to hot humid conditions e.g. 
                malaria, sleeping sickness, river blindness, etc 
                Sensitization on cleanliness, setting up more 
                hospitals or clinics, use of pesticides and 
                insecticides.

                new fields where land is available. 
                3. Rapid deforestation 
                Reafforestation and afforestation; passing laws 
                to restrict felling of trees without a license, 
                creation of forest reserves e.g the Dja reserve 
                in Cameroon. 
                Unlawful hunting or poaching which 
                reduces biodiversity.

                B. Tropical Grassland (Savanna) 
                a. Location: It is located between latitudes 5o and 15o north and south of the equator. It lies 
                between the rainforest and hot desert biomes. These include the Savannah of West, Central and 
                East Africa (covering the Western Highlands and Adamawa Plateau of Cameroon), the Campos 
                of the Brazilian Highlands, the Ilanos of the Orinocco basin and the Savannah of Northern 
                Australia.  
                Areas of tropical grassland biomes 
                b. Characteristics  
                1. Climate  
                The climate of this biome is called the Tropical Continental Climate. It has the following 
                features  
                 It is a hot climate having two distinct seasons namely; the wet and dry seasons of varying 
                lengths. 
                 Temperatures are high with an annual mean of 21oC but a high annual temperature range of 
                about 11oC.  
                 Rainfall is moderate to low, hardly above 1500mm per annum. It decreases from 1500mm 
                near the rainforest border to about 500mm at the border with the tropical desert. 
                73 
                 Rainfall is concentrated only in the wet season, which is longer near the rainforest (9months) 
                but decreases in length to barely 2-3 months at the desert margins. 
                 Drought is common when the dry season is prolonged.  
                2. Soil 
                There are two types of soil in the savannah namely: ferruginous soil in wooded savannah zone 
                with longer rainy season; and tropical black soil in some areas such as scrub savannah with 
                shorter rainy season.  
                 Ferruginous soil is leached with low nutrient content. It contains within its profile rock-like 
                masses called laterites makes cultivation difficult. These are oxides of iron and aluminium 
                which have hardened up to alternating wet and dry seasons.  
                 Tropical black soils are not leached since they are found in the drier parts of the savannah. 
                They are fertile soils due to upward movement of minerals or nutrients through capillarity 
                from the rocks and layers below.  
                3. Vegetation  
                The vegetation is known as the Tropical grassland or Savannah. it has the following 
                characteristics  
                 The vegetation is made up of mainly grass with scattered trees and shrubs. Since it is a 
                mixture of grasses and trees, it is preferably described as woodland. Plant species include 
                elephant grass, acacia, fig tree and baobab. 
                 It changes in form as an adaptation to the reduction in the amount and duration of rainfall as 
                one moves from the border with the rainforest to the desert margins. The three subtypes 
                include; Guinea, Sudan and Sahel Savannas.  
                 The Guinea Savannah is more wooded with tall grass mainly of elephant grass. It is found 
                next to the tropical rainforest where rainfall amount is higher (1000m to 1500mm) and the 
                rainy season is longer (about 9 months). 
                 The Sudan savannah consists of continuous grass cover mixed with shorter trees. It lies next 
                to the guinea savannah where rainfall reduces to between 500 and 1000mm and the wet 
                season lasts only for about 4 to 5 months.  
                 The Sahel Savannah is the most dried type made up of patches of grasses separated by bare 
                ground and small thorny bushes. Rainfall here is low (300 to 500mm) and the wet season 
                shortest (3 months only).  
                74 
                 Most of the trees are deciduous. This means they shed their leaves during the dry season to 
                reduce loss of water through transpiration. 
                 Others, such as the Baobab, have large trunks to store water for use during the dry periods.  
                 Some grasses avoid drought by remaining inactive or dormant during the dry season. The 
                leaves dry off and die but the root s and seeds and remain dormant and germinate at the start 
                of the wet season.  
                 Most of the plants such as acacias have long and deep roots to search for water in the moist 
                rock layer below the surface in the dry season.  
                 Conclusively, most of the plants growing in the savannah are xerophytic (Xerophytes). That 
                is, adapted to grow in dry conditions.  
                4. Animal life  
                The animals are herbivores such as zebra, giraffe, rhinoceros, antelope, and elephant. Carnivores 
                like lion, tiger, leopard, hyena and lynx also exist to prey on the herbivores.  
                5. Resources of the savannah Biomes and  Human Activity  
                Resources  
                The resources offered by the physical milieu include:  
                 Abundant grass for pasture. 
                 Wood and timber from the scattered trees. 
                 The high temperatures year round. 
                 Rain water during the wet season. 
                 Fertile tropical black soils and less fertile ferruginous soils. 
                 Different animals for beef etc. 
                Human activity  
                 Livestock farming: The abundant grass is the major resource that is used as pasture for 
                animal rearing. The animals reared include cattle, sheep, goats and horses. Mainly traditional 
                methods are used to rear animals. This involves pastoral nomadism by which the herders and 
                animals move from place to place in search of fresh pasture. This is because rainfall is 
                seasonal and fresh pasture is scarce during the dry season.  
                 Arable farming: mainly crops which require little water to grow are cultivated. These 
                include cereals or grain crops such as maize, millet, sorghum; as well as legumes such as 
                groundnuts and beans.  Cotton is one of the export crops.  
                75 
                 Tourism: it is another human activity in the savannah. This is due to the presence of wildlife 
                and the creation of national parks e.g. the Waza national park in northern part of Cameroon. 
                 Few industries have been set up which use mainly the crop and animal products as raw 
                materials e.g. textile (using cotton) and leather (animal skin) manufacturing and food 
                processing. 
                6. Challenges and Possible Solutions 
                Challenges  
                Actual or Possible measures/solutions 
                1. Drought and irregular rainfall 
                Tree planting, boreholes to provide water, use 
                of drought resistant species, irrigation of farms, 
                etc. 
                2. Desertification  
                3. Poor ferruginous soils 
                Same as above 
                Use of organic manure and fertilizers, shift to 
                livestock rearing than arable farming. 
                4. Locusts and tsetse flies are common insects 
                which attack crops and animals  
                Use of pesticides  
                C. Hot Deserts 
                a. Location: It is located between latitudes 15o and 35o north and south of the equator. Examples 
                of tropical deserts include the Sahara Desert, Kalahari and Namib Desert in Africa, Arabian 
                Desert in the Middle East, Thar Desert in India, Atacama Desert in South America, Mohave or 
                Californian Desert in USA and the Great Australian Desert.

                Areas of tropical Hot Desert Biomes  
                b. Characteristics  
                1. Climate  
                2. Soil  
                Desert soils have the following characteristics: 
                It has the hot dry tropical climate with very high temperature (mean annual temperature is 32oC). 
                Rainfall is low and irregular. The annual rainfall is 250mm.  
                 Have very shallow profile, measuring only few centimetres from the top to the bottom of 
                their profiles. 
                 They have brownish-grey to white colour due to their high lime and salt content. 
                 Desert soils are devoid of soil water. 
                 They have very little or no organic matter due to an absence of vegetation cover. 
                 The B horizon is made up of an accumulation of gypsum and salt.  
                 The C horizon is partially decomposed. Generally, horizons are poorly differentiated and 
                inconspicuous in desert soils. Because of the high lime content, the soils would be able to 
                support crops for a long time if they are carefully irrigated. The major problem is therefore 
                77 
                the lack of soil water. Its saline content also poses a problem because this hinders plant 
                growth. 
                3. Vegetation  
                It is made up of very scanty vegetation with a lot of bare surface. The few plants that grow in the 
                desert are drought-resistant plants called xerophytes. To survive the dry condition, the plants 
                have developed the following adaptations:  
                 Have long tap roots to search for water deep down the rocks. 
                 Have thick stem to store water. 
                 Have little or no leaves to reduce loss of water e.g. date palm, baobab and cactus. 
                4. Animal life: There are few animals due to the scanty vegetation; e.g Desert fox and snake  
                5. Resources and Human activity     
                Resources  
                 Abundant solar energy which can be exploited to provide solar electricity. 
                 Presence of minerals such as petroleum. The major oil-producing countries of the Middle 
                East are located in desert environments. 
                 Fertile soils in oasis. 
                 Some of the desert landforms such as rock pedestals, yadangs, zeugens serve as tourist 
                attractions.   
                Human Activity  
                 Pastoral Nomadism. 
                 Irrigation farming  
                 Oil drilling  
                 Tourism  
                6. Challenges and Possible Solutions  
                Challenges  
                Actual or Possible measure/solutions 
                1. Lack of water 
                Tree planting, boreholes to provide water, use 
                of drought resistant species, irrigation of farms, 
                etc. 
                2. Very hot and dry conditions 
                Use of cooling devices, wear appropriate cloths 
                to prevent the scorching effect of the sun from 
                affecting the skin. 
                78 
                3. Movement of sand storms by winds which 
                destroy and bury property 
                Clearing of sand dunes regularly, planting 
                windbreaks and tree lines around houses to 
                reduce wind speed. 
                4. Low population to attract development  
                Encourage birth rate and social amenities to 
                attract population. 
                Further Study 3 
                Ecosystem Services (benefits of ecosystems) 
                Ecosystems provide a lot of benefits to man. The concept of ecosystem services has been 
                developed to describe these various benefits. Thus, an ecosystem service is any positive benefit 
                that ecosystems provide to people. These benefits can be direct or indirect. These 
                benefits/services include; 
                1. Provisional services: These refers to the products obtained from ecosystems such as food, 
                fresh water, wood, fiber, genetic resources and medicines. These serve the needs of humans. 
                2. Regulating services: These are the services that ecosystems provide by acting as regulators 
                e.g. regulating the quality of air and soil or by providing flood and disease control, climate 
                regulation, natural hazard regulation, water purification and waste management. These make life 
                possible for people. For examples, plants clean air and filter water, bacteria decompose wastes, 
                bees pollinate flowers and tree roots hold the soil in place to prevent erosion. All these processes 
                work together to make ecosystems clean, sustainable, functional and resilient to change. 
                3. Supporting or Habitat services: This highlight the importance of ecosystem to provide a 
                home or habitat for majority of species and to maintain the viability of gene-pools. 
                4. Cultural services: These include non-material benefits that people obtain from ecosystems 
                such as spiritual enrichment, intellectual development, recreation, etc. Biodiversity, ecosystems 
                and natural landscapes have been the source of inspiration for much of our art, culture and 
                increasingly for science. 
                To conclude, without these supporting services, provisional, regulating and cultural services, we 
                would not exist.

                        ECONOMIC
                        GEOGRAPHY
                        This is the branch of geography which seeks to understand the interaction between man and his
                environment with a view of making ends meet. It is therefore the geography that studies how
                man makes a living. This is because it is concerned with the usefulness of the earth’s resources
                (soil, water, forest, minerals, etc) to man and assessing the measures undertaken by man to
                render them more useful. It therefore seeks to understand the distribution of man’s productive
                activities and to explain any pattern of distribution that may be concerned. It scope therefore
                engulfs the description and explanation of the spatial placing (location or distribution) of
                economic activities (agriculture, manufacturing, transport and trade) and their pertaining
                functional linkages.
                Economic activities are those activities undertaken and for which income is derived and through
                which man earns a living. That is to say, they all activities which necessitate income earning and
                employment with a principal characteristic being the idea of remuneration, a concept which is
                involved in the concept of income earning. For simple and better understanding, economic
                activities have been classified as follows:
                1. Primary Activities: These are mainly concerned with the extraction of raw materials from
                the natural environment without changing their form. These sector is very dominant in the
                LEDCs where raw materials are highly available. These activities include: farming, fishing,
                forestry, mining and hunting.
                2. Secondary Activities: These are activities mainly concerned with the transformation or
                processing of the raw materials into semi-finished or finished goods for consumption.
                Secondary activities include: automobile industry, textile industry, chemical industry, food
                processing industry, iron and steel industry, ship building industry, etc.
                3. Tertiary Activities: They are mostly concerned with the provision of services for the
                population. They include: transport, communication, banking, domestic services, professions
                like (driving, teaching, trading, services of doctors) and advertisement.
                4. Quaternary activities: These are activities mostly concerned with research, transfer of
                information and communication technology. These activities are important because they help
                companies to function e.g. research, arts, science and law.
                5. Quinary Activities: These are activities concerned with the control and management of an
                industrial process e.g. manager or director.

                AND
                ECONOMIC
                Lesson1:
                NATURAL
                ACTIVITIES
                RESOURCES
                A. Meaning: These are those materials or substances which exist in nature or given to man by
                nature and for which man has done nothing to bring them into existence but rather man
                utilizes them in order to earn a living. It can also be referred to as anything occurring
                naturally in the universe and for which humankinds derive some benefit without contributing
                into its existence.
                B. Classification of Natural Resources
                Natural resources as defined above can be classified into different categories based on the
                manner in which they were formed or their constituent parts (composition). Based on the
                materials behind their formation form example, natural resources can be classified into “biotic”
                (i.e. formed from the remains of death plants and animals and an example of this type is fossil
                fuel) or abiotic (i.e. formed from the remains of non-living things for example mineral like
                diamond). Here, our main focus on classification will be based on whether they are renewable or
                non-renewable.
                a. Renewable Resources: These are resources which can be renewed along with their
                exploitation and can be always available for use. That is, these resources have natural
                regeneration and are inexhaustible. Examples include forests, air, solar energy, etc.
                b. Non-renewable Resources: These are those resources which are present in finite quantities
                and cannot be renewed along with their exploitation. That is, if these resources are used in
                large scales, they become exhausted thus they are also known as exhaustible resources. Some
                examples of such resources are coal, minerals, fossil fuels, etc.
                C. Spatial variation in resource use and factors of resource use.
                The unevenness in the distribution of resources on the earth surface has rendered some areas
                with a bountiful resource base while others are lagging. This has equally resulted to spatial
                variation in the usage of resources. This is because areas which have an abundance of these
                resources tend to make more use in expense of those without these resources. It should however
                be noted that no area is completely empty rather as earlier mentioned, some areas have more than
                others and the types of resources depending on their economic value differs in concentration
                across the globe. All these have resulted to a great disparity in resource use. The following are
                some factors that have equally contributed in the spatial variation in resource use.
                1. Culture: The cultures of some areas value some resources more than others and as such,
                those valued are highly utilized while those undervalued are neglected. For example in
                the Forest zones of the Amazon and Congo Basins, forest tribes residing in these areas
                value whatever emanates from the forest hence they hold the forest in high esteem as
                compared to other resources which have little or nothing to do with the forest. This has
                created as great disparity in resource use.
                2. Population size: The number of people inhabiting an area has a great role to play as far as
                the utilization of resources in such an area is concerned. This is evident in the sense that,
                areas with a large population size tend to utilize their resources since there is enough
                manpower to extract these resources thus no resource is lying idle. But the reverse is true
                for areas with a small population where resources are underutilized based on the fact that
                the required manpower to extract and utilize these resources is lagging leading to the
                existence of idle resources.
                3. Level of technology: The level of technology of any given area will determine the rate at
                which the resources of such an area are utilized. This implies that an area with a high and
                advanced technology makes proper use of their resources since they have the
                technological knowhow to extract and use these resources to meet their demand. On the
                other hand, areas with low level of technology lack the means to extract and utilize their
                resources efficiently. Thus leading to great disparity in resource use.

                A. Meaning and Importance
                Agriculture is the oldest of man’s discovery and it has remained the most widespread form of
                human activity guaranteeing him existence this is partly because estimates holds that about 75%
                of human population is engaged in agriculture. Despite its long existence, a generally accepted
                definition is still to be arrived at. But for the sake of convenience, the following are some
                definitions attributed to what agriculture is all about.
                 Etymologically, it comes from tow Latin words AGER meaning “land” and CULTURA
                which means “to cultivate”. From this etymological perspective, it is therefore considered as
                “the cultivation of land”. This is however a very narrow and old view of agriculture since it is
                linked more to farming which is only one aspect of agriculture.
                 It has also been defined as “the purposeful growing of and tendering of crops and rearing of
                animals and the growing of fish and forest by man, either to satisfy his needs, those of others
                or both. From this perspective, two types of agriculture (subsistence and commercial) are
                discernable.
                 It has also been viewed as “all the activities or processes involved in the controlled
                production of plants (crops) and animal materials useful to man”. In order words, it is a
                voluntary action of man’s labour related to the cultivation of crops and rearing of animals
                with the ultimate aim of mass production more or less regular and of the best possible quality
                either for home consumption or for sale.
                Importance of Agriculture------
                It employs about 75% of the world’s population directly by working on the land, cultivating
                crops and the rearing of animals. It is a permanent and inexhaustible activity and if the soil is
                well managed, it becomes a flow resource.
                Agriculture is the oldest of man’s activities as it was discovered by the early man 5,000 BC. It
                supplies him first and foremost with food necessary for his subsistence. Food production
                continues to rise and yields per hectare have increased.
                Agriculture underlies many other activities in the human environment and is functionally
                related to many other topics or areas. for example, it is the basis of industrialization and
                influences industrial location i.e. food processing, manufacturing and a variety of services
                including finance, veterinary, marketing and transport.
                There can be no level of industrial development without adequate food. As a direct result of
                this, most industrial activities tend to be located in areas of food supply e.g. Pittsburg.
                Agriculture covers a significant portion of the earth’s surface either under crops, animal
                pasture or agriculture related activities as forestry. According to statistics from the Food and
                Agricultural Organisation (FAO), farmland accounts for about 36% of global land use.
                Agriculture provides the main raw materials for most industries thus guaranteeing jobs and a
                way of life for those not directly employed in agriculture. It was the agrarian revolution
                which provided for surpluses in production thus influencing the creation of the first industries.
                It plays a crucial role in the Economic Development of countries especially in LEDCs when
                it is commercial in character. It therefore brings in a lot f foreign revenue which assists in the
                economic development of these countries.--
                It equally provides income to the workers which in turn provide them with the purchasing
                power in order to acquire other needs. This place of agriculture as a leading employer in the
                world is expressed in the following words “…but of all the occupations by which gain is
                secured, none is better than agriculture, none more profitable, none more delightful, none
                more becoming to a freeman” by Cicero, De Officiis.
                Finally, it influences the pattern of industrial development and settlements. It determines
                social and economic changes in human behavior. It is functionally linked to all other
                branches of human geography.
                B. TheAgricultural and Landscape
                An agricultural landscape is a culturally humanized landscape. The cultures of various areas are
                transcribed to the land to form definite patterns which reflect the environmental conditions of
                that culture. Consequently farming patterns differ and every farming locality in the world has its
                own appearance. This is reflected in the sense that in some areas, mounds are used, in others
                ridges and in some beds and terraces.
                Factors influencing the agricultural landscape
                a. Farm size: This is the land area which is occupied by a farm which may be large or small. It
                is worth noting here that the farm size greatly affects the level of agricultural productivity or
                the economic viability. This relationship between the farm size and the level of agricultural
                productivity of the farm is difficult to access. This is because they depend on a complex array
                of variables such as population density, natural environment, economic requirements,
                methods and intensity of production, etc. Despite this, there exit a strong relationship
                between the two i.e. the larger the farm size, the greater the agricultural productivity.
                b. Farm shapes: Related to the farm size is its shape and degree of compactness. Farm shapes
                are the nature or form the farm takes on the landscape. Some farms are elongated perhaps
                along or across the valley, others are circular or squared, perhaps where many are spread out
                across a uniform landscape. Many especially those in the less developed areas both in
                developed and less developed countries are fragmented into numerous small and often widely
                scattered plots. This may be caused by economic, social, political and physical reasons.
                c. Field patterns: These also vary spatially and greatly indicate the type of agricultural
                developments. Large fields are most common in areas of flat relief and fertile soils and
                suggest where highly mechanized arable farming is practiced. An irregular overall pattern of
                fields may suggest a long history of farming perhaps where land has come under cultivation
                in a piece meal fashion and agriculture has evolved gradually from generation to generation.
                d. Farm house styles and nature: This is the way in which the farm house is built. This
                includes the roofing and building materials. Here, the building materials used in farm houses
                commonly reflects the local geology.
                e. Field boundaries: The limits of each farm from another can be marked using fences of
                barbed wires and poles; stone walls; stone lines and gutters. These can give the farm units
                near circular, rectangular shapes or even irregular shapes.
                CHAPTER3:
                THE
                AGRICULTURAL
                SYSTEMS
                Lesson3:
                INFLUENCES
                A. Physical
                ON
                AGRICULTURE
                (Factors)
                1. Climate: This is a very important or fundamental factor not only because it conditions plant
                growth and the fact that crop growth responds differently to the amounts of the available
                climatic elements (temperature, sunshine, precipitation, and wind) but also because of the
                important role it plays in soil formation. Temperature for example determines the daily
                duration and intensity of insolation received the temperature regime and wind systems.
                Temperature’s influence is through average temperature, temperature range and the length of
                the growing season (e.g. most crops do not grow where temperatures are below 60C or go
                above 300C).
                2. Relief or Topography: Relief determines the type of soils, the nature of farming and also
                significantly modifies climatic parameters. The influence of relief on agricultural
                productivity patterns is through the elements of elevation, gradient and aspect. Gradient for
                example determines the type of method and agricultural type to be practiced in an area. The
                steeper the gradient the higher the risk of soil erosion and so the soils are thinner than on
                gentle ones. Also, on steep slopes it is more difficult and dangerous to use heavy machinery
                than on gentle slopes.
                3. Geology and soils (Edaphic) Factor: All forms of agricultural activities depend on the
                essential elements of minerals the soil provides thus reference must be made to soils when
                agricultural factors are analysed. Apart from the fact that they are being heavily determined
                by rock type, soils are the result of past and present climatic conditions, vegetation, soil
                organism and man’s activities. They also vary widely in their structure, texture, depth,
                leaching, mineral content, pH value, workability and fertility, water retention and
                consequently lead to wide variations in agricultural activities. The main influence comes as a
                result of the fact that they contain nutrients which can be exhausted. Thus they act as nutrient
                pool for plants.
                4. Biotic factors (Plants, Animals and Insects): Some plants and insect influence the growth
                of plants while some facilitate the multiplication and growth by easing pollination as bees
                and butterflies, others destroy crops and even impede their cultivation in particular places.
                Thus in relation to agricultural productivity we can talk of useful and harmful insects. Some
                insects and animals as earthworms and ants break up and mix the soil thus helping soil
                development. Others like beetles, maggots, weevils and termites instead cause damage to
                plant roots, stems, flowers and fruits hence greatly reducing agricultural productivity. In
                areas where constructive ones are abundant, there is high agricultural productivity while the
                reverse holds in areas where destructive ones are abundant.
                B. Human
                a. Economic
                1. The size of the market or the level of demand: Larger markets tend to attract higher levels
                of production because of prospects of higher farm incomes. It is therefore obvious that the
                higher the demand for agricultural products the higher will be the level of agricultural
                productivity.
                2. Price and Operation cost: The cost of any agricultural product is a greater determinant to its
                production level. Higher prices normally call for few consumers consequently crops which
                attract higher prices are intensively cultivated. On the other hand, agricultural production
                incurs cost which can influence production greatly. These costs include that of hiring labour,
                buying, tools and fertilizer as well as taxes, interests on borrowed capital and duties have to
                be paid. This has a big impact on farmers because where costs rise above favourable profits,
                farming may no longer be worthwhile.
                3. Transport (communication) infrastructure: Transport plays a determining role in
                agricultural production as efficient transport is essential to farmers to move labour, seeds,
                fodder, tools, fertilizers and other farm inputs to the farm and above all in linking the
                agricultural producer to the buyer (market).
                4. Labour: Labour has become a very important factor of agricultural productivity since the
                activity changed from primitive state of agriculture to large scale production for marketing
                purposes. Where the labour force is large, larger pieces of land will be cultivated and with
                other things being equal, this will lead to greater agricultural productivity. This is very true of
                Less Developed Countries.
                5. Capital: In an agricultural system where farmers live largely from hand to mouth from day
                to-day, there is a near absence of capital. This is typical of the remote or primitive
                agricultural systems. Little or no machinery is used and little effort is made to improve the
                land with fertilisers. Contrarily, in the advanced commercial economies, farming as a way of
                life if retreating before farming as a business.
                b. Socio-cultural
                1. Customs and beliefs: These are the social habits of any community which have been handed
                down over the years. They reflect the virtues held by the people and clearly laid down
                principles vis-à-vis many activities of life particularly agriculture. Those aspects that have a
                direct bearing on agriculture are the attitudes towards farming activities and religious beliefs
                and actions. Religious beliefs and actions for example is mainly concerned with eating habits
                which vary from one place to another and this has make the type of crops grown or animals
                reared to also vary between places.
                2. Human choice: This factor varies greatly with the individual farmer, the economic system
                and even the environment in question. Most people who engage themselves in agriculture
                tend to place limit to their extent of farming. Again, in most parts of Africa, simple
                techniques such as the use of the plough have been rejected. All these have negatively
                affected agricultural productivity.
                3. Land Tenure system (Land ownership): Land tenure refers to the means by which an
                individual lays claims to a piece of land. This is one of the fundamental farming operation
                that has influence on agriculture. Among primitive people where land is communally owned,
                land tenure poses no problem. This is because in such primitive communities private
                ownership is unknown as well as the land is both held and worked by the community as a
                whole. But in areas where the concept of individual ownership is known and more common,
                either the neo-feudal (a system where rich landlords owns land and has a certain degree of
                ownership of the peasants that till his land).
                4. Farm sizes: Farm sizes vary across the world depending on the many physical, socio-cultural,
                economic and and the political factors of the area concerned. Where these factors are
                favourable, large farm sizes are present but the reverse is true in areas where these factors are
                not favourable.
                C. Government
                a. How(Method)
                i) Direct Measures: This is the active and absolute control of agricultural activities. in this
                situation, the government takes care, through a central body, of the basic production
                questions of what, where, when, how and for whom to produce. This method of influence is
                very common in place I the case of communist countries. These measures of internal
                organization of agriculture are seen in their most extreme form in the collective agriculture
                practice of the Socialist World, where the government plans and controls virtually all aspects
                of agricultural production. In these countries, all farms are state owned. It was through this
                that the former USSR from 1928 introduced the policy of collectivization that created and
                managed large state farms known as sovkhozy and collective farms called kolkhozy.
                In Cameroon, this direct control is seen in state-owned agro-plantaion complexes as the
                Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC), CAMPALM, HEVECAM, UNDA, PAMOL
                and SODERIM. Similarly in Tanzania is the ujamaa scheme that operated under the reign of
                Julius Nyerere.
                ii) Indirect Measures: This is the method used in more democratic and free societies to
                regulate agricultural activities. In this direction, government determines what and how to
                produce by use of policies and agencies. Some of these policies include
                 The policy decisions geared towards the internal organization of agriculture: These are
                implemented through financial incentives as grants, loans (especially low interest-rate loans
                may be available for land improvements, land reclamation schemes may be financed by the
                government, etc.); agricultural research and education advanced by the establishment of
                colleges and research centres; guaranteed prices and subsidies; and tax allowances.
                 Measures geared to control external trade: These are principally through means of quotas
                and tariffs on food imports. They are widely in use by areas having high-cost per unit of
                --
                agricultural product. This is particularly the case of the USA and the European Union. The
                effects of such trade restrictions is to allow small, insufficient farms to shelter behind tariffs.
                These controls are aimed to protect high cost production from low cost imports. They include
                Trade Agreements: These are very popular in the countries where the agricultural sector has
                not been liberalized. The government enters trade agreement in the marketing of their
                agricultural products. For example, the banana producing nations group themselves in the
                Africa Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Initiative to negotiate trade agreements for the bananas.
                Controlling over production
                b. Why(Reasons)
                 To guarantee an employment base: About 70% of the world’s population is directly
                involved in various agricultural activities. This proportion is higher in the LEDCs than the
                MEDCs, and hence since this the leading employment base, governments step in to regulate
                the activities so that the activity remains highly rewarding.
                 To guarantee food self-sufficiency: A popular adage holds that “it is that of the stomach
                that governs that of the head”. This highlights the importance of the need for food security.
                Governments especially in developing countries get involved in this activity first and
                foremost to ensure secured food supply. This is because food shortages have often been at the
                root of social tension in many rural areas of the developing world.
                 To guarantee revenue: Agriculture as earlier stated is a keystone to all prosperity if well
                managed. The government sees in it a reliable source of state revenue through import and
                excise duties levied on agricultural products and taxes paid by individual farmers. The
                significance of this reason is magnified where there has been greater liberalization of
                agricultural activities. This is the case of Free Market Economies as Western Europe and
                North America.
                 To ensure equitable distribution of land: As other productive resources, land is very
                inequitably distributed both in space and amongst its uses. The unevenness is accentuated
                when very productive agricultural land is concerned. This is the case of the developing
                countries at the dawn of independence. The government then steps in to redistribute the land
                in order to narrow the gap in wealth between the have and the have nots.
                 Tocurb rural exodus: Rural areas have been popularly described as ‘Agrarian workshops’.
                Once this back bone of the rural economy slumps, the cities receive massive influx of the
                rural dwellers. Governments intervene to revitalize this sector so as to render it attractive to
                the rural adult. Once this is achieved and the rural areas made attractive, the tide rural exodus
                might be stemmed. This has had remarkable successes in the MEDCs but the struggle
                continues in the LEDCs.
                 To regulate the type of production: Although agriculture yields many useful products,
                some may be converted into undesirable products. Governments intervened therefore to
                ensure that such harmful products should not be produced. In Cameroon, the government
                follows up to ensure that cultivation of “Mari Juana” is as restricted as possible.
                 Toregulate the quantity and quality of the products: In many countries if the world, the
                government is interested in the quantity and quality of products entering the market from the
                farms. For example in Denmark and Finland agricultural products must carry an official
                stamp to attest to the acceptable quality.
                Lesson4:
                SYSTEMS
                OF
                AGRICULTURE
                A. Agriculture as a system of production
                Asystem is a set of things (phenomena) linked together by the flow of energy and materials and
                working as a unit to fulfill its functions and if one component is lacking, it tends to fail. Since all
                the components of the unit are so interlinked, when any fails, is removed or is absent, the effects
                ramify throughout the unit negatively and eventually cause the entire unit to malfunction or
                collapse. The following are some examples of systems:
                 Isolated System: This is one in which there is no input and no output of energy or matter.
                Some say the universe is the sole example of this type. As such, this idea is not applicable in
                geography directly.
                 Closed system: This is one in which there is input, transfer and out of energy but not matter
                (mass). This is again not a very popular occurrence in nature and thus of limited application
                in geography.
                 Open system: This is one in which there is the movement (inputs and outputs) of both
                energy and matter. This is the most common category in nature as most environmental
                systems are open. Hence most geographical phenomena function as open systems.
                Agriculture can be examined as a system and therefore the system approach has been applied to
                its study. In the farming system, the inputs are the various variables (physical and human) that
                determine the manner of agricultural activities. The different farming activities are the processes
                which transform the inputs into farming characteristics that determine the quality and quantity of
                farm output (the various crops and animals products are the outputs). The quality and quantity of
                inputs would also determine the nature of output. Generally, if the quantity and quality of inputs
                is great, the resultant output would be of higher quantity and quality too. Some of the outputs
                may again affect inputs and processes on the farm. This is known as the feedback mechanism
                which can be positive (i.e. if causes a increase or progress) or negative (i.e. if it causes the
                situation to revert to the original or causes stagnation and decline).
                B. Basis of classifying Agriculture
                1. Original home of plants: This is based on the premise that different crops grow in specific
                climatic regions. This was one of the first and remained the most widely used general
                purpose approaches until of recent. It was proposed by H. Engelbrecht in 1930 and it
                consisted of merely a map of world climatic regions with the substitution of an agricultural
                nomenclature. On this basis, it is classified into tropical and temperate. In recent times
                advances in agricultural technology have greatly eroded the significance of the basis of this
                classification. This is because agricultural technology has made it possible for many new
                species of plants to be improved upon through grafting and pruning.
                2. Level of technology involved: This uses the basis of the methods of farming. Some
                agricultural types are highly mechanized while other reserve elementary methods of hand
                ploughing and manual reaping. Thus we see some employing highly scientific methods so
                that new species of plants (hybrid) through grafting, pruning and hybridization and animal,
                use of irrigation, glass houses. This is generally considered as capital-intensive. On this basis,
                agriculture has been classified into backward (primitive) as shifting cultivation, bush
                fallowing and advanced as horticulture, diarty and ranches and mechanized agriculture. Even
                though methods of farming are one of the major differences between regions, it is difficult to
                measure or map technology. This situation is greatly undermining the criterion and thus it is
                limited in significance.
                3. Intention of farmers: This is the measure of the degree oc commercialization. The demand
                factor is the most influential because without it, there is no agriculture. This is why demand
                forms a basis of world classification of farming types into subsistence and commercial. Some
                farmers are however meant for both home consumption and sale thereby making the criterion
                to be weak. For example peasant farmers in most parts of the world.
                4. Number and combination of products involved: Some are devoted to production of crops
                alone (Arable farming) while others for animals only (Pastoral farming). Some arable
                farming is devoted to the cultivation of several crops at a time (mixed cropping) while others
                are devoted to a single main crop. Even though this criterion seems to be satisfactory and
                simple, some difficulties are inherent. For example; many crop farmers keep poultry on the
                farm and even monoculture farms have catch crops (i.e. crops planted which mature before
                the main crop e.g. maize, coco yams planted in cocoa or oil palm farms). These all combined
                to weaken the efficiency of this criterion.
                5. The amount of inputs used: All farming activities require the interaction of some variables
                as seeds, labour, machines and chemicals on land. In situations where high amounts of inputs
                are used on small land pieces for high yields per acre, it is termed intensive farming. But
                where fewer amounts of input are applied on land of varying sizes, it is termed extensive
                farming.

                TYPES
                OF
                AGRICULTURAL
                SYSTEMS
                A. Intensive
                a. Intensive Subsistence Arable Farming: This is practiced in areas where high densities of
                population have reduced cultivable land vis-à-vis the farming population. The scarcity of
                land calls for an intensive use of the available land in order to minimize space and maximize
                output. Yields per unit area are higher than in extensive agriculture and it’s a system of
                farming in which much labour but little capital is applied on small pieces of land to produce a
                great output for home consumption. This is illustrated in the following figure

                Out put
                Characteristics of Intensive Subsistence Arable Farming
                It involves maximum use of the land thereby making neither fallow nor any wasted space
                possible. Every space of land is tilled and farm plots are separated by very narrow footpaths
                and handmade ridges so as to avoid land wastage.----
                Many farmers are tenants and have to pay portion of crops to the landlord
                It practiced in areas of very high population densities which are as high as 2,000 per km2 in
                parts of Java and Bangladesh.
                Labour use is intensive and human energy used is estimated at 2,000 man hours a year on one
                hectare of land.
                There is little or no use of machinery due to lack of financial capital to buy. Thus most tasks
                are done by the hand aided by the water buffalo.
                Farms are as small as 1 hectare due to population pressure and inheritance law that has
                established a long history of land fragmentation. In Japan farm sizes are as small as 0.6
                hectares and are even smaller in India and other parts of Southern Asia.
                b. Intensive Commercial Arable Farming: This is mainly in the form of market gardening,
                horticulture and viticulture. Market gardening or Truck farming literally means making
                gardens for the market. Specifically, it is a much specialized type of farming aimed at
                cultivating vegetables and other crops (melons and fruits) in high daily demand in nearby
                urban centres for the market. Vegetables as lettuce, cabbage, green beans , peas and carrots;
                crops as cucumbers; fruits like apples and flowers as roses, tulips and bulbs are cultivated. It
                is dominant in the developed world especially Northeast USA. But it is also prominence on
                the agricultural landscape of the LEDCs.
                Characteristics of intensive commercial----
                The farms are usually very small and in Holland they average 4 hectares. This is because it is
                practiced in areas of high population densities which make agricultural land scarce.
                It is practiced where the soils are light and very fertile. This is why it is practiced either on
                river valleys with alluvial soils, zones with volcanic soils or in areas on loess plains.
                It involves specialization mostly perishables as flower (horticulture as in Holland),
                vegetables (market gardening) and fruits (orchards of apples and citrus fruits) that are in high
                demand daily.
                It requires a large and ready market. This is why it is located around the large cities that
                provide large market or the farms are linked to them by efficient transport means.
                There is high application of crop rotation and intercropping techniques so as to maximize
                yield from each plot of land.--
                It is usually highly capital and labour intensive. Much capital is therefore applied especially
                where glass houses, heating systems and computers are involved; also where there is a great
                use of fertilizers to maintain soil fertility; and to buy high quality of selected seeds,
                insecticides and to build nurseries.
                It is highly commercialized form of farming because all produce are primarily meant for sale.
                c. Intensive Commercial Pastoral Activities: This is in the form of animal rearing and bird
                keeping. The principal types therefore are thus dairy and poultry. Dairy farming is a form of
                pastoral farming in which there is the keeping of animals (cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs)
                mainly for the production of milk for sale as liquid or processed into butter, cheese,
                condensed and powdered milk, cream. Skimmed milk or casein (raw material for making
                plastics, paint, pulp and paper). It is mainly practiced in the USA, Western Europe (Denmark,
                Australia,Britain, etc). it is still to be well developed in the LEDCs.
                Characteristics----
                It is practiced mostly in the cool temperate areas as the temperate grasslands especially in the
                zones too wet for cereal growth
                The animals are kept in lush meadows (very fresh grass) for open grazing in summer. Even
                though natural pastures are preferred, in winter they may be fed on rich pastures and man
                sown high quality fodder or stall fed in cattle sheds with hay and high quality fodder grown
                by the farmers on the farms intensively or bought.
                It is practiced near large urban centres or regions that have access to urban centres by
                efficient transport media. This requirement is imperative because its products are very
                perishable and so transport costs to the market must be minimized.
                The farms are small but capital intensive since they are highly mechanized. There is use of
                machines for milking and feeding towers exist.
                High quality species of animals are used and modern methods of cattle breeding are
                employed.
                B. Extensive Farming
                a. Extensive Subsistence Arable farming: This is one of the most primitive forms of
                agriculture today. It is a type common is areas of sparse population or where farming and
                pasture land is abundant. It is a common feature in South America, West-Central Africa,
                South East Asia. As a result of this regional distribution, it has been described as tropical
                extensive subsistence agriculture. It exist in the following sub types
                 Shifting cultivation: This is a system of farming where a patch of land is cleared and crops
                are grown within a few years and when the soil becomes exhausted, the farm is abandoned to
                region its fertility and the farmer and his family move to a new plot where a new farm is
                cleared. True shifting cultivation is carried out by nomadic tribes of the humid tropics.
                Characteristics------
                Inputs into this system are extremely limited. Only relatively few labourers are needed,
                technology is limited and capital is not involved. Thus farm holdings are small in spite of the
                vast pieces of land involved.
                The natural fertility of the land determines how long the farmer remains on the plot. Land
                and the village are abandoned when the fertility of the soil declines.
                It is practiced in areas of very low population densities.
                There is the practice of mixed cropping with crops as cassava, yams, maize etc are grown and
                some limited animals as goats and fowls for family consumption.
                There is no use of fertilisers and so there is reliance on nature and the wood ash from burned
                slashed vegetation is what fertilizes the soil.
                Out puts are very low as often what is being grown is only sufficient for the immediate needs
                of the family.
                 Bush fallowing (Sedentary farming): This is a system of agriculture where land is
                cultivated for a period of time and then left for some years to recover its fertility. It is
                actually an improved system of shifting cultivation where the farmers have a fixed central
                village. Thus the essential difference from shifting cultivation is that the family unit carrying
                out bush fallowing is now fixed or settled on one spot and then uses several permanent fields
                around, in a rotational manner. This is practiced in many parts of Latin America, Africa and
                Asia.
                Characteristics--
                It is practiced in areas of relatively higher population densities.
                Settlements are fixed and each farming community has its own land that is divided into plots.
                Land is never allowed to become a real forest or woodland. Actually the fallow period vary
                from 2 to 10 years depending on the population density. Thus as the population is
                continuously on the rise the length of the fallows is reducing too.--
                Land is cultivated for longer periods than is the case with shifting cultivation since land
                constrains are visible
                Just as in shifting cultivation, fire is used, farms are small in size and tools are crude and a
                variety of crops like maize, beans, coco yams, cassava etc are planted on the same piece of
                land.
                b. Extensive Subsistence Pastoral Farming: This is a system of animal breeding or rearing in
                which herdsmen on a daily basis or seasonal basis move from place to place in search of
                good pasture and water and escape from diseases. Movement of present day nomads is
                determined by the seasonal nature of rainfall and the need to find new sources of grass for
                their animals. Nomadic herding is practiced in different degrees of intensity from the
                equatorial areas to the Arctic. In the Savannah and Sahel zones of North Africa it is practiced
                by the Shua Arabs, Tuareg in the Sahara and Baggara in Sudan, the Fulani in Northern
                Nigeria, the Bororos and Akus in Cameroon.
                Characteristics----
                They own no land and there is movement from place to place on a daily basis with their herds
                in search of grass and fear of diseases, hence the talk of pastoral nomadism.
                Some of the herdsmen have no permanent homes and are therefore almost moving
                continuously in family groups with their flocks and herds. They build temporal huts and tents
                during the dry season.
                There may be no clear migratory pattern, but migration routes increase in size under adverse
                conditions e.g. during droughts in the Sahel.
                Mainly herbivores are reared but the main types of animals reared depend on the region
                concerned.
                Just as sedentary farmers will not sell their land unless in dire economic difficulty, similarly
                pastoralists will not part with their animals retaining them to regenerate the herd when
                conditions improve. As such much importance is attached to the size of the herd.
                NB: The extensive subsistence agriculture (Arable and pastoralism) indicate that small labour
                (man hours) and small capital (finance, quality and quantity of inputs and machines) are applied
                to large land sizes but the output per man is low. This is illustrated below.

                c. Extensive commercial Arable Farming: These are the large scale cultivation of crops that
                are geared towards the market. i.e. it is a type of farming system in which estates (large
                pieces of land) from a few square metres to hundreds of hectares are cultivated for one or few
                crops mainly for cash and export using scientific and efficient methods of production and
                huge amounts of labour. They are of two types as follows.
                i) The Family small holdings or peasant plantations (peasant cash cropping): These are
                small size plantations of a few hectares managed by the owner and his family and at times
                employing outside labour especially during farm preparation and harvesting. Here the
                cultivation is often geared to few crops and rarely one for cash and export. Examples of
                such are found in many parts of LEDCs e.g. the Mukete’s plantation in Kumba.
                Characteristics------
                Farm sizes are small (about 1 to 2 hectares) and the planting of the crops is haphazardly done.
                Labour is usually limited and provided mainly by the family, although at times during
                harvesting, labour is hired.
                The techniques and tools used for soil preparation and other farm processes are rudimentary
                (cutlasses, spades, hoes, etc.)
                There is limited use of artificial fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides.
                Inadequacy of capital to improve on techniques and purchase modern tools and other inputs.
                Mixed cropping is usually practiced where some food crops are planted in between the major
                cash crop.
                The commercialization of produce is organized by private enterprises or cooperatives.
                ii)
                Industrial or Capitalist plantation: These are very large capitalist plantations often
                covering some hundreds to thousands of hectares and are owned and run either by the
                government through a management board as Parastatals (as the case of CDC,
                CAMPALM, PAMOL all in Cameroon) or by large foreign companies as the Firestone
                Rubber Plantations in Liberia, North American Companies, etc.
                Characteristics------
                The plantations are large, well-marked out estates with roads or railways to transport labour,
                fertilisers and farm products.
                Most crops are industrial tree crops which take several years to mature (e.g. rubber takes 6
                year to yield latex, cocoa 5 years and oil palm 3 years) and are meant for export. Even though
                generally meant for cash and export, some are consumed at home as palm oil, tea, bananas
                and also some are transformed locally.
                Plantations mostly practice monoculture i.e. each estate with only one crop. This is to have
                maximum care and all the advantages of specialization of crops.
                Crops are well spaced out at equal distances apart and organized in rows. This facilitates the
                various farm operations as weeding, clearing, harvesting, transportation and disease control.
                There is significant level of mechanization involved. This is seen as there is high use of
                machines as tractors for tilling, transporting and use of aircraft for spraying with insecticides.
                Most crops are industrial crops and so need some processing or pre-transformation before
                export and consumption. E.g Tole Tea in Cameroon.
                Problems faced and attempted solutions
                 Ageing plantations: The farms are as old as from 1968 and even 1967 in the Ekona estate. As
                a result, some are unproductive, bearing few and low quality fruits thereby reducing the
                quality and quantity of oil palm products. To solve this problem, the CDC has regenerated
                some these plantations and has completely replaced others with rubber and banana.
                 Fluctuation of prices: The prices of oil palm products are not stable just like any other
                agricultural product as they are high at one time and low at another time. The possible
                solution is to have a stabilization fund and a buffer stock for pilling excess oil when prices
                and demand are low.
                 Diseases: Monoculture has invited insects, diseases and blight which attack the plantation.
                This has resulted in extensive damage and a reduction in the quantity and quality of oil palm
                products. To address this, the solution has been spraying of the oil palm plantation with
                chemicals
                 Exhaustion of the soil: Since the oil palms are perennial crops which do not favour crop
                rotation, its long cultivation on a piece of land depletes the soil of its nutrients, thus rendering
                the soils fertile. To solve this there has been great and extensive use of fertilisers and planting
                of covers crops to increase and maintain soil fertility.
                 Overripe fruits: The plantations are very large and some fruits mature and over ripen without
                being noticed. This is especially during the peak harvesting periods. These over ripened fruit
                produce fatty acids and therefore poor quality oil. To solve this, the CDC has employed
                permanent cutters who monitor the oil palm so as to harvest the nuts when they are ripe
                enough and the factories process them immediately they are harvested.
                d. Extensive Commercial Pastoralism (Livestock Ranching): This is the large scale commercial
                rearing of animals as cattle, sheep and goats with specialization on one animal, with the
                cardinal aim of meat production, even though some dairy animals are kept. This is not an
                indigenous system of livestock farming in the LEDCs in general and tropical countries in
                particular. But they are found in some parts of the LEDCs such as the pampas (Argentina and
                Uruguay), Southern Africa, West Indies and parts of Central America. In the MEDCs
                ranching is more widespread but the most significant are found on the downs and savannahs
                of Australia and the Canterbury plains of New Zealand.
                Characteristics----
                Ranches are fenced with barbed wires. This is to confine the animals to respective ranches
                thereby reducing conflicts and also the number of missing animals.
                Ranches are managed scientifically. They use the best animal breeds as pedigree imported
                from more developed areas and cross breeding is also very important and in attempt to
                facilitate this, there is specialization on one animal e.g. cattle, sheep, goat, etc.
                The animals are reared on permanent pasture whose vegetation is maintained through out the
                year by irrigation. When natural pastures are short in supply, feedstuff is cultivated on nearby
                irrigated plots and used to manufacture animal feed.
                It is practiced in remote areas where other forms of land use are limited and where there are
                extensive areas of cheaper land with sufficient grass to support large numbers of animals.
                This is because the animals are reared mainly in stations (ranches) many of which are very
                large and covering thousands of km2.
                It is carried out on richer pastures of the temperate and tropical grasslands of the world where
                there is seasonal distribution of rainfall (wet and dry). The animals however are fed on both
                natural and cultivated pastures but at fattening centres mainly pastures (alfalfa, lucernes,
                clovers and hay) and silage are used.--
                Many are owned by businessmen or large companies based in the large cities and are run by
                a manager with the help of cowboys or gauchos. Thus most of the grazing land is
                individually owned.
                It is mainly carried out in the subtropics (where cattle ranching is predominant) because of
                suitable climate which is conducive for both man and his animals.

                AGRICULTURAL
                LAND
                USE
                This model of agricultural land use and location was pronounced by Johann Heinrich Von
                Thünen (1783-1850) in 1826. He was a German economist and land owner and an established
                farmer living near the Baltic city of Rostock in Northern Germany. His ideas were published in
                his major work entitled the “Isolated State” (Isotierte Staat) and it was a catalogue of his
                experience on the farm after 40years of personal observations, deductions and well kept records.
                He titled his book the “Isolated State” because he wanted to establish for purposes of analysis a
                self-contained theory devoid of outside influences that would disturb the internal working of the
                economy.
                A. Aims and Assumptions
                Aims
                The principal aim of his analysis was to show how and why agricultural land use varies with
                distance from the market. He also wanted to discover the laws which govern the prices of
                agricultural products and the way by which price variations are translated into patterns of land
                use. He became very concerned with the effects of distance and transportation cost on the
                location of productive land. He used the following two basic models to explain his aims:
                1. The intensity of production of a particular crop will decline with distance from the market.
                (He measured the intensity of production by using the amount of input per unit of land e.g.
                amount of money, labour, manure and seeds). The greater the amount of these inputs used,
                the greater the intensity of agriculture.
                2. The type of land use or land pattern (crop type) will vary with the distance from the market.
                That is, location of agricultural activities changes with distance from the city centre.
                Assumptions------
                He assumed an isolated state with a single town (urban centre) or city in its centre. By this he
                meant the area had no external trade with the surrounding world. this isolation was due to the
                poor transport system as it existed in the 19th century.
                The centrally placed town or city was the sole market for the agricultural products of the
                region. That is, each farmer sells his surplus produce in that town and the town depended on
                the surrounding agricultural land area for supplies. The city in return ensured and offered all
                the development needs (inputs to the farm) of the whole area and also non-agricultural
                product. He stressed that this was inhabited by farmers and talking of Rural Land Use.
                At the city centre, all farmers of the same crop receive the same price for their products at
                any one time. This indicates that there is perfect competition.
                All farmers acted as rational or economic men. That is, they aim at maximizing their profits
                and have full knowledge of the needs of the market. Hence as rational men, profit motivated
                farmers adapt their output in order to maximize their profit from the single market area.
                All costs of production were equal. So any variation in total costs of farmers was due to
                differences in transport cost resulting from distance only.
                There were no physical barriers to movement across the plain. Thus cost of transport is
                directly proportional only distance and is borne by the farmer. That is, as distance away from
                the city centre increases, transport cost also increases.
                There is the existence of only a single mode of transport which was by no means improved.
                At his time, it was only the horse or ox drawn wagon or cart as transport means. This single
                mode ensured equal transport cost per km/ton.
                B. Principle (Locational Rent)
                The cornerstone of the theory is the principle of Economic Rent (ER). He said different types of
                land uses produces different net returns per unit area. Thus Economic Rent or Locational Rent
                can be defined as “the surplus returns accruing from using a piece of land for growing one crop
                rather than another” or “the surplus produced by applying labour and other inputs at a given farm
                site compared with returns obtained from cultivating the most distant land from the city”.
                Locational Rent can be calculated using the following formula
                L.R = YM–YC–YTDorL.R=Y(M–C–TD)
                Where; L.R = Locational Rent; Y= yield per unit of land; C= cost production per unit of
                commodity or crop; M= market price per unit; T= transport cost per unit; and D = distance from
                the market in km. This formula is used when all variables especially yield and market price are
                given.
                Example: If for a particular crop cultivated on a parcel of land, the yield is 10 tons per unit of
                land, market price is 40 frs per ton, production cost is 20 frs per ton, transport cost per km is 2 frs
                per ton and distance is 5km. what will be the Economic or locational rent?
                Solution: ER/LR = Y(m-c-td). (Note that td means txd) = 10(40-20-10) = 400– 200– 100= 100frs
                If the formula ER = GR– PC + TC is used, the same result will be obtained as follows:
                GR = (Y x P i.e. 10 x 40 = 400frs); Pc = (PC x Y = 20 x 10 = 200frs); and TC = (2 x 5 x 10 =
                100frs). Therefore ER = 400– (200 + 100) = 400– 300= 100frs.
                Geographical Rent is calculated using the following formula: R = (PxQ)– (PC– TC), that is,
                TR– TPC. Where R= rent, P= price, Q= quantity produced, PC= product cost, TC= transport
                cost, TR= total revenue, TPC= All costs incurred in the realization of the output.
                Factors Affecting LR (ER)
                Cost of production. The higher the cost the lower the balance from the total revenue after
                cost is subtracted. Hence LR is lower and vice versa.----
                Yield. The higher the yield, other things being equal, the greater the total revenue.
                Consequently, the higher the locational rent and vice versa.
                Market price. The higher the market price, the greater the total revenue derived from the sale
                of the output. This will lead to higher LR and vice versa if all other factors are held constant.
                Distance. This is equally important because with it, comes the notion of decay i.e. reduction.
                Greater distances increase transport cost which increases total production cost and so reduces
                LR.
                Transport cost per km/ton. The higher the transport cost the lower the LR. This is quite
                important because it is influenced by other factors as yield, weight, bulk, perishability and
                distance.
                Bulk (size or space occupied), weight (how heavy) and perishability. All these indirectly
                influence LR through their effects on transport cost. Generally, these elements tend to
                increase transport cost and so reduce the L.R.
                Cost Related to Locational Rent
                 Production cost– money spent on seeds, water energy fertilizers and other inputs.
                 Labour cost– money on wages and other man related rewards as management. Note that
                generally labour costs are higher for farms that are closer to cities because of competition
                from higher paying non-agricultural employment opportunities.
                 Transport cost– spending on moving farm inputs and outputs over space.
                 Insurance cost– spending on risk bearing and safeguarding against future failures
                 Landrent– spending to acquire the piece of land
                 Advertisement cost– spending to promote farm products and secure market channels
                 Time and inconvenience cost– these are opportunity (foregone alternative activities) and
                social (hidden or indirect defects) costs borne because of agricultural activities.
                 Storage cost– this is spending to preserve agricultural products. This is a very significant
                cost, since agricultural products are very perishable
                 Cost of energy used– this implies the labour or human energy input per hour or per day or
                per month or per year.
                C. TheSpatial Outcome of Von Thunen’s Model
                Von Thunen combined the major conclusions of his two models (both the intensity and type of
                crop production vary on the landscape surrounding the city) in his major work the “Isolated
                State” in 1826. The result was a theoretical arrangement of agricultural land uses on the
                landscape which has been popularly described as Von Thunen’s Spatial Outcome or V.T’s land
                use Rings.
                Original Outcome
                Zone 1: Very Intensive Cash Cropping: This zone concentrates on market gardening
                (horticulture) and dairying. There is the production of fresh milk and vegetables. These activities
                are nearest the city centre because they are highly perishable and so demand high cost of
                production (transport and storage) if produced far from the city. Also, the activities require high
                and frequent attention (high cost of labour as many man hours, so high cost of time) and thus
                must be near settlement where accessibility is easy. Again, they are products of high value as
                they are highly demanded at the city centre on a daily basis. As such, they can pay the high land
                rents at the city centre. In this zone, cattle are kept in stables and stall fed throughout the year.
                The land is permanently tilled and soil fertility maintained by means of manuring with cattle
                dung, compost manure and if necessary, additional manure was bought in the city and
                transported over short distances to the farm.
                Zone 2: Forestry: Wood was close to the city because it is heavy and bulky, and therefore
                needed high transport cost. Also it had great value as it had high demand as it was the main
                source of power (fuel) and building material. So it could generate high L.R to pay the high land
                rents of the zone.
                Zone 3: Intensive Arable Farming: This is a zone of intensive crop rotation. The farmer
                employs a 6 years crop rotation. Rye (important product at the market) occupied 1/3 of the land
                and the rest was given to potatoes, barley, oats, clover and vetch. Potatoes and rye were sold at
                the market. They occupy this zone because they are bulky and heavy and slightly perishable and
                so if located far from the city transport cost would be very high. Vetch was used both as green
                fodder and to help maintain soil fertility. Land was tilled permanently and there was rotation of
                cereals without fallow and the limited cattle kept was stall-fed for dairy.
                Zone 4: Less Intensive Farming: This is a zone of arable and pastoral (mixed farming) with
                emphasis on dairy products. The farmer uses a 7 years crop rotation in which rye occupied 1/7 of
                the land. There was one year of rye, one of barley, one of oats, three of pastures and one year oif
                fallow. Cattle are kept in open pastures and land is tilled only 86% at any time.
                Zone 5: Extensive Arable Farming: This is a zone occupied by a 3 field crop rotation system.
                In it 1/3 of the land was used for field crops, 1/3 for pasture and 1/3 left to fallow. Few cattle kept
                at pastures were used as drought animals and for manure production. At any time the land was
                tilled at 66%. Cereals are also grown here extensively.
                Zone 6: Extensive Livestock Rearing: This is the furthest zone and was used for extensive
                animal rearing. This activity was there because its products are not perishable, are cheap to
                transport and require large cheap land pieces which can only be obtained in the periphery. Also
                the activity requires the least human attention. as a result of the great distance of this zone from
                the market, rye suffered from very high transport cost and so did not produce high L.R. In
                consequence, the rye produced here is only for the farmer’s own consumption and only animal
                products are taken to the market.
                Another arrangement of agricultural activities on the agricultural landscape will proceed from
                market gardening, dairying, arable, beef cattle (ranching) to woodland. From Thunen’s spatial
                landscape, his conclusions are evident. These include:
                 High value, perishable goods dominate the agricultural landscape close to the market e.g.
                vegetables, dairy products while low value, bulky products as cereals further away from the
                market.
                 High land use intensities are found close to the main agricultural markets while low land use
                intensities exist further away from the markets.
                D. Applicability and Criticism
                Applicability
                The main aspect of V.T’s model that has stood the test of time is the idea of concentric zone.
                This idea is clearly seen on a small scale as an individual farm. Here, high land use intensities are
                close to the farm and lower intensities further from the farm buildings in underdeveloped areas
                as Europe’s periphery and LEDCs. In Cameroon, V.T’s concentric zone occurs around most
                villages. Vegetables and goats occupy zones nearest to the house because of great attention they
                need (weeding and watering), and quick visits for harvesting the vegetables as they are highly
                consumed. Trees come next because of the need for firewood and as they also act as wind breaks.
                Next comes the zone of cereals and tubers because these need periodic weeding. Tree crops as
                coffee is the next and lastly grazing of cattle on hills.
                Even in highly developed countries, where technology might be expected to cancel V.T’s
                principles completely, land use can still be linked or correlated with unit returns. In the
                Netherlands, the model can be linked to labour costs and amounts. Plots of less than ½ km from
                farmsteads, receive an average of 400 man-hours and at 5 km it is only 150 man-hours. this is due
                to distance decay on time. As a result of this crop types with varying attention and requirements
                are cultivated at each of these points.
                Criticisms
                1. Out- datedness: The wide time lapse since 1826 when the model was established has caused
                many elements or factors to change. There have been changes in transport modes and
                subsequently its relative costs.
                2. Over simplification: The assumptions held by Von Thunen over relaxed the complexities of
                the real world to the extent that the model appears to be remote from explaining real world
                phenomena. Also, there is no isotropic surface as very few flat, featureless plains exist, and
                where they exist, they are usually very small, contain many markets not one, have variations
                of population densities, climate and soil fertility.
                3. Improvements in transport and storage facilities: Transport was an important element of
                Von Thunen model. He assumed one mode which was backward. Although he added a
                second mode (water) in his modified model, transport has evolved greatly from those two
                modes and equally in terms of speed and efficiency. Also storage facilities have been
                developed along transportation modes as refrigerated ships, trains and planes.
                4. Static: He has also been criticized for not giving allowance for changes in many of his
                variables. His static concentric land use patterns would result if only rational framers tried to
                maximize net profits per hectare in a homogenous farming area serving a single city market.
                But conditions are bound to change in the sense that towns grow or shrink in size thereby
                changing the market situations (demand for products and so market prices. These certainly
                would change the L.R). Tastes can change and this will also affect the demand for agriculture.
                5. Failure to include behavioural factors: today, farmers do not act as economic men. They
                do not often act independent of each other. This is because movement/associations of farmers
                like cooperatives such as the Californian Trace Farming and Danish dairy Farming have
                developed since Von Thunen days. Cooperatives have enabled greater production at lower
                cost per unit.
                6. The notion of Rational (Economic) versus real man: Farmers do not have perfect
                knowledge of economic men. They do not know what the year’s weather will be when
                deciding which crops to sow and optimists may plant different crops in the situation. They
                can only guess how many other farmers would sow the same crops and thus affect the price
                at harvest times by means of the supply mechanism.
                7. Neglect for physical factors: He did not consider the effects of weather, variations in soil
                fertility and relief on agricultural productivity. Consequently he did not see them influencing
                locational rent.
                8. Failure to recognize the role of government: He failed to realize that the city is not only a
                market but also a centre of political power and economic influence.

                AGRICULTURAL
                LAND
                VALUE
                One aspect of agricultural land use that seems not to have concerned V.T was the way in which
                its use can be determined and changed in response to urban growth. This fact has made many
                Geographers to fundamentally modify V.T’s model original hypothesis and to suggest alternative
                land use patterns. One such geographer is Richard Sinclair who in 1967 coined a model which
                appeared to be a direct contrast to that of Von Thunen. Sinclair developed therefore a model in
                which agricultural land use patterns to some extent are a clear reverse of Von Thunen’s.
                A. AimandPrinciple
                Aim
                He was out to describe and explain how agricultural land values vary from the city and how
                this affects the agricultural land use patterns around the city.
                Principle
                His model is an empirical study (direct observations and then conclusions). The model was
                therefore based on experience rather than ideas or theories that are why there are no
                assumptions. In the elaboration of his model he uses the concept of urban growth. Thus he
                uses but the sociological factor. His view is expressed on the following diagram:
                This diagram shows that according to Sinclair the “value of land for agricultural activities
                increases from the city centre towards the periphery”. The higher land values will be further
                away from the city and will constitute the most productive for farming. The reason for this
                according to Sinclair is the blight effect that urban sprawl has on land values. He argued that
                cities are expanding rapidly and as a result of anticipated expansion, very little or no investment
                is made on land close to them. From this view point, as distances increases from the inner city he
                labeled the following zones:
                The inner zone (closest to city) he termed the land speculation zone or zone of speculative
                development. Land in this inner zone is more valuable for housing, commercial or transport
                development rather than agricultural use. Little investment is made in agriculture and the
                land remains under-utilised. This is followed by vacant land; field crops and grazing;
                dairying and field crops; and lastly specialist field grains and livestock. His conclusion was
                then a near complete inversion of Von Thunen’s zonations, so that the intensity of
                agricultural activity and agricultural land value increase with increasing distance from the
                city.
                B. Conclusions and Applicability
                Applicability
                The fact that it concentrates on the effects of urban growth on agricultural activities makes it
                to be quite contemporary and fundamental. This is because the implications of rapid
                urbanization on human activities remain a great challenge in modern day studies. It has been
                found applicable in the mid-west cites of USA and around British cities, where there is no
                green belt policy.
                Conclusions
                Sinclair concludes that “the efficiency and intensity of agriculture land use increase with distance
                from the city since farming activity is related to land values: the higher the land values, the more
                productive will be the farming”. Thus in direct contrast to V.T., Sinclair found that land use close
                to urban markets was dominated by low levels of agricultural intensity and that the value of
                agricultural land increases with distance from the market. It should be noted however that when
                distance becomes very significant from the city centre, land values, agricultural intensity and
                productively and the profitability of agriculture drops.
                C. Comparison with Von Thunen Model
                Similarities----
                Both are models explaining agricultural land use patterns which have been subjected to
                theorizing for a long time. The theories are based over smaller areas and locations.
                Both highlight changing agricultural land use patterns with increasing distance from the city
                (market).
                Both measure agricultural productivity with intensity of land use
                Implied in both theories is the idea of land values and profits from each activity declining
                with distance.
                They all highlight the idea of substitution of agricultural land uses with distances from the
                urban centres.
                Differences
                V.T’s model is a normative (subjective) evaluation. That is, it is based on assumptions
                whereas Sinclair’s is an empirical study. That is, a direct or real observation and so based on
                no assumptions.----
                V.T’s model held that the intensity of agricultural land use and hence value of agricultural
                land decrease with increasing distance from the city whereas Sinclair held that they increase
                with increasing distance from the city.
                V.T Used Economic factors (L.R. costs) to elaborate his view whereas Sinclair depended on
                sociological factors as the effects of urban blight on agriculture.
                V.T. emphasized on perishability, bulk, and the frequency of attending to crops and livestock
                as the basis of explaining his spatial outcome but Sinclair explains his own on the basis of
                competition from urban land use.
                V.T’s model is more applicable to backward and rural areas as well as the cities in the
                developing countries, whereas Sinclair’s model is an urban based model around cities in the
                developed world.
                Both developed their models in two geographical regions at different times. Von Thunen’s
                was in Germany in the 19th Century (1826) whereas Sinclair’s was in the USA in the 20th
                Century (1967).

                DEVELOPMENTS

                AGRICULTURE
                AGRICULTURAL
                IMPROVEMENTS:
                The
                Green
                A. Meaning:
                Revolution
                Since the beginning of the 20th century, many efforts have been made to improve agriculture
                particularly increasing the amount of agricultural productivity through more intensive and
                efficient use of agricultural land so as to keep pace with rapid population growth. These efforts
                have been collectively called the Green Revolution and it’s a term widely used but far from
                being clearly understood. In an attempt to paint its clear picture, it has been defined as:--
                The breakthrough in plant breeding that produced high yielding food grains
                Some simply holds that it is the improvement of agricultural technology in the 20th century
                and so connects it with the introduction of high yielding varieties (HYVs) of certain food
                crops, particularly wheat and rice.
                It is a continuous process of research and development in agriculture through the production
                of high yielding seeds and the making of these seeds available to farmers in an attempt to
                raise agricultural productivity.--------
                It is the effort taken by the governments notably of the LEDCs or third world, to encourage
                and improve agriculture by providing high yielding seeds and a shift from agriculture which
                uses poor land, poor quality inputs, to intensive high yielding agriculture based on the use of
                high quality inputs as fertilisers, machines, scientific methods and better soil management
                techniques.
                Aims of the Green Revolution
                To provide efficient market channels and facilities, and to ensure the efficient use of these to
                dispose of farm products.
                To provide raw materials to agro-based industries both at home and abroad
                To improve standard of living of citizens (highly heralded in Cameroon) by achieving food
                self-sufficiency.
                To raise rice output to combat what was seen then as a possible world catastrophe due to a
                population explosion in monsoon Asia.
                To increase fish and animal production, that is, to encourage integrated agriculture
                To increase national income by increasing the exports of cash crops
                To improve and make the agricultural sector more rewarding so as to curb rural exodus.
                B. Aspects
                a. Intensive use of agricultural land: This has come through the introduction of efficient
                methods of farming as soil erosion control, maintaining soil fertility, controlling drought,
                floods and extreme cold. Practices as terracing, crop rotation, contour ploughing, strip
                cultivation and the use of artificial and natural manures. Also, introduction of green (glass)
                houses, dykes and fencing. All these have increased the agricultural output throughout the
                world by 30%.
                b. Research Institutes: This is an important aspect of the green revolution and all research
                institutes are placed under the banner of the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO).
                Individual countries however have developed their research institutes to promote agricultural
                research. E.g. IRAD (Institute of Agronomic Research and Development) and IRZ (Institute
                of Zoo-technical Research) all in Cameroon.
                c. Land consolidation: In order to solve the problem of fragmentation, laws have been passed
                variedly in the different LEDCs regulating the acquisition and control of land (land tenure),
                and setting of minimum farm sizes. As a result, smaller farm sizes have been merged to
                produce large farm sizes.
                d. Hybridization: This is the greatest achievement of the green revolution. This acts through the
                modification of the genetic constitution of plants and animals so as to produce species that
                are high yielding, disease resistant and fast growing. Some of these HYVs include “miracle
                rice” or “IR-8” that grows faster and matures in 90 days instead of 110 days and the “super
                rice”.
                e. Synthetic Hormone: This is a promising aspect of the green revolution. It regulates plant
                growth and sizes making them to grow faster and healthier. So effective is it that a small
                pinch of it applied on a hectare of land can double the output since the plants grow larger and
                faster. The development of these hormones also make possible the extension, contraction or
                shifting of the growing season.
                f.
                Increase in the use of farm Inputs: This is the use of insecticides, pesticides, fungicides,
                herbicides and fertilisers. There was a general 10% increase in the world’s consumption of
                fertilisers between the 1960s and 1990s. The most commonly used types are nitrates,
                sulphates, phosphates and potash but new organic chemicals are now being used.
                C. Advantages of the Green Revolution
                 The main benefit is that it led to more food being produced so that the world output of food
                increased and saved monsoon Asia from the threat of famine. This is because where the
                package was adopted, spectacular increases in yields were recorded.
                 There is also great diversification of diets the world over especially the developing. This was
                because the green revolution led to the introduction of new crops (rice, wheat, maize,
                sorghum and millet) in different parts of the LEDCs of the world.
                 Thisincrease in food led to reduced hunger in the world notable the LEDCs.
                 There was a rise in human labour thereby increasing employment in agriculture. In India this
                was up to 111%. Employment was also created off the farm in agriculture related activities.
                 Local infrastructure has been upgraded in many LEDCs so as to accommodate a stringer
                market approach. This has principally been through the improvement of farm to market roads.
                 Thehigher returns have justified a significant increase in irrigation.
                D. Disadvantages of the Green Revolution
                 Not all farmers adopted HYVs due to high cost: This is because they needed high inputs of
                water (irrigation) and fertilizers to optimize production. As such in different parts of the
                LEDCs the rate of adoption of HYVs was not the same.
                 Rural unemployment instead increased: In India for example casual employment dropped by
                66%. This is because of introduced mechanization in agriculture, as the use of tractors in
                ploughing and planting. So efficiency has dropped by up to 25% in India.
                 The area of application of HYVs was limited in scope: This is because the adoption was
                largely restricted to areas under irrigation since the new strains of rice could only be well
                plated in lowland areas where irrigation could be used to control water supply.
                 Soil fertility is declining as HYVs use up all the soil nutrients: Even though these can be
                replenished by fertilizers, but it is quite expensive.
                 Thehybrid species of crops have inferior taste to natural ones and so are less palatable to eat.
                 The HYVs require more weed and pest control since there are more easily attacked by pest
                and diseases than traditional species.
                 It has widened in a way the scope of dependence of the LEDCs on many MEDCs as they
                rely on them for the greater and more diverse farm inputs.
                Lesson9:
                MEETING
                THE
                INCREASING
                DEMAND
                A. Global situation of food supply versus demand
                FOOD
                In 1798, Reverend Robert Thomas Malthus in his publication “An Essay on the Principle of the
                Population” postulated that the rate of population growth was faster than that of increase in food
                production. He then concluded that if this is allowed to continue unchecked, starvation would
                ensue. More than 200 years since Malthus concluded, his fears are still very visible. This is
                because even though the relationship between population growth and food supply has never been
                as exaggerated by him, food supply has always lagged behind population growth especially in
                the LEDCs where population explosion occurred. The world population is estimated to be 8.8
                billion by 2030 compared with 6 billion in the year 2000 thus pessimists hold that the world is
                moving from a period characterized by food surpluses into one of food scarcity, shortage and
                rising grain prices.
                Between 1950 and 1986 world food output increased more rapidly than did world population.
                This increase was more rapid I the developing countries, though from a much lower base than
                developed countries. Between 1986 and 1988 mainly due to below average global rainfall totals, it
                was estimated that the world’s food reserves fell from 459 million tones to 240 million tines.
                B. Waysof solving the Problem
                1. Improving farming: This is done through extensification (land reclamation) i.e. bringing new
                land into use and intensification i.e. increasing yield on land already under agriculture.
                Intensification can be ensured through intensive farming, the development of improved
                varieties and new species, farm mechanization, etc.
                2. Industrialization and search for other food: The farm areas if very effectively farmed can
                only provide a temporal solution to the ever increasing food demand. Thus it is very
                expedient to supplement extra food supply provided by agricultural progress. This entails the
                acquisition of new food from hitherto under used or ignored sources. A much underused
                source that has been recommended by food scientist is sea farming as it will ensure a greater
                consumption of fish, introduction of types of sea food once thought inedible and perhaps also
                the eating of seaweed.
                3. Improving distribution channels: Much research has revealed that the actual problem is not
                an overall shortage resulting from insufficient production but losses of a significant part of
                harvested crops through poor storage and the difficulty of distributing the right balance of
                food to where it is needed. The unevenness exist in both calories intake per person and the
                level of agricultural production.
                4. Improving on rural areas: Rural areas should be opened and made more attractive and worth
                living in. This will tie down the rural population on the land and check rural exodus. This can
                be achieved through improvement of infrastructure and providing rural credits that are vital
                to agriculture.
                5. Demographic controls: The most efficient way to solve the global food problem is through
                checking the explosive rate of population growth by using varying measures of birth control.
                This may be through a better and judicious use of contraceptives, abortion and sterilization.
                Avigorous act on population numbers will allow for a better management of smaller units.

                IMPACTS
                OF
                AGRICUTURE
                ONTHE
                ENVIRONMENT
                A. Negative and Positive
                Negative
                1. Pollution of land, air and its inhabitants: Farms chemicals are while boosting agricultural
                productivity, have through their poor application caused wide scale ecological, economic and
                health effects. This is through pollution of soils (by leaching), water courses (as run off) and
                air as vapour.
                2. Soil destruction: This is through soil erosion and soil salinization. The rate of accelerated soil
                erosion (through soil, wind and water) has increased especially as arable farming has
                replaced pastures especially on steep slopes. This has been worsen by poor farming
                techniques, deforestation, use of powerful farm machinery that compacts the soils and creates
                “tramlines” for run off. Salinization and water logging is very common in areas where
                irrigation is practiced.
                3. Loss of vegetation and habitat: Agricultural activities (use of fire, hedgerow removal,
                application of chemical fertilizers, disposal of farm waste and use of heavy machinery), have
                extended loss of the traditional landscape especially wetland, peat lands and hedgerows in
                several areas of the world.
                4. Global warming: This is through removal of the carbon sink- natural vegetation and release
                of methane (a greenhouse gas) from animal waste.
                5. Economic cost of farming is increased. This is because it now takes more water, seeds and
                pasture land to produce a pound of beef than when soils were not degraded. Again, huge
                sums are required to clean up ground water from nitrates pollution.
                Positive impacts--
                Plants necessitate evapotranspiration and consequently favours cloud formation and
                eventually rainfall
                Green plants helps to moderate the atmospheric conditions of the environment
                Improve on the natural beauty of the environment.
                B. Organic Farming
                a. Meaning
                It is a mixed farming system which involves crop rotation and the use of fallow land. This
                system therefore produces what is known as organic food of which the most important are
                market gardening products. This system involves intensive use of both land and labour.
                According to the Alberta Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development defines
                organic food as “food grown under a production system that, in addition to the avoidance of
                synthetic chemicals also promotes soil health, biodiversity, low stress treatment of animals
                and sound environmental practices”.
                b. Advantages------------
                It produces more energy than it consumes
                It does not destroy itself by misusing soil and water resources
                It favours the use of animal and green manures (compost) and mineral fertilizers (rock salt,
                fish and bonmeal), instead of artificial (chemical) fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides. This
                natural fertilizer put organic matter back into the soil, so that it can hold more moisture in dry
                weather and become aerated and more freely drained during wet periods.
                It causes very little or not soil erosion or exhaustion. This is because with it soils contain
                more organic material (humus) and soil organisms (earth worms and bacteria).
                It does little harm to the environment and human health since there is no risk of chemical run
                off to rivers particularly nitrate. There is also less loss of wildlife as there is no habitat loss.
                Yield rise and remain high eventually when the soil naturally reconstitute itself. This is
                because nutrients from FYM (Farm Yard Manure) are more easily retained in the soil since
                they are bound into complex organic compounds.
                c. Disadvantages
                It requires more land to produce the same quantity of food and therefore maybe harmful to
                the conservation of wildlife
                Organic waste can be a major pollutant of streams and rivers especially during storage prior
                to use, such as slummy lagoons.
                Products are more expensive than those from inorganic farming. This is because production
                is entirely labour intensive.
                Since farmers must allow sometime for soil to lose all artificial chemicals and reconstitute
                naturally, the farmer might go without income or with highly reduced yields.
                There has been an increase in weed problem as no herbicides are used. Human labour must
                remove them through weeding or mulching. This increases labour cost.
                Yield from organic farms can be lower especially within the first two years (when artificial
                fertilizers are not used) than those from conventional farms using them plus chemicals. This
                is because artificial fertilisers have a higher concentration of essential nutrient.

                Lesson
                11:
                ENERGY
                RESOURCES
                A. Definition and Classification
                A resource may be defined as any natural organic or inorganic element that can be developed or
                exploited to support man within his environment such as fish, coal, oil, gold, etc. resources can
                be classified under the following;
                1. Environmental resources: These are natural organic and inorganic resources and are of four
                types as;
                Atmospheric resources: It is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen and other minor gases such as
                carbon dioxide, helium, nitrons, hydrogen, ozone and water vapour.----
                Water resources: It includes all natural water in the earth whether in the gaseous, liquid or
                solid form. This can be subdivided into ground water (natural springs and wells) and surface
                water (lakes, stream, rivers, rain, reservoirs, seas and oceans)
                Vegetal resources: These are made-up of forest and grassland
                Mineral resources: Minerals are valuable resources found in rocks and weathered layers of
                the earth.
                Human resources: They simply include; human knowledge, skill, technology, labour and
                purchasing power (market).
                B. Sources and distribution on a global scale
                The general sources of energy are classified into traditional and modern. The traditional sources
                include firewood and charcoal. They are widely used in the LEDCs. The modern sources of
                power are coal, natural gas, petroleum, solar, HEP, tides, winds, Biogas and biotic waves.
                Importance of Energy sources
                 It provides electricity for domestic uses such as lighting of houses, cooking, ironing of
                clothes, etc.
                 Itprovides fuel and electricity for industrial uses.
                 Itis used for fueling movable objects such as cars and airplanes
                 Itencourages the growth of plants such as the green-house effects.
                 It improves the social standard of the society by promoting the usage of electrical equipment
                such as cookers, heaters, refrigerators, pressing irons.
                 Italso encourages the development of new industries with modern technology.
                C. Problems of energy resources (Non-renewable sources)
                1. Exhaustibility: The long duration taken by non-renewable minerals to form renders them to
                be termed non-renewable. Again, the high demand for these minerals which is as a result of
                the increasing world population is rendering these scarce minerals highly exhaustible in an
                attempt to meet up with the everyday demand for them. This has resulted to their depletion
                and consequent conflict between countries and tribes of the world especially in areas where
                these minerals are limited.
                2. Pollution: The extraction as well as the usage of minerals like coal, petroleum, nuclear
                energy causes high rate of pollution both on the environment and on human health. This
                generates badlands as well as complicated health issues to humans and other living
                organisms.
                D. Energy Sources for the future (Sustainable or Renewable)
                1. Hydroelectric Power (H.E.P): It is supplied from a waterfall on a river course. It is
                transmitted by cables to very distances for domestic and industrial uses. It advantages are;
                It does not produce any greenhouse gases------
                Once the dam is constructed, it provides relatively cheap electricity.
                Dams control flow of water and can be used to check flowing down streams.
                Lakes behind the dam can be used for recreation.
                Its disadvantages are;
                Dams are expensive to build and often difficult to access
                Alarge area of land may be flooded and people displaced in case of collapse of a dam
                Large sums of money are spent on resettlement schemes.
                The lakes behind the dam can slowly silt up
                2. Solar Energy: Solar is not widely used in large-scale power plants but is used in local
                installations within the consumer’s immediate proximity. Solar energy plants use a parabolic
                design placed on the roofs of houses through which the rays are absorbed and transmitted
                into electrical energy to the immediate surroundings. It has the following advantages
                It is mobile and flexible--
                It can be used to power electronic equipment
                Satellites and other space stations use solar energy to extend their effective life
                It reduces carbon monoxide emission from the use of the heating oil.
                3. Wind Energy: The wind blow onto the roter blades and as they rotate, they generate
                electricity. Electricity is transmitted through cables to the immediate surrounding for local
                consumption. Wind energy is well developed in North Britain. Its advantages are;
                --
                The electricity produced is very cheap
                It does not cause pollution
                It is easy to install wind energy.
                4. Other sources of renewable energy sources are wave/tidal, geothermal, and biomass. These
                are very limited in use today and are mostly found in the MEDCs due to high technological
                advancement.

                A. Definition
                Minerals are inorganic substances which have definite chemical composition. In order words, a
                mineral is a naturally occurring, inorganic solid that has a definite chemical composition and
                crystal structure.
                B. Types and distribution on a global scale
                Minerals are of three types as follows:
                 Minerals which can be used to provide power e.g. coal and petroleum
                 Metallic minerals which are subdivided into two groups: Non-ferrous minerals i.e. minerals
                containing metal e.g. aluminum, tin, copper, etc. and ferrous minerals i.e. minerals containing
                iron e.g. iron ore.
                 Non-metallic mineral, they include asbestors, sulphur and salt.
                Global distribution of minerals is as seen on the table below

                D. Problemsofmineralresourcesintheworldtoday
                1. Over exploitation: Minerals are over exploited faster than their regeneration capacity. This
                over exploitation is as a result of increase pressure for use of minerals by the ever growing
                world population.
                2. Destruction of vegetation: Mineral exploitation is destroying the natural vegetation. This
                tends to affect the water supply sources, especially in areas where mining activities destroy
                the forest.
                3. Increase pollution: The extraction and processing of minerals causes pollution. This has also
                threatened the earth’s natural ecosystems.
                4. Mining has caused derelict landscape due to pits and heaps of wastes that are left after
                mining. The land surface become ugly and cannot support any economic activity.
                5. Increase social problems: Sometimes, there is a social problem of strike by mining workers
                for better working conditions. This often affects output in the mining area.
                6. Increased death rates: The collapse of mines usually results to death of miners involved.
                7. Huge capital: Mining methods such as shaft or underground mining requires huge capital to
                purchase machines and to pay for human labour.
                8. Inadequate technology: Most minerals especially in the LEDCs are yet to be exploited due to
                inadequate technology.
                E. Waysof conserving mineral resources----
                Some countries conserve their minerals through the importation of minerals from other
                countries. This is the case with some advanced industrialised countries such as the USA.
                In some mining centres the quota system of exploitation is applied, that is mining companies
                are permitted to extract a certain quantity of minerals a year to avoid over exploitation
                Governments issue licences to exploiting companies. This is to limit the number of
                companies and reduce the quantity of minerals extracted at a certain period
                In some cases, high taxes are levied on exploiting companies in order to discourage new
                companies from investing in the mining sector.

                INDUSTRIES
                WHATIS
                MANUFACTURING?
                A. Meaning and classification
                The word industry has diverse meaning and its narrowest sense, industry means manufacturing
                i.e. the making of goods (products) under factory conditions. According to the United Nations, it
                is “the mechanical or chemical transformation of inorganic or organic substances into new
                products, whether the work is performed by power-driven machinery or by hand, whether it is
                done in a factory or in the worker’s house, and whether the products are sold wholesale or retail”.
                This definition is considered very wide because today the term is more restricted to modern
                industry with its sophisticated products and elaborate structures and characterized by complex
                methods, the specialization of labour and the use of machinery and inanimate power.
                In the broadest but more traditional sense, it refers to all stages and types of economic activities
                (E.A), be them primary or extractive (farming, fishing, mining and forestry), construction and
                manufacturing (secondary), tertiary (back-up services as administration, retailing and transport)
                and quaternary (high technology and information services). This definition is more common in
                economic geography hence has been adopted in this regard.
                Classification of industries
                1. Nature of work: Following this criterion industries could be classified as follows:
                a. Primary industry: They are industries involved in the extraction of raw material from
                the earth’s surface. Examples include farming, mining, fishing, and forestry.
                b. Secondary industry: Secondary industries are those that are involved in the
                transformation of raw materials into semi-finished and finished products. They are
                involved in manufacturing and construction. Examples include food processing industries
                like flour factories, brewery industries and biscuit industries.
                c. Tertiary industry: Tertiary industries are mainly involved in the rendering of services.
                Examples include the commercial services of transport, wholesaling and retailing,
                insurance services, services rendered by teachers, doctors and lawyers.
                d. Quaternary industry: They consist of personal services. This industry does not deal
                with goods but with people and requires generally higher levels of skills, expertise and
                specialization. Activities in such fields include education, research, administration and
                financial management.
                2. Classification based on economic balance and locational pull: This classification is as
                follows:
                a. Raw material oriented industries: Such industries are attracted to their sources of raw
                material because they use large amounts of raw materials especially heavy and bulky raw
                material like iron ore and timber. Examples include the sugar factory at Mbandjock and
                paper and pulp or plywood industries in Cameroon.
                b. Power oriented industries: These are industries which require large power supplies and
                as such tend to locate to towards their sources of power supply like those located in the
                coastfields in the USA and Europe.
                c. Labour oriented industries: These industries rely on a large labour force or on
                particular skills e.g. many high technology industries like those found in the Silicon
                Valley of the USA now locate in the area because of advanced education and training
                facilities.
                d. Market oriented industries: These are industries which locate near to market. Such
                industries generally locate in and around towns. the type of industries that locate near
                markets include those whose products become bulky with manufacture or the product
                becomes perishable after processing like bread which becomes more perishable than flour.
                3. Size of the industry: This criterion is based on a simple count of the number of factories
                found within each industry and an assessment of the size of each production unit.
                4. Number of employees or worker: This criterion is based on the number of workers
                employed by an industry. This criterion has its own weaknesses for instance, an industry’s
                size rarely correlates with its efficiency and gives few clues to its economic structure.
                5. Cost structure: This criterion is based on the proportion of total costs spent on each factor in
                the manufacturing process. Some industries like printing and publishing spend much on
                labour whereas others like chemical industries spend more on fixed capital like on a
                manufacturing plant.
                6. Value added index: Some scholars consider this criterion as the best because it likely
                indicates the overall benefits of the factories to their surrounding areas. the greater the gap
                between value of raw materials used and the value of finished goods, the higher will be the
                wages given in a particular industry and hence, the greater the benefits to the community.
                B. TheIndustrial (Manufacturing) System
                A system is a unit made up of a number of elements called components or characteristics linked
                and related to each other by the flows of energy and matter. The unit receives energy and
                material inputs from outside, which determine the functioning of the processes inside, and it
                equally releases outputs. The inputs and outputs operate at the same time so that the
                characteristics and components of the system depend on the balance between these two opposing
                group of forces. Industry is an example of an open system with parts or components, inputs,
                processes and outputs. Industry or factory as a unit has inputs, structures in which inputs are
                transformed via processes to produce output or products. This system is as seen below:

                INDUSTRIES
                INDUSTRIAL
                LOCATION
                A. Theeconomic (Optimum) location of industries
                Generally, the process of industrial manufacturing involves basically three steps (bringing
                together of the raw materials, processing them in to semi-finished or finished goods, and
                delivering the finished goods to the consumers or retail shops). The final decision as to where to
                locate the industry will usually depend on keeping the combined cost of these 3 steps as low as
                possible. That is the industry would be located on sites which are convenient and economical.
                This then brings in the concept of optimum location in the siting of industries.
                Since many elements condition the manufacturing of goods, in choosing a location, not only one
                factor is considered rather the industrialist considers the links of his firm with the wider
                economy i.e. land, labour, movement of input and output. Thus no specific location exist for
                industries. Despite this, the final location chosen should be as economical or optimal as possible
                i.e. it should meet the needs of the firm. The optimal point chosen by one firm need not to
                coincide with that of another. This is because the perceived advantages by one firm might be
                viewed as disadvantages by another. Despite the difficulties encountered in the siting of
                industries, industrialist are unified in their quest for a MINIMAX Location (these are locations
                where production costs are minimal i.e. least cost or revenue i.e. returns maximal or highest
                revenue). Industrialist therefore seeks for an Optimum Location for their industrial plants (i.e.
                these are points of highest profits). They are otherwise called Economic or Rational Locations.
                They occur at these MINIMAX locations– Maximum Revenue and Least Cost locations. Here,
                the maximum location therefore summarises the economic intention of entrepreneur–maximum
                profit or minimum cost.
                Approaches to Industrial Location
                The question of siting an industry is a delicate one because even though entrepreneurs take
                decisions to the best of their knowledge, the decisions may be inappropriate at the site. In
                consequence the industry declines and goes bankrupt. On the other hand, others may grow in
                stature within their regions, thereby confirming the superior wisdom of the entrepreneur. The
                following approaches are used:
                a. The Regional Approach: This is interested in establishing why certain locations (areas) are
                generally attractive to industrialization than others. This investigates into the reasons
                (advantages) underlying the localization or concentration of industries and the growth of
                industrial zones, regions, belts and districts. They are both at the local, national and
                international scales. These advantages are of two types i.e. natural advantages (these include
                the presence of suitable sites favourable climate, easy access to sources of power and raw
                materials, and nearness to large market) and acquired advantages (these include good
                transport facilities, commercial services, skilled labour, market organization and
                development of subsidiary services).
                b. The Industrial Approach: This investigates into the decisions taken by individuals when
                siting single firms of an industry. Thus it examines the reasons underlying the attraction of
                firms of an industry to particular locations. That is the distribution of particular industries. It
                considers the particular needs of industries and why those of one industry differ from those
                of another.
                B. Case Studies of Industrial Location (Types of Industrial Location Points)
                All industries must be located some where between the raw material source and the market.
                Many industrial location strategies have been developed and have given rise to six major
                possible MINIMAX locations. The particular nature of these locational types varies depending
                on the actual characteristics of factors considered. The final site chosen takes one of these major
                forms
                1. Foot– Loose Industries: This type is limited to industries that can be located anywhere
                between the raw material source and the market. These don not concern location decisions
                very much. These industries are tied to no traditional factors of industrial location and as
                such are not attached to any specific location type. They are also called sunrise industries.
                Examples include light engineering and other types of high-tech and quaternary industries.
                Many of these examples are found in the M4 corridor in Britain and the Silicon Glen
                (Scotland). The changing nature of manufacturing nowadays has caused a significant rise in
                this type of industrial location the world over.

                2. Raw Material Oriented: This is location near or at the source of R.M. This occurs when
                industries use large amounts of heavier and or bulkier raw material which undergo much loss
                of weight in the transformation process. These are called R.M oriented or Weight loss
                industries. Best examples are the chemical heavy manufacturing, iron steel in Pittsburgh and
                the Damodar Basin in India and primary industries. Others are oil refineries and
                petrochemical plants and fertilizer production from sea water. With the changing nature of
                manufacturing, this location is fast on the decline and those that still exist are as a result of
                inertia.

                3. Market Oriented: This is location near or in markets. This occurs when finished products
                derived from raw materials are heavier and bulkier than the R.M. The best examples are
                textile and quaternary industries, industries whose products need direct contact with the
                consumer (hair dressing, shoe and electronic repairs, shaving), food processing, cosmetics,
                industries adding water to their final products, fragile and perishable products (newspapers
                and fast foods and others from bakeries). This category of location is also becoming very
                popular.

                4. Power oriented: This is location near the power source. It occurs when an industry needs
                great quantities of power and use power as a specialized R.M. The best examples are
                aluminium smelting plants, paper manufacturing plants as ALUCAM and CELLUCAM I
                Cameroon which were sited at Edea where HEP is produced.

                abundant supply of cheap labour. This is the case of industries using much labour and/or
                specialized labour in the manufacturing process. Prominent examples are the high technology
                industries which locate in areas of higher education to obtain skilled labour e.g. near Harvard
                in USA; in Britain near Oxford and Cambridge. Also included are agro-industries and car
                manufacturing needing a large labour force.

                6. Neutral Location: This occurs where an industry uses more than one raw material. The
                location decision is more difficult and usually takes a neutral point between the two raw
                materials. With the increasing decline of traditional factors of industrial location and the
                growing international nature of manufacturing, industrial locations are becoming more and
                more neutral in nature. This is why most industrial locations are springing up but along the
                coasts.

                OF
                INDUSTRIAL
                LOCATION
                A. Physical Factors
                M
                1. Climate: People tend to work only where living conditions are congenial or where there is a
                pleasant or moderate climate. For example, the sunny conditions of California certainly
                encouraged the development of the film industry at Hollywood as well as the computer
                industries in the Silicon Valley.
                2. Available vast land: Vast land required for the installation of an industry. This explains why
                some industries are much often located in the outskirts of some towns. vast empty land is
                usually found at the periphery of many towns. industries require sufficient spaces and flat
                surfaces which are cheap and where waste disposal is easy. Flat land also reduces the cost of
                building and gives room for future expansion.
                3. Raw material: Some industries are called raw material oriented industries because they are
                located near to raw material. These industries include those using raw materials which are
                heavy, bulky and perishable. In such cases, the industry will tend to locate closer to sources
                of the raw material in order to minimize transportation costs involved in carrying useless
                waste materials or waste products that is eliminated during processing.
                4. Power supply/Energy Resources: Some industries are power oriented. Early industries
                tended to be located near to sources of power, which in the past could not be moved. These
                industries based on coal or oil intended to be tied to coalfields and oil fields due to their
                bulkiness and immobility.
                5. Water supply: Industries that used large quantities of water, either for cooling purposes and
                washing of machine and machine parts and for processing like brewing were and are still
                often located along side fast flowing rivers or where water is available like around wells if
                fresh water is needed or at the cost if salt water is needed.
                B. Humanfactors (Economic factors)
                6. Capital: Both fixed capital like buildings, machinery and financial capital are important in
                the location of an industry. The cost of acquiring capital varies from place to place. Industries
                are often located where capital is available and where it is easier to acquire it. This explains
                why industrial centers are found where capital for investment is available like from banks.
                7. Labour: The cost, availability, quantity and quality of labour affect the location of industries.
                Labour intensive industries for instance, will tend to be located where there are vast
                quantities of unskilled and cheap labour. Automated or special firms will be attracted to areas
                where there is skilled or versatile labour.
                8. Transport: The availability of roads, railways, water ways and ports are important in the
                location of industries. Places with efficient transport routes attract more industries than those
                where such facilities are lacking. This explains why some firms tend to locate along roads,
                canals, around harbors, railway stations and airports.
                9. Market: Some industries are market oriented. They tend to be located near the market.
                Industries will locate near the market if their products become more bulky and costly to
                transport such as refrigerators, cookers and furniture, perishable after processing like bread
                which is more perishable than flour, fragile like glasses, fashionable like dresses, have short
                life cycles like newspapers are prestigious.
                10. Influence of human choice: This is also an important consideration because an industry
                does not just grow but develops as a result of human decisions. It therefore goes that other
                considerations exists that man can use to site a firm, which are neither physical nor economic.
                Thus, some industries are located where they are simply by chance. These chance locations
                can be as a result of the accident of history, patriotism and personal likeness of the site by the
                owner.

                GOVERNMENT
                POLICY
                AND
                INDUSTRIAL
                LOCATION
                In many places today government controls the location of industries and sometimes the location
                of industries in an area has to consider national interest be it in a socialist, communist or
                capitalist government. Sometimes industries might not locate at the optimum sites because they
                are persuaded or forced to locate in particular areas for various social, economic, strategic and
                political reasons. This is done by the government in the following ways:
                1. Taxation policy: The aim of the tax policy may be to encourage or discourage the location of
                industries in an area. Heavy taxes may be imposed on industries in areas where the
                government wants to discourage the location of industries may be to preserve the area for
                other land use like residential. On the other hand, the government may want to encourage the
                location of industries in some areas like lagging or depressed areas. This may be done
                through tax reduction.
                2. Direct government encouragement through financial assistance (subsidies): Financial
                assistance such as subsidies, grants, loans and tax concessions may be granted to some
                industries to encourage their location in some specific places like in remote or depressed
                areas.
                3. Special concessions: Special concessions could be granted to industries to locate in some
                areas such as low interest rates on bank loans, subsidies and grants as well as the provision of
                cheap land.
                4. Provision of social services and amenities: Government can influence industrial location
                through government expenditure on infrastructural improvement or development of social
                services and amenities in depressed areas. the government may provide such services like
                water supplies, communication networks, power supply, sewage schemes and building of
                houses for workers (camps) and the construction of training or education centres for workers
                or their families.
                5. Government could conduct research and provide information to the industrialists on the
                location and sites available with advantages each industrial type is likely to derive. This is
                done with the aim of attracting industries in depressed areas.
                6. Decentralization policy: Sometimes industries may be decentralized from places like inner
                cities towards depressed regions or towards the outskirts to avoid inner city problems like
                overcrowding, limited space, pollution, congestion and poor and limited social services and
                amenities like lodging facilities.
                7. Laws or legislations: In some places laws or legislations relating to hours of work, minimum
                wages, land use patterns, decentralization and agglomeration may be passed to influence
                industrialization. For example, land use zoning policies can prevent industries moving into
                reserved areas, residential areas and regions of beautiful countryside like National Parks or
                green belts.
                WhyGovernment influence the location of industries
                a. Economic reasons: Most governments aim to encourage the economic advancement of
                depressed areas such as depressed rural areas, declining industrial regions and inner cities.
                The reasons for developing such lagging regions include redressing regional imbalance as a
                high concentration creates employment opportunities. Again some industrial regions tend to
                have more than a fair share of industries resulting in pollution, congestion and housing
                problems.
                b. Social r reasons: Government intervention in the location of industries inorder to improve
                the standard of living of the people and to avoid social unrest that may result from
                differences in wealth between the different regions of the country. Sometimes the aim of the
                government may be to improve social welfare, happiness and social stability of the
                populations as decentralizing industries from inner cities helps to reduce pollution,
                overcrowding and congestion.
                c. Political reasons: The government may intervene in industrial location as a means of
                placating nationalistic feelings within some regions. Governments are keen to reduce
                unemployment in order to gain political support.
                d. Strategic reasons: The relocation of key industries into remote areas for example,
                safeguards them from attack in an event of war. Government strategic interventions are
                usually to protect key industries by location them in safe regions. Example the air craft
                industry of USA is relocated far away from the USA Eastern seaboard.
                e. Planning reasons (desire to control land use): Many governments intervene in industrial
                location in order to control land use and as a general planning policy aimed at regional
                wealth equalization. Land use zoning policies prevent industries moving into residential areas
                or into reserved land such as National parks and Green belts.

                A. Meaning
                CHANGING
                NATURE
                OF
                INDUSTRIAL
                LOCATION
                Industrialization is so dynamic a phenomenon that most of its tenets constantly change overtime.
                As a result the location changes in response to the changing industrial environment. The factos of
                industrial location have over the years since the industrial revolution and especially since the
                second half of the 20th century experienced significant change. Almost everywhere the most
                significant locational change has been from traditional manufacturing regions predominantly on
                coalfields, to higher quality of life regions offering the hard and soft infrastructural requirements
                of modern industry. In the UK, for example within their standard economic regions where
                manufacturing has historically concentrated in and around the largest urban agglomerations,
                recent decades have seen significant shifts of industry towards “Greenfield” rural locations. So
                great has been the movement, that it is heralded as the most dramatic locational change in the
                MEDCsand the later part of the 20th century.
                B. Typical Examples
                The examination of selected industries from the primary, secondary and modern secondary
                (quaternary) manufacturing activities reveal that their locations have drifted from the sites of
                physical advantages (considered in the nineteenth century) towards points of human and
                economic advantages (which are more significant today). Under this category, the iron and steel
                particularly in UK is a secondary industry initially tied to raw materials and sources of energy
                but in which economic and physical factors have become increasingly more important.
                C. Factors and implications
                a. Exhaustion of raw material: Raw materials are mostly exhaustible and once depleted,
                industries must move to new source of raw materials especially if the raw materials lose
                much weight and bulk during manufacturing. This is the case of industries in Britain,
                Germany and USA located around iron ore and coal supplies.
                b. The use of new sources of power or energy: Industries changing their power source from
                coal to petroleum or HEP will need to relocate near these new sources if other reasons as
                markets are guaranteed e.g. since the industrial revolution, industries have moved from upper
                reaches of river valleys, coalfields and oilfields and pipe line terminals. This is due to
                changing power requirements and types used.
                c. Adoption of new invention (technology): This leads to expansion of industry and therefore
                need more space on flat cheap land. In consequence, some industries have moved from the
                heart of cities to suburbs (leap fogging) or moved to relocate around new markets. For
                example, the metal box company in Britain in the advent of new plastic technology moved
                from North Wales to meet up markets of soft drinks companies in the Midlands, north-west
                England and Scotland.
                d. Development of transport facilities: This may open up new areas hitherto considered as
                unsuitable areas and make them attractive. This is the case with the opening of the south west
                of USA, south France and south Germany hitherto considered strictly agricultural. The
                development of transport also might make it a cheaper factor and less advantageous than
                other factors.
                e. Change in living standards: A rise in living standards reduces the importance of industries
                producing necessities. Since luxuries have different locational demands, this tendency could
                have far reaching consequences as to cause industries to relocate. The rise in living standards
                partly accounts for the relocation of industries into and/or around large cities.
                f.
                Force of agglomeration: When industries cluster, numerous disadvantages (high rates and
                rents, high wages, power unions, scarcity of land for waste disposal and expansion) se t in.
                industries tend to move away from such industrial clusters.
                g. The entrepreneur may change for strategic reasons: This is if he considers the current
                location vulnerable to competition. The change in the location of Grundig from Germany to
                Northern Ireland and then to the Philippines was to avoid keen competition from other
                producers.

                INDUSTRIAL
                AGGLOMERATIONS
                A. Meaning
                Industrial agglomeration is the clustering, concentration, grouping, crowding or location of
                several industries in a given area or region. It is therefore the clustering together and association
                of activities in close proximity to each other. It is also called the localization of industries. In an
                agglomeration, all types of industries may be found side by side and the firms and industries
                existing in an agglomeration often have strong functional linkages binding them together.
                Models on Agglomeration
                1. The Concentration Theory: This was formulated by J.H Thompson to identify a hierarchy
                of concentration of industries. The members of the hierarchy are classified according to the
                amount or density of manufacturing that takes place and also in terms of functions and
                linkages. Within this, each level of industrial development is linked to the next in a manner
                that for every two units there is one at the next stage up. These arithmetic hierarchies produce
                spatial webs as on the following figure:
                Industrial belt
                Industrial zone
                Urban system
                Central place
                Industrial district
                Individual plant
                Figure: A Hierarchy of Industrial Concentration after Thompson
                From the diagram above, it is seen that the basic unit (smallest) is the individual plant or factory.
                When they concentrate in an area such as an industrial estate, the result is an industrial district.
                Two or more industrial districts form a central place as a manufacturing town (Douala, Yaounde,
                Garoua in Cameroon). Two or more central places form an urban system or conurbation e.g.
                Portsmouth-Southampton. Two or more urban systems forms and industrial zone e.g. Lancashire.
                At the top of the hierarchy is the Industrial belt as North Western Europe, the Great Lakes
                Region of North America. Thus the web of industrial centres has a diminishing relationship.
                Thompson carried further his idea of concentration and suggested an agglomeration theory. This
                takes account of the fact that the amount of manufacturing in conurbations increases as a country
                develops economically. He holds that the very large urban systems are getting very much larger
                in advanced economies.
                Measuring the Strength of Industrial Agglomeration
                Location Quotient
                This is the quantitative or statistical method used to show or measure the degree of concentration
                of a specific industry within a particular area compared to its overall distribution in the whole are
                on both local and national scale. It is therefore a measure of the relative concentration of an
                industry in a particular area. It takes two forms as follows:
                a. The Specialisation Index: It is used to measure the degree of specialization of an industry
                through the following formulas
                Formula 1:
                OR
                Formula 2:
                Where P1 is percentage of people employed in industry 1, P2 in industry 2 etc.
                Note: The lower the index the more diversified is the industrial structure of the area.
                b. TheConcentration Index
                Formula3:
                Note: Location quotient has no units.
                Analysis of the Index
                 TheNational Average always has a L.Q of 100% (or index equal to 1). This signifies that the
                area has the same representation of industries as the national average. Thus we should expect
                all areas to have roughly the same proportion of workers in services as gas, electricity and
                refuse collection. It also shows that it has a fair share or average share of industry. This value
                also indicates that the area is simply self-sufficient in this industry.
                 Anindex of more than 100 % (or greater than 1). This signifies that the area has an above
                average representation or concentration of that particular industry. Thus, the area has more
                than it’s fair or average share of this type of industry. Also, it shows that the area is over
                populated in this category of industry. That is, the industry is over represented in this region.
                 An index of less than 100% (or index less than 1) indicates that the industry is under
                represented or less-developed in the area than the nation as a whole. Thus, the area is
                deficient or has a less than its fair share of this form of industry.
                Significance or Importance of Location Quotient
                It indicates if more agglomeration or deglomeration is in process
                It helps in evaluating the strength, importance or degree of concentration of industries in a
                region----
                It indicates whether a region is advancing or declining, lagging, depressing or expanding or
                growing by use of regional share trend
                It helps show the main or key industries of a region’s economic development
                It helps in the identification of those regions that are advanced or backward
                It provides information on the distribution of industries in both quantity and quality
                It helps regional planning since it provides the government with information about the
                regions which industrialisation should be encouraged or discouraged.
                Weaknesses of Location Quotient----
                It uses only employment figures which is inadequate. This is because a few giant can employ
                great numbers while many small firms employ same or less. Here, they are same in index but
                in numbers of industries they are not the same. So it is not wholly a good index.
                So it does not talk of absolute numbers of industrial plants
                It does not consider area sizes of the different regions. This is because a few industries (10) in
                a small area might appear concentrated, meanwhile many (100) in a large area appear
                sparsely distributed.
                The quality of workers is not mentioned.
                Other aspects of industries as turnover, output, working conditions, pollution, etc, are
                neglected.
                B. Mainglobal industrial zones and industrial groups (Summarise it)
                The spatial distribution of manufacturing especially large-scale heavy industry is not uniform in
                the world. This has generally been attached to temperate latitudes, coalfields, port facilities and
                regions of European settlements in the LEDCs.
                 Factory based industrialization started in Britain in the 18th century because of population
                growth, agricultural improvements, and increasing trade with her empire, technical
                inventions and a large-scale base of coal. Towns and industries grew around coalfields in
                Britain and the phenomenon then spread across Europe and later on to the USA. Recently, it
                has taken root in Russia, Japan and many parts of the LEDCs. In these cases, the existence of
                coalfields or cheap and easy access to them was the sole factor.
                 Inrecent times the development of new power sources that are transmitted easily, and the rise
                of the varied types of light industries, have created new industrial regions. This location now
                shows increasing importance of capital cities and metropolis of the world. thus cities within
                urban regions as London, Paris, New York, Moscow, Sydney, Tokyo, Buenos Aires and Sao
                Paolo have developed a high concentration of industries. In developing countries,
                manufacturing is rising out of hitherto primary production. At times industry is based on
                imported raw materials, fuel and most often technology. This is partly due to the cut off in
                the flow of finished products from USA and Europe especially during the Second World War.
                Also as a result of economically backward countries see industrial growth as a means of
                making themselves more self-sufficient and politically more independent.
                The most noticeable aspect of the industrial landscape is the great unevenness in the
                distribution of significant industrial regions. It is thus an observable fact that there are parts
                of the world with more industries than other, and there are some areas where industries are so
                concentrated that they may be classified as industrial regions.
                NB: The “Power Belt” from the Mississippi to the Ural Mountains accounts for about 80% of the
                world’s total value of manufactured output and about 90% of the world’s total energy
                consumption. The five main centres of industrial development are therefore; the Northern
                Eastern USA, Europe, the Western USSR, Northern India and Eastern Asia. Although there are
                minor agglomerations outside these areas (Coast of West Africa, South Africa, Eastern Coast of
                Brazil and Mexico), there are still large areas devoid of any industry. From this it is clear that
                most industrial development is located in the middle latitude and is closely associated with the
                coalfields and areas of European settlement. The tropical belt is characterized by an almost total
                absence of industries.
                C. Factors/Reasons for Industrial Agglomeration
                1. Abundant resources: The area that has the coincidence of rivers, favourable climate, raw
                materials and power sources, offers a great relative advantage to a variety of firms and they
                cluster to take advantage of these. For example, early industrial development in South Wales
                is linked to this as there was an extensive coalfield, iron and tin resources. Thus, major iron
                works, tin plates, copper, tin, nickel and zinc smelting grew. This is also the case of
                Pittsburgh industrial region in USA, the Douala industrial region on the coast of Cameroon,
                which lies within the field of numerous agro-based resources.
                2. Vast land: Industrial concerns require suitable land (flat) for location. Areas with vast level
                land are attractive to diverse industrial concerns. Diverse industries thus concentrate in such
                areas thereby establishing industrial agglomerations. This explains why industrial
                agglomerations are located more around coastal low lands. For example, coastal low lands of
                Cameroon, South Wales, North East USA.
                3. Great relative advantage of an area: This point is slightly different from the idea of
                abundant resources for it is the aspect of location. Areas which areas easily accessible attract
                diverse industries. This is because raw materials can easily be imported and also finished
                products exported. Thus, the area gives the advantage of reaching both the market of raw
                materials and finished products.
                4. Diverse transport modes: Where transport networks pass, development of all sorts follows.
                In consequence, areas with numerous well developed transport systems/water (ocean and
                inland), roads, rail, air, attract all types of industrial concerns. This is the case of the Rand in
                South Africa, the new growth of Sao Paolo in Brazil, the Damodar valley in India, the Rhur
                in Germany, South Wales in Britain, etc,.
                5. Large markets: The cardinal objective of industrial production is to ensure adequate
                disposal of the final product. Thus, industries strive to guarantee an effective market for their
                products. Thus, areas of large populations tend to have industrial agglomerations. Whether it
                is the industries that attract people or the people that pull the industries, is still subject to
                evaluation.
                6. Large pool of labour supply: Areas with large supply of labour, which in character, pull
                numerous industrial concerns. This is why large urban agglomerations are seats of industrial
                agglomerations. Adequate quantities of unskilled, semi-skilled, skilled and specialized labour
                that meet the needs of varied industries can be obtained in them.
                7. History: This is quite visible in areas of industrial development. The setting up of an industry,
                establishes a multiplier effect (Gunnar Myrdal) which attracts other industries. The clustering
                of industries around old industrial regions as Rhur in Germany, South Wales in Britain,
                North East USA, among others is a clear testimony of the magnetic pull exerted by old
                industrial regions on new industries.
                8. Functional linkages: Industries functionally linked tend to locate nearer each other. this is to
                facilitate their operations as the delivery of component parts.
                9. Government policy: Policies favourable to development of industries, lead to concentration
                of industries. These include; the creation of industrial free zones, villages or counties; the
                granting of subsidies and tax holidays to industries locating in such areas. this is the main
                reason behind industrial agglomerations in the developing countries and new growth
                industrial regions in the developed world e.g. South and West USA, Southern France and
                Italy.
                D. Advantages and Disadvantages
                Advantages
                a. Skilled labour pool: Once industries concentrate all type of labour flow in and the problem
                of labour supply becomes negligible. Also, trained jobless people often migrate into such
                areas to look for employment. Numerous part-time and seasonal job seekers stream into the
                area.
                b. Development of local research and educational facilities: These expand so as to ensure the
                training of labour, and thus, create a pool of high skill labour industries. The clustered
                industries can jointly train a pool of required specialized labour, and create local research and
                educational facilities. This increases the productivity and efficiency of labour and the firms.
                c. Advantage of local services: In the areas, many subsidiary services (supporting the
                industries as banking, insurance) as local financial services and expertise which understands
                local requirements, ancillaries (producing parts of the main products) and local cleaning and
                maintenance are abundant. As these services are readily available they are also cheap. There
                is the development of a specialist quarter where valuable links with other firms can be
                established.
                d. Stronger bargain with labour unions: The industries can jointly negotiate and defend their
                interest in other areas when need arises. In Cameroon, the GICAM (Groupe Industrielle du
                Cameroun) negotiates for the industries with labour trade unions and the government.
                e. Transport, management and capital facilities: Such areas have well developed transport
                networks, a great pool of skilled managers and numerous fixed and money capital facilities.
                As industries locating here benefit from them the administration of firms becomes easy
                especially as they are found together.
                f.
                Large markets: Industrial agglomerations are often concentrations of people. This fact in
                addition with the norm that numerous industries serve as a large market for the products of
                industries, makes industrial agglomerations to be the sites of profitable markets. In the area a
                local trade develops.
                g. Joint ventures: Industries can come together and develop facilities such as power resources
                (HEP, Thermal plant), develop inland water ways (canals and canalized rivers). These make
                industries to obtain power supplies cheaply.
                h. Efficiency of production: The concentration of industries, leads to the development of
                linkages that permits specialization. Since in the agglomerations several industries produce
                the same product competition is fostered. All these generate higher efficiency in production.
                Disadvantages
                a. Rise in factor prices: As a result of high competition and demand, labour wages, land rents
                and interest on capital rise rapidly. This therefore raises the cost of production and
                establishes negative effect on profits.
                b. Labour unions become stronger and more influential: If the large pool of labour co
                ordinates its activities, it becomes a tremendous force to reckon with because labour strikes
                can become more effective. Thus, they can extort better working conditions which reduce
                labour productivity and causes production cost to rise. The result is a rise in price with the
                consequent fall in demand causing revenue of manufacturers to fall.
                c. Congestion and overcrowding: The constant shipment of raw materials into and finished
                goods from the area leads to congestion on transport networks. This leads to slow-ups which
                affects industrial productivity and efficiency. This is worsened by the large number of people
                swarming the area in search of jobs and the employed who use the same media daily to and
                from work.
                d. Limited land: The concentration of industries makes suitable land for expansion scarce and
                where it exists, it is very expensive to obtain. For industries to expand they have forced to
                stretch into marginal land as marshes and valleys. This is the case of Bonaberi industrial zone
                in Douala-Cameroon, where scarcity of land has coerced it to expand along marshes around
                Bekoko.
                e. Pollution: Environmental pollution (air, water, land and sound), results through solid, liquid
                and gaseous waste, and noise production. This comes from chimneys, remains of raw
                materials, cooling and cleaning of production units. With environmental production being a
                world concern, the fight against pollution constitutes a big drain on the resources of
                industries as it entails a diversion of resources from profitable ventures.
                f.
                Problems of waste disposal: It is serious in regions of agglomerations of industries and
                worse in cases of solid waste because vast land for dumping is scarce. The handling of
                industrial and household waste becomes very expensive and dangerous, especially when the
                waste is toxic. It is due to this that MEDCs send lots of toxic waste to the coast of LEDCs
                looking for dumping grounds.
                g. High taxes: Since the agglomerations pull a great percentage of a country’s or region’s
                resources (both natural and human), they must contribute more also. Thus, the government
                demands more through higher taxes.
                E. Whyfewmanufacturing industries in developing world
                1. Shortage of capital: This is partly due to domination by the primary sector with its low
                income fetching products. Also the low incomes and low propensity to save which reduce
                investment levels, poor structuring of financial orgainsation and some no-existent.
                Embezzlement of huge internal capital has led to capital flight. This has led to reliance on
                foreign capital, which is not a sure base of industrialization as most proceeds are carried out,
                and foreign aid often comes with great strings.
                2. Inadequate knowledge on profitable lines of production: This fear has killed prospective
                investors because research establishments and organization firms which exist in MEDCs to
                offer information on the investment climate do not exist.
                3. Inadequate supply of skilled labour and expertise: Even if capital is available, suitable
                personnel that is a precondition for industrial take-off is scarce. This is because amn power
                training is limited and poorly oriented.
                4. Limited base for industrialization: Everywhere in the world, the precondition for take of
                manufacturing industries has been the existence of a sound iron nand steel base and better
                still if they coincided with coal seams. Unfortunately, this prerequisite for sustainable take
                off of manufacturing is scanty in existence and where iron and steel industries are present
                they are either weakly established or is almost white elephants (as the case of Nigeria).
                5. Small markets: The low incomes, low living standards and demand have limited the market
                size for products of manufacturing activities. since demand for manufacturing goods is very
                small to support any large scale industrialization, most LEDCs rely on imports from MEDCs
                to satisfy the limited local demand. This has been a great disincentive to investment ventures
                in this sector.
                6. Poor transport and communication networks: Transport systems as water, road and rail
                which support industrialization are either poorly developed or not developed at all. This
                renders difficult the movement of inputs into factories and finished products to the market.
                Furthermore, modern communication facilities as internet, telex, telephone are poorly
                developed and unreliable. All these reinforce the unattractiveness of the region to investors.
                7. Unfavourable government policy: There are high taxes on profit and also the existence of
                limited or no industrial free zones. Also administrative bottlenecks are many and have
                discouraged investment. This unhealthy investment atmosphere is made worse by the high
                levels of corruption which has contributed significantly to kill initiative. All these have
                discouraged foreign investment and maintained high unemployment levels.
                8. Political instability: The LEDCs are characterized by unstable governments, recurrent
                strikes and civil wars. These have made installations vulnerable, misdirected funds, attention
                and investments ventures. These discourage foreign capital investment since guarantee and
                security are not assured their investment.

                19:
                FUNCTIONAL
                A. Meaning and Types
                LINKAGES
                AND
                CHANGES
                These are the numerous operational chains, contacts, connections or relationships existing
                between separate industrial firms. These are contacts and flows of information and materials
                between firms which can occur more easily and cheaply where the firms are in close proximity.
                These can be with other industries and also the general public and result from the close proximity
                of firms. It is for this reason that they are called geographical association of firms.
                These linkages are because no firm can be self-sufficient or entirely independent except those
                who use one or more raw materials to produce finished foods for consumption, for example food
                processing industries as flour milling, meat packing.
                Types of functional linkages
                a. Vertical or Simple Chain Linkage: This is the simplest linkage. This occurs when the
                interrelationships are in such a way that the product passes through a series of stages
                (processes) with each process being at a different level or stage of production. In this type,
                the product leaves each stage with an added value. Examples include the garment industry
                (i.e. cotton-spinning-weaving-cloth-garment), the paper industry, non-ferrous metal trade.
                This can be vertical backward to guarantee a raw material source or vertical forward to
                secure a market outlet. That main advantage here is that as the plants are together economies
                of scale are enjoyed and the main disadvantage is that a fall in demand of the final products
                will affect all the other industries or firms and even linked to some of the industries laterally
                and diagonally which may lead to mass unemployment.
                b. Horizontal (lateral or multi-origin) linkages: This is when an industry relies on several
                other industries to provide its industrial component parts and accessories which are
                assembled at some later stage. In this case, the final product is the result of an assembling
                process of components coming from different industries at the same stage of production into
                a final product that goes into the market e.g. motor car spare parts into a car. This industry is
                at the final stage of production.

                c. Diagonal (multi-destination) Linkages: This is when an industry makes a component that
                can be used subsequently in several industries. That is it entails the making of a product or
                providing a service that is required at various stages in the vertical production process. Thus
                there is the diversification of markets so as to raise security. This is the situation of risk
                bearing economies. The contacts of the firma are with a number of separate plants and do not
                strictly form a link in a given chain of processes in the same way as the horizontally or
                vertically related firms.

                d. Technological Linkages: This is the case where a product from one industry is used
                subsequently as a raw material by several other industries.

                1. Differences in level of technology: Some industries are more technologically developed
                than others and the more technologically advanced the industry, the greater and stronger the
                linkages and vice versa. For example, it is stronger in the motor car assembly than a block
                molding concern. Thus linkages are bound to exist.
                2. Differences in complexity: Some involve movement of single product or service from one
                factory to another (simple), while others involve large number of input and outputs between
                numerous factories.
                3. They vary in scale: Some are small in scale as between one workshop and another, while
                others are large between major industries.
                4. Vary in strength: Strong linkages are those which are considered important or essential to
                the firm. A good example is the linkage between the rubber and tyre industries. On the other
                hand, weak linkages are those not essential to the firm e.g. can be the linkage between the
                motor car industry and stationary plant.
                5. They vary with distance: The short distance linkages are those within the same locality or
                even on the same street. Those of enormous distance are as far as between continents. The
                best example is the motor car industry where linkages are becoming more international.
                6. Vary according to the size of the plant: Larger firms have more numerous complex
                linkages with associated activities. This is the reverse for smaller plants.
                7. They vary according to level of industrial development: The more advanced the level of
                development, there are more numerous and complicated linkages in the MEDCs. On the
                other hand, in backward industrial societies, the linkages are simple and few, since industries
                are few and most industries do not go beyond the first stage of processing.
                C. Significance of Industrial Linkages
                 Energysavings: This is because the energy given off by one process can be used elsewhere
                 Reducedtransport cost: This is because of reduced move to obtain services
                 Waste from one industry can form raw material in another. This therefore increases revenue
                of the waste producing company. For example, coal tar from iron smelting industry os used
                as raw material in the road construction company.
                 There is great interdependence: This is as a result of specialization and enables firms to adopt
                specialized techniques and machinery. This brings in greater efficiency and improved quality
                due to increased competition.
                 Theworkers acquire higher levels of skill and further research, due to specialization.
                 There is improvement in communication services and financial investments. This is due to
                joint ventures undertaken by the firms.
                 There is benefit of economies of scale especially where several firms buy in bulk or share
                distribution cost.
                 Joint solution to problems. This is because as they are in the same geographical location, they
                meet with less inconvenience to discuss common problems and matters of mutual benefits.
                 Vertical linkages ensure a guarantee of secured supply of raw materials (backward) and
                markets for finished products (forward).

                20:
                INDUSTRIAL
                INERTIA
                A. Meaning and examples
                Inertia literally means a state of continued existence, a lack of movement, passivity in the face of
                change and resistance. Thus, for a better understanding, it is the tendency for an industry to
                remain at its original location or site, even though the factors which attracted it there are no
                longer relevant or existing. It is also the tendency of some industries continuing to survive in an
                area where the cost-benefits they once enjoyed no longer exist. A clear example is the Don
                valley (South Yorkshire) in Britain. The original iron industry was based on charcoal supplies for
                power and local iron deposits. Even though modern fuels (cooking coal, oil, natural gas and HEP)
                have developed and scrap iron imported, the industry remained. This has made Sheffield to
                remain as an important steel town and Doncaster remains an important iron and steel town.
                Another example is the Woollen textile industries of West Yorkshire and cotton textile industry
                of Lancashire.
                B. Reasons and Implications of Industrial Inertia
                1. Capital equipment is fixed, immobile, expensive, flexible and so the tendency is for firms
                which had long established to remain in fixed areas. once land has been acquired, a factory
                built and machinery installed it becomes difficult for an industry to abandon its original site.
                2. High cost of relocation: The cost of relocation can be expensive and far out weight any
                financial savings made at a new site. It is often cheaper to expand industrial capacity at any
                existing site than to construct a new plant on a new site. Abandoning the old site will entail
                dismantling or destroying some old structures and machines to transport them to a new site,
                which can be very difficult and expensive.
                3. Economies of scale and industrial linkages: An industrialist will prefer to maintain his or
                her industry at an initial site because of the advantages or benefits of agglomeration and
                linkages the industry has with other ones in the area. Such advantages, which may be
                attracting the industry at its old site include the availability of cheap labour, social services
                and amenities, transport or communication network, the presence of financial institutions,
                etc,. These benefits of agglomeration can exert a magnetic force of which a firm may find it
                both difficult and expensive to break away.
                4. High cost of building and equipping a new factory or industry: An industry may find it
                difficult to relocate because building and equipping a new factory or industry is expensive.
                The existing site continues to be maintained. An industry that fails to move from one area to
                another when its original locational advantages change will also benefit labour and
                transportation advantages and sometimes a local market in the form of other factories which
                use its finished goods.
                5. Government policy: Government industrial policy may restore or maintain an industry at its
                initial site despite its locational disadvantage in order to avoid the industrial region from
                continuous decline. Government may also want to avoid heavy and continuous
                unemployment in depressed areas with persistent unemployment, low incomes, inadequate
                social services and limited potentials for industrialization.
                6. Uncertainty and poor knowledge of some profitable sites: An industrialist may decide to
                maintain his industrial firm at a site where the original factors that favoured the location of
                the industry have disappeared because of uncertain market conditions which exist elsewhere.
                The business person may have limited or imperfect knowledge of the existing market
                conditions or the advantages of the site.
                7. Body of skilled labour: Bodies of skilled labour, which already exist at the old site and
                which may not be found at the new site prevent the industry from relocation. The labour
                force may not easily or cheaply be obtained elsewhere.
                8. The availability of communication infrastructure at the old site: Transport networks as
                roads, railways, airports, canals and seaports as well as telecommunication facilities as
                telephones, telex and telefax that already exist in the old site prevents many industries from
                moving to new locations. These might certainly be absent at the new sites or their
                implantation in the new sites may be very costly.
                9. Fear of loss of market: Change in location means old markets area abandoned and new ones
                sought. It may be very risky for an industry to take such a risk. To avoid uncertainty many
                industrialist will prefer to remain at their old sites and maintain their old customers.
                10. Avoid time cost: Time is an important factor in business. The time that may be lost in order
                to dismantle an industry from an old site to a new location may cause many other problems
                such as loss of market.
                11. Avoid loss of established reputation: Long existence in a location develops credibility. At
                new site it is not easy cultivating it and even when possible, it is costly because it must be
                through advertisement and promotion.
                12. Presence of economic and social facilities: At old sites, such facilities include resorts,
                weekends, restaurants, banks, insurance companies, market oriented industries and service
                industries. Since it is not easy to provide these amenities at new sites, industries stay at old
                sites to use them.
                Implications (Advantages/Disadvantages)
                Advantages--------------
                Low cost on capital equipment

                TRENDSIN
                MANUFACTURING
                A. High Technology Industries
                INDUSTRIES
                a. Meaning: This is a term that describes the group of industries that took root since 1975,
                whose processing techniques often involve electronics, but may include medical instruments,
                biotechnology and pharmaceutics. They are popularly called high technology and
                information industries. Examples include computers and pocket calculators, microchips
                (silicon chips), lasers, robotics, medical equipment (health care), etc.
                Characteristics------
                They make use of high inputs of scientific research and development (R&D). this is why at
                their heart lies the semi-conductor industry, computers and related software products.
                They witness rapid technological change with ever shortening of products life cycles and a
                rapid growth in demand.
                They produce innovative and technological advanced products. They are based on a series of
                dramatic steps made in micro electronic technology since the 1960s and semi-conductors
                since the late 1940s.
                They have a dual structure. That is they maintain strong links between large Multinational
                Corporation (MNCs) and smaller brain intensive enterprises.
                They are highly capital intensive with the automation of the basic assembly stages increasing
                rapidly.
                They also locate in areas which David Smith terms as “areas of maximum profit”.
                They have rapid growth rates with the rate averaging over 10% annually since the 1970s.
                b. Causes of their rapid development----
                There is good land communication in places like San Francisco, Los Angeles and by air to
                the Mid-West, south and east coast.
                Capital is rapidly available since there is easy access to capital through banks, stock
                exchanges and other financial institutions.
                Abundant cheap labour is available as there is access to West coast cheap labour, Vietnamese
                and Hispanics (Indians).
                Technical infrastructure was available
                Alarge number of interacting specialist firms was also available
                c. Consequences
                Congestion: The California’s Bay area which stretches from San Francisco through Silicon
                Valley to San Jose has become so overcrowded that it has no room for any more people.
                Traffic congestion is legendary and there is insufficient infrastructure to accommodate
                growth.--
                Rising cost: The phenomenal growth has rapidly property values in the area. The San
                Francisco region has the highest average housing prices in USA and doubles that of Los
                Angeles. 3% compared with 10% nationally.
                Californication: This is a term describing an “assemble” of problems that have cropped up
                in the “Silicon Valley” since the phenomenal growth. These are over-expansion,; lack of
                space; increased labour cost; air pollution and social reaction to growth (Californication).
                Decentralization: This is the result of the problems raised in (C). For example, Apple
                computers with 20 branches in Silicon Valley now have branch plants in Texas, Singapore
                and Ireland. This reveals that just as the “Cambridge Phenomenon”, the “Silicon Valley
                High-Tech Phenomenon”, is also a mixed blessing.
                B. Multinational Corporations
                a. Meaning: A multinational Corporation (MNC) or Transnational Corporation (TNC) is a
                company or large business organization operating in more than one country. It is thus an
                organization that has operations in a large number of countries regardless of national
                boundaries. They are also enormous industrial units with worldwide functional linkages and
                in certain cases, some degree of social, cultural and even political power. Prominent
                examples are Coca cola, Pepsi, Bp, Esso (Exxon-the first in the world), Texaco, Shell and
                ELF (for oil production).
                b. Causes of Multinationals
                 Highfinancial demands of the modern industry: The rise in MNCs has been seen as a further
                development of the process that started during the industrial revolution. Growth in
                technological advancement requires much larger capital investment in specialized machinery
                and plants, highly organized research, sales and administration, catering for both world and
                home markets. Hence only large companies can provide huge capital needed for such
                investments.
                 Varied demand: The nature of demand for products today is such that only large companies
                and corporations have the capital and expertise to make many types of products on the scale
                which present market demands require.
                c. Consequences of MNCs
                Positive------------
                Catalyst for further industrial development
                Anchor for development of the industrial region
                Inflow of capital to help promote economic development
                Transfer of technological and entrepreneurial skills
                Government income from taxes and royalties imposed on multinational plants and companies.
                Providers of employment opportunities and skill development increasing spending power and
                aspirations in the community.
                Negative
                Economic dependency by government on multinational companies
                Direct flow of government funding away from other sectors of the economy-particularly
                agriculture into providing incentives including enterprise zones to attract multinationals.
                Truncates economy-multinationals plants not integrated into the economy but oriented to
                exports and strategy of the MNCs
                Powerful political influence affecting sovereignty and policies of state
                Exploitation of labour
                Undermine national culture, westernization of attitudes and consumption patterns.
                Environmental damage in areas of industrialization and resource exploitation.
                C. Deindustrialization
                a. Meaning: It is a drastic fall in the number of workers employed in manufacturing. This is
                caused by technological revolution such as the introduction of automation, robotics,
                computers and microsystems which have made the production of gods less labour intensive.
                There are two types of deindustrialization as follows:
                 Positive deindustrialization: It occurs when industries reduce their workforce to increase
                productivity through mechanization and rationalization.
                 Negative deindustrialization: It occurs when an industry declines without any
                compensatory rise in productivity or mechanization.
                D. Reindustrialisation
                a. Meaning: Reindustrialisation is the growth of high technological industries, small firms and
                service industries (tertiarisation). High technology industries refer usually to industries
                developed in the last twenty five years and whose processing techniques often involves
                microelectronics. Many are foot loose. High technology industries are based on modern and
                latest technology and include those that manufacture; computers, silicon chips, lasers,
                robotics,
                aerospace,
                medical
                telecommunication equipment.

                MODEL
                and
                This is the most important theory developed on the basis of least cost. This was propounded by a
                German spatial economist, Alfred Weber in his book entitled “theory of the location of
                industries” published in 1909. It was later translated into English and this English version was
                published in 1929 by the University of Chicago Press.
                A. Aims and Assumptions
                Aims------
                To advance factors (concentrated on cost) he claimed industrialist must consider when
                attempting choosing an optimal location.
                To establish that the manufacturer would best locate where the sum total of transport costs
                (involved in the collection of raw materials and the distribution of finished products) are least
                Assumptions
                He assumed an isolated state with an isotropic plain (area of flat relief; uniform climate,
                culture, political and economic characteristics). The area is therefore a closed economy
                where there is nothing to distort demand and supply.
                Man behaves rationally. This means that the entrepreneurs aim of higher profits and take
                economically best decisions. As such, the sole aim of the producer is profit maximization.
                That perfect competition exists in the market across the plain with one price. This means that
                the numbers of markets and raw materials points are unlimited across the plain and as such,
                there is no monopolistic conditions as no single producer can control the market since there
                are numerous producers with all having perfect knowledge of production possibilities.
                That the size and location of markets are fixed over the plain.
                Entrepreneurs had equal knowledge related to their industry and same motivation to work.
                Most raw materials are not evenly distributed across the plain and are separated from market.
                Thus he identified ubiquitous resources (these are resources that are found everywhere as
                water) as opposed to the sporadic or localized (found in fixed points).--
                That the supply of labour was readily available at several fixed locations on the plain. At
                each point labour was paid same wages as it has the same skills and was immobile.
                Only one industry is engaged in production within his location zone.
                Transport costs are a function of the mass (weight) of raw materials and finished product, and
                the distance it has to be moved. Thus, transport costs are expressed in tonnes per kilometer
                and it is directly proportional to distance.
                B. Principle of Material Index (MI)
                This is a statistical device established by Weber to show the ratio (relationship) between the total
                weight of raw materials and the weight of finished products to be transported. This formula
                therefore compares the weight of the raw material and that of the finished product, to produce a
                ratio and from the ratio, Weber determined whether an industry was weight loosing, weight
                gaining or indifference. This was then the basis of choosing the least transport cost location.
                This formula can be modified to determine directly ratio of the transport cost as follows:
                Using this formula, Weber established three principal situations least transport location as
                follows:
                 If the material index (MI) is greater than 1, the raw material must have experienced loss-of
                weight in the manufacturing process. In this case, the raw material is said to be more gross,
                bulkier and heavier than the finished product. The cut down on transport costs (savings)
                would be made if the industry locates nearer the source of raw material. These weight loss
                industries therefore become raw material oriented so as to avoid high transport cost that
                would reduce profit. An example is the case of tea production which experiences a
                significant drop in weight and bulk after processing there by making the transportation of raw
                materials are more expensive. For example, in Cameroon all tea factories are located in the
                tea plantations of Tole, Ndu and Djutitsa. E.g. if 6 tons of raw materials (Iron and coal) are
                used to produce 1ton of finished product (steel), what would be the material index (MI)?
                 If MI is less than 1, then the raw material gains weight during manufacturing. To make
                saving on transport costs, the industry should be located nearer the market. These weight
                gain industries are therefore market oriented. In this case, the finished products are more
                expensive to transport. Examples of such industries are those that add ubiquitous raw
                material (water) into pure raw materials to enable them produce the finished products. The
                finished products are therefore of greater weight than the original raw materials. Some of
                these industries are brewery, bakeries, automobiles and refrigerators. E.g. if one ton of raw
                material is used to produce 5 tons of the finished products, what would be the material index?
                 Where the MI is exactly 1, the raw material is pure. It neither gains nor looses weight during
                manufacturing. These industries can locate at any point between the sources of raw material
                and the consumption centre. This is because transport costs for moving raw materials and
                that for moving finished products are the same. The location of industries in this case is
                neutral (at intermediate points) or foot loose (anywhere between the raw material source and
                the market). The Hi-technology industries and MNCs fall into these categories of least
                transport cost location.
                C. Location Factors
                a. Transport Factor
                In order to obtain the optimum location, he started with the search for the least transport cost
                location. He held that transport cost was the most fundamental cost in the quest for optimal
                location of plants, thus lies above all other factors and overrides the processing costs. This
                emphasis was based on his argument that “the transport cost of raw materials from their sources
                to the industry and the finished products from the industry to the market play the decisive role in
                determining the least cost location”. The ideal location should be where the total cost of
                assembling raw materials at the industry and that of evacuating finished products to the market
                or consumer are at minimum. Following this therefore, the industry would be best located where
                it would be cheapest to bring raw materials to the production point and finished products to the
                market.
                In advancing this factor, he considered greatly the concept of weight in the raw material to be
                moved, processed and consumed. This was because he held that raw materials are heavy and
                bulky therefore entail high cost of transporting them.
                Least Transport Cost Location Points
                Using the MI, he advanced the different least transport cost industrial locations. In elaborating
                this he used the two approaches of industrial location line and the industrial locations triangle as
                follows:
                 TheIndustrial Location Line: Weber introduced this to site Least Cost Location (LCL) for
                the case where industries used a single raw material at one producing centre to produce one
                final product for a lone market. This is illustrated on the following figure:

                One gross localized raw material raw material (MI is greater than 1, so the industry is weight
                loss). It is therefore cheaper to locate plant (factory) at or nearer the source of raw materials
                as there is no need paying transport cost if some of the materials will be left as waste
                products.
                One ubiquitous raw material or one pure localized raw material gaining weight on
                manufacture (MI<1). If raw material is found all over the plain (that is, ubiquitous) then
                transport is unnecessary as it is already found at the market. If a pure raw material gains mass
                and weight after manufacturing, it will be cheaper to move the raw material rather than the
                heavier finished product. The LCL will therefore be at the market.
                One pure localized raw material which neither gains nor looses weight during manufacture
                (MI=1). The LCL can either be at market, raw material source or any intermediate point.
                Thus it is a foot loose location.
                Two ubiquitous raw materials which are either gross or pure. Since they are found
                everywhere, they do not have to be transported and so the LCL is at the market.
                 TheIndustrial Location Triangle: He used this in the case where industries used more than
                one raw material at a lone industrial plant to produce one final product for one consuming
                centre (market). This is based on movement minimization as the best means of avoiding costs.
                It also holds that firms pay the same transport cost (km/ton) for bringing raw material into the
                production plants as it does for conveying its finished products to the market. The locational
                triangle simplifies the complex reality as its represents a lone manufacturing base, only two
                sources of raw material and single market centre.

                M
                According to this diagram, the industry is expected to locate somewhere within the triangle. This
                will be where the transport cost of moving both raw materials and finished products multiplied
                by the distance is least (Lowest). This is important because raw materials must reach the
                production plants and finished products the market. Transport cost here are therefore calculated
                by multiplying the weight of material or product by the distance over which they are carried.
                Thus it is the cost of moving raw materials and finished products determined by the weight and
                distance that is important. Due to this, it is observed that the production point is pulled by each of
                the corners of the triangle according to the weight of either the raw material or the finished
                product. Consequently, raw material 1 which is the heaviest (400 tons) and thus with the highest
                MI, pulls the industrial location much more proportionately than raw material 2 and the finished
                product sold at M (the market). Weber then established simplified locational triangle for different
                least transport cost locations taking into consideration the weight of raw materials and the
                finished product. He assumed two points of raw materials (R1 & R2) and a single market.

                Source: Adopted from Whynne, 1986:125
                The location of the industry at the Least Transport Cost Location takes place anywhere inside the
                triangle depending on the cost of moving raw materials to the industry and finished products
                from the industry to the market. As shown on the triangle, the following four situations are taken
                into consideration before locating the industry in the triangle:----
                When transport costs are equal both to bring RMs to the industry and finished products to the
                market (A)
                Where raw materials (Rs) loss weight in the manufacturing process (B)
                Where the (Rs) gain weight in the manufacturing process (C)
                Where R2 loses weight more than R1
                 For triangle A, it is an intermediate location situation in which the transport cost of raw
                materials and finished products are the same. This is because the weight of the raw materials
                and finished products are same giving a MI of 1. The production plant (P) is at the centre of
                the triangle so as to minimize transport cost of the over total distance covered. In this case the
                transport cost is shared equally between the raw material and the finished product.
                 In the case of triangle B, it’s a weight-loosing location situation. The total weight of raw
                materials is higher than that of the finished product, thereby giving a MI greater than 1. In
                order to minimize transport cost, the industrial plant (P) is nearer the raw material sources
                than the market. This is thus a raw material oriented industry. This can occur under the
                conditions like; the case of two raw materials both being gross and licalised or when one of
                the raw materials looses more mass and weight than the other, thus pulling the LCL (P)
                closer to it.
                 Triangle C illustrates the situation of weight-gain industry. The weight of the finished
                product is greater than the combined weight of the two raw materials giving it a MI of less
                than 1. The LCL point (P) is nearer to the market (M) in order to minimize transport cost,
                since the heavier finished product is transported over a shorter distance. This usually occur
                generally in the case of all pure raw materials and ubiquitous raw materials be them pure or
                gross.
                b. TheLabour Cost Factor
                Weber observed that the first factor which is likely to influence location outside the LTCL (Least
                Transport Cost Location) is Least Labour Cost (LLC). He however emphasized that such a
                deviation (movement) from least transport cost location (LTCL) is only possible if profits
                (savings) gained from the cheap labour location are more than the increases cost of transport
                incurred by moving from LTCL to such site. Thus, it is only possible if this movement leads to
                fall in total cost and enhanced profit maximization. These industries abandoning LTCL for LLC
                location are those that use labour in great quantities and so benefit from reduced wages thus
                making some savings. If these savings can more than compensate the extra transport cost
                incurred for abandoning LTCL, these locations are worthwhile. He plotted isodapanes showing
                increase in transport cost due to such movements as illustrated on the following diagrams.
                Here, it does not matter where RM, M or L are, but the interest is on profit maximization. Here,
                the labour savings are £3 at each of the labour locations L1 and L2. This illustration shows that
                labour costs are highly influenced by transport cost. This is seen as transport cost rises from P
                outwards. The industry is located at P with isodapane £1 on a least transport cost basis. But
                because of the available cheap labour sites at L1 and L2, deviations are possible from P, where
                savings on labour could be done by £1per unit of production.
                c. TheAgglomeration Factor
                Weber advanced this not as a cost factor but as a local factor which may influence location
                outside the least cost location (transport and labour cost). Weber noticed that the Least Transport
                cost location (LTCL) and the Least Labour Cost Location (LLCL) could be modified in the case
                where there are cost savings resulting from the spatial agglomeration of industries where one
                benefits from the other. as the firms share the amenities available on the shared site they can
                therefore enjoy economies which will help to offset high transport or labour costs on such a
                favourable location site. He considered agglomeration as a situation when several firms choose
                the same area as their location in order to minimize cost. This can be achieved by linkages
                between firms, within firms, between firms supporting services and sharing cost. He equally
                advanced that industries locate to enjoy these advantages which are mostly in the form of
                external economies. He therefore used critical isodapanes of five least cost located firms A, B, C,
                D and E to illustrate the effects of the tendency of industries to agglomerate on industrial
                location as shown below.
                D. Applicability and Criticisms
                a. Applicability
                Smith (in Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 21, 1955, PP.1-18) applied the
                material index formula to a variety of British industries and found it operational.----
                Many MNCs seek supplies of cheap labour not only in the LEDCs but also in MEDCs as
                Europe. For example, the car plants at Zaragoza and Valencia in Spain are for the purpose of
                obtaining abundant cheap labour
                The increasing global importance of MNCs, with their huge financial and human resources,
                is creating a type of rational being, intent on maximizing profits and with the necessary
                information and backing ti implement research funding.
                New post-war industries, which include car manufacturing, electrical engineering and food
                processing and since the 1980s, micro-electronics and high-tech industries have tended to be
                market oriented. They are said to be foot loose, in the sense that they have a free choice of
                location, unlike the older industries which had to locate near to sources of raw materials
                and/or energy supply.
                Iron and steel works that are found in coastal sites as in Port Talbot (England), Chicago, Rhur,
                coastal towns of Japan are in least cost locations with reliable but cheap transport.
                b. Criticisms
                Positive
                 Bradford and Kent (1977) held that Weber’s work, apart from its overemphasis on transport
                costs and leaving some gaps in our understating in the industrial system as a whole, had not
                yet been replaced. Rather “others have added important principles which when taken together
                with those of Weber help to explain a much more complex industrial world”. So Weber’s
                theory has contributed much to the study of industrial location and he is even credited more
                for starting a theory in this domain, which provoked the thinking of others later on along the
                same line. His idea influenced later writes; Lines, C. and Bolwel, L. (1988) hold that though
                many of Weber’s assumptions are unreal, his ideas highlight the importance of transport
                costs and the possible different orientations of industries to materials, labour and market.
                Negative
                 Themain criticism has been that he was too abstract and there has been much questioning of
                his assumptions about transport and effects of agglomeration. This is because it has been
                observed that the cumulative causation influence agglomerative and deglomerative forces
                have a far more central position totday in industrial location than he allowed.
                 The most important criticism has been that he emphasized only upon supply while holding
                demand constant at a point. This is seen as he analysed only the effects of different cost and
                concentrates much only on minimizing costs. He thus prevented demand (revenue) which
                also directly affects the profitability of the firm from playing a role in plant location.
                 He failed to realize that each country evolved its own industrial patterns and may be in
                different stages of economic development. His generalisations of the whole world are
                therefore overzealous.
                 Although he used only cost in his analysis, he however narrowed the concept of costs. This is
                because he neglected other aspects of costs as purchasing costs, rents, taxes, processing costs
                and environmental costs that also influence industrial locations.
                 His theory is limited just to three factors; transport cost, labour cost, and force of
                agglomeration, thereby neglecting to appreciate the role of environmental factors and
                discretionally factors as human choice.
                 His concept of material index is considered too crude and simplified a measured. This is
                because it is only applicable to primary processing industries or to industries with very high
                or very low indices.

                INDUSTRIAL
                A. Lösch Market Area Theory
                LOCATION
                August Lösch, writing in his book “Economics of Location”, Yale University Press 1945, was the
                first to bring out a general theory of location, with major emphasis on demand, revenue or
                market forces,. He was a German spatial economist who devised a more comprehensive theory
                based on Hotelling’s principle of industrial location and profitability within separate market
                zones.
                Aims: His theory had manifold aims as he was out to establish the following;
                To correct Hotellings and further criticize Weber.--
                To describe and explain the size and shape of market areas within which a location would
                command the highest demand and so produce the greatest or largest revenue.
                Assumptions------
                The area is an isotropic plain having equally transport rates.
                Industries in question produce identical goods. This implies that the branding of goods is
                non-existent and so there is perfect competition.
                Demand is evenly spread in the area, with consumers having the same tastes opportunities,
                purchasing power and technical knowledge. Also, the demand for a product would decrease
                with an increase in the price.
                Transport and prices (market price) of a good have a direct relationship with distance from
                the production centre (increase in the same proportion as distance increases). This is
                especially if increase in price is as a result of increase in transport costs.
                Raw materials are evenly distributed over the area.
                Profit maximization is the central or focal concern of the entrepreneurs. According to Lösch,
                this is only possible if producers make a location choice that would give him the possibility
                of having a reasonably large demand.
                Under normal circumstances, he observed that consumers tended up to go to the nearest
                supplier and it is for this reason that each producer has a trading or market area or field of
                interaction which he controls.
                Principle
                He uses the principle or concept of the threshold limit of a product or range of a product to
                develop his ideas.--
                This is the limit or point on the landscape where the price of the product can just borne by the
                consumer and beyond which the demand for the product falls to nil (zero)
                It is the maximum distance a consumer is willing and able (prepared) to cover in order to
                obtain a given product.
                Analysis
                He argued that each industrial plant has a command over a certain limited are in which its
                products would sell highest. This to him is the optimal location in which the plant commands the
                largest market area and produces the greatest revenue. Beyond this limits of this market area, the
                product would meet with serious competition with those of neighbouring industries because they
                would certainly provide lower prices and so undersell it. With this he emphasized the idea that
                each plant has spatial monopoly of its market area and due to this Losch concluded that the
                demand for a product decreases as distances increases form the plant or point of industrial
                location.
                Losch imagined that the delivery of all products is determined by transport cost. As distance
                from the production point increases, the transport cost increases and the price of the product also
                increase. This is so because the manufacturer must cover the extra cost of transport incurred. As
                this happens, demand tends to decrease as distance increases given that prices also increases.
                Since Losch held tenaciously to this economic principle that demand for a product decreases as
                price increases, the resultant demand curve for a product would have the shape of line XPA as
                shown on the following figure:
                Assuming that the price if a product is the result of transport cost, the result is that at a certain
                distance or point from the factory, there will be no (zero) demand. Since this would be so in all
                directions around the factory, the market area would be circular in shape, with demand being
                greatest at the centre and diminishing with distance from the factory. If the demand curve is
                rotated around the production point (P), the shape of the market area will be circular, and the size
                of the marked area would be the volume of the cone QPA as shown on the revenue cones of
                firms below;
                Development of Losch Economic Landscape
                Stage 1: Development of circular Market Areas
                a. Isolated locations forming a triangular lattice: At this stage all producers strive to have the
                largest market areas as possible. As such they are located very far from each other and their
                independent locations form a triangular lattice or pattern on the landscape as seen below
                b. Isolated circular market areas: At this stage each industrial plant develops a circular
                market or trade area around its location (production centre) due to the capturing of
                custoomers in all directions of the market areas to the same distance from the centre of the
                market area. This pattern is illustrated below;
                c. Enlarged circular trade area with unserved areas: As time goes on, the plants gain more
                shares of the market or expand their threshold limits. This enlarges the circular trade areas so
                much that they start touching. This diagram shows that some areas within the landscape have
                no provision despite many consumers. These are considered to have no markets and are
                therefore unserved with good and services from the production point.
                d. Overlapping circular market areas: This rush of entrepreneurs to the region will not only
                compete away the abnormal profits, but will also bring in many more producers than required
                in the area. This will bring in conflict as cut-throat competition sets in. this is seen as the
                market areas of the neighbouring producing points overlap as shown below.
                This situation of overlapping market areas for factories producing identical goods is undesired by
                the producers. This is because overlapping reduces the size of the market area and also the
                revenue and therefore reduces the profit margin. In this situation therefore, a new arrangement
                must be made which will cancel the overlapping market areas. This brings in the stage of the his
                landscape evolution which is the development of hexagonal market areas.
                Stage 2: Development of Hexagonal Market Areas
                In order to solve the problems of void (unserved areas), exclusion, overlapping and guarantee the
                differentiation of market areas, Losch advocated the collapsing of the overlapping areas. this
                entails the sharing of the overlapping areas as illustrated below. This results in a region in which
                factories are spaced evenly with their market areas adjacent to each other being hexagonal in
                shape as shown on figures 8.59 B&C. these hexagonal market areas to Losch represented the
                most efficient shape of trading areas because it gives a factory a monopoly over an area and
                leaves no part of the region without a factory. He thus corrected this spatial landscape only after
                being criticized.
                This second stage of hexagonal market areas was therefore later modified by Christaller. He
                argued that no market area would maintain monopoly over a product. If one assumes that many
                products are produced in the same area, then each of them is going to have a different pattern of
                market areas depending on the transport cost incurred as well as the economies of scale gained
                from each location. Thus, the numbers of producers’ increases, the profits become easily
                competed away. The result is that it causes market areas to become smaller in size.
                Stage C: Development of Complex market Areas
                The third stage is one of the superimposition of all market areas to come out with a common area
                which is the largest for the area. This is shown below.
                The implication of this stage is that some market areas are much more important than others. In
                this wise, Losch argued that the largest market area or centre forms the metropolis. In this much
                larger scale, the factories in the diagram may be viewed instead as distinct estates or even as
                industrial towns, with each having its own hexagonal hinterland.
                Criticisms of the Loschian Market Area Theory
                Positive----
                The demand for cars is evenly distributed in relation to population density in the USA. Most
                are found around the Great Lakes, North East and the Megalopolis of the West. This
                guarantee for the greatest demand.
                Still in the car industry, since the assembling plants are owned by a few giant companies,
                locational planning is easy and inter-company agreement is feasible. This is seen in the
                distribution of Toyota and Nissan plants in Japan.
                His choice of regular hexagons has been confirmed by the elementary packing theory.
                His argument that the price of a product increases with distance away from the production
                point as a result of an increase in transport cost is very valid today in many studies other than
                location of industries.
                The principles of this theory explain why industries as breweries, bakeries and producers of
                office equipment are found I cities where demand is highest. Also, it explains the location of
                weight gain industries.
                Negative------
                His theory has an abstract nature and it failed to take into account the problems resulting
                from location interdependence of plants.
                He overemphasized demand just as Weber did for supply
                He failed to realize the fact that different transport modes exercise different transport costs.
                Weber realized this and proposed a transport re-orientation
                The theory is rigid and oversights the influence of variations in topography, accessibility,
                cultural and political differences and even entrepreneurial ability on location decisions.
                He advocated a rigid control of the landscape. This contradicts his theory as this suggests a
                planned or state-controlled rather than a free competitive exchange system.
                Neighbouring producers do not negotiate market areas but rather in competition using the
                price mechanism to acquire more customers within the area of competition and competition
                will obviously lead to reduction in revenue.
                He also uses the economic man concept (which is unrealistic) but ignores the behavioural
                aspect of locational choice
                Conclusion
                From the analysis Losch emphasized that; each product has its own demand and therefore its
                own market area. These different factories will have different industrial complexes. These sizes
                of market areas depend on the factors such as transport cost and it position in the price of the
                product; production cost; price strategy; location and what economies of scale is obtained at it.
                Also according to him, industries should locate as close as possible to their market. For many
                firms this means urban location and weight-gaining industries in particular such as brewing and
                baking are attracted to sites close to the market.
                B. David Smiths Space-Cost Theory
                In 1971, David M Smith developed a theoretical model based on Rawstron’s Spatial margin
                which combined the best ideas of the Least Cost and Maximum Revenue theories to explain the
                choice of Optimum Location of firms. Their view offered a more realistic method of analyzing
                locational preference as it is based on location areas rather than points. This is one of the few
                original concepts devised by a geographer.
                Aims
                To show how the simple interaction between costs and revenues in space affects industrial
                location choice.----
                To show that industrialists strive for profitable areas for location rather than points.
                Cost and price at any place are fixed and cannot be altered by an industrial firm through
                changes in production techniques and input combinations of better management.
                Afirm’s output is constant in space
                Demand is constant and so any variations in demand will be reflected in price variations from
                place to place.
                Principle
                The basis of his model is the fact that “costs and revenues vary from place to place, resulting in
                varying levels of profits at different locations”.
                Analysis of principle
                With these elements held constant, it is realized that the sole determinant of location of the
                industrial plant is an interaction between cost and price. Hence, profits will be high where prices
                are high and costs low and will be low where prices are low and costs high. In an attempt to
                investigate this, smith used diagrams of cost and price curves in his analysis so as to establish the
                spatial margins of profitability and not mere points. This picture is illustrated on the following
                figure:
                He defined the spatial margins or points of profitability as “the points beyond which profits are
                no longer obtained if location is made; or lines containing the areas within which a particular
                productive activity can be undertaken profitably”. He used several situations in his analysis as
                follows:----
                Demand (sales) or prices held constant but with cost allowed to vary
                Cost (supply) held constant but with demand (sales) or prices allowed to vary
                Cost and prices allowed to vary spatially (real situation) as in the world
                Changes over time
                Situation 1: Demand (Revenue) or prices is held constant but cost or supply is allowed to
                vary spatially: In this situation, which is the simplest version of the model, demand is constant
                as
                indicated by the constant price line, indicating that the price of the product is the same
                everywhere. This makes revenue received at all levels or points to be equal. Also the production
                costs component of the total cost of production are considered to be the same everywhere and
                only the transport cost component is allowed to vary with distance from a certain point as shown
                by the sloping curves or lines into a V-shape. The lowest part of the V (point O) shows the point
                where costs are lowest and then increases with distance from this point and goes beyond the
                price line till where it becomes highest at the point where it hooks up with the lines of the
                vertical axes on both sides. This gives the cost curves known as Space Cost Curves as seen on
                the diagram below:
                From the diagrams, revenue or price or sales is held constant while costs vary in other words, the
                space revenue curve is held constant. This means that the price of the product is the same
                everywhere.
                Situation 2: Supply or cost is held constant but price is allowed to vary spatially: In this
                situation, cost is held constant but demand is allowed to vary. This causes the price got by the
                producer to vary thereby making the revenue to also vary. The revenue (price) declines from the
                centre O, in both directions as distance increases from O. this give rise to a Space Revenue
                Curve (a curve that shows revenue variations in space). This indicates the revenue to be earned
                from a given volume of sales. The space-revenue curve unlike the space-cost curve has but a Ʌ
                shape as shown on the following diagram:
                The point O (fig.8.67A) is that of maximum revenue and minimum cost. As cost is constant and
                lowest at this point, maximum profits are made. These profits then decrease with falling revenue
                towards Ma and Mb (the spatial margins). Beyond Ma and Mb or spatial margins, profits cease
                and losses set in as the cost of production exceeds return/sales.
                Situation 3: Both cost and price are allowed to vary spatially: This is the situation prevailing
                in nature as under real world conditions both cost and revenue are allowed to vary. This set up is
                shown on the following figure:
                The diagram reveals that cost increases from point O outward while revenue decreases from
                point B outwards as in figure 8.68A. The point B is shown as the maximum revenue point while
                O is the least cost location point as illustrated in figure 8.68B. As the cost increases and the
                revenue decreases, they intersect at a point referred to as spatial margins. Thus judging from
                these diagrams, the maximum profit is at O, that is the lowest cost location point despite the fact
                that revenue is not highest. This is because the difference between the space-revenue and the
                space-cost curves is greatest here.
                Situation 4: Changes over time: In nature conditions do not remain the same for long. This is
                due to the fact that the conditions of demand and supply constantly change due to mutations in
                economic, social and even political conditions. These in consequence cause the spatial margins
                of profitability and area of maximum profits to shift as shown below;
                These represent more complex situations in which a more complicated cost environment with
                zones of high and low cost production resulting in three sets of spatial margins of profitability.
                From figure 8.69A, the bold down pointing arrows represent the original spatial margins to
                profitability, and the bold space cost and space revenue curves show the original cost and
                revenue variation curve. The faint curves show the new space cost space curves and down
                pointing arrows show the new spatial margins to profitability.
                Findings
                From the four situations examined above, it is observed that beyond points Ma and Mb profits
                cease to exist as there is a move from profits points to those of losses. Thus the points Ma and
                Mb are the margins to profit on the location space. Beyond these spatial margins to profitability,
                total revenue falls below total cost leading to negative profits or losses. Based on this, Smith
                made the following conclusions----
                Profits will reduce therefore in all directions from the optimal locations which will represent
                the point of maximum profits.
                The spatial margins to profitability binds and area within which profits can be made. Out of
                these limits, the idea of profit maximization is abandoned.
                Optimal locations need not be at least cost or maximum revenue points but are rather where
                revenue exceeds cost by highest amounts.
                Losses are made when production cost is above price or revenue.
                Significance of the theory----
                It focuses on limits to freedom of loation choice on the part of entrepreneur (planners) with
                imperfect ability and knowledge, and away from a single point where profits may be
                maximized.
                The spatial margins can also be used to show the effects of government legislation on
                industrial location
                The concept of area of profitability rather than an individual least cost location (point)
                applies widely across the globe.
                The spatial margin approach includes both the satisfying behavior as well as the optimizing
                behavior in the theory.
                Although it is very difficult to identify the spatial margin of profitability the concept of
                considerable value in predicting the likely extend of constraints on locational choice
                especially where information on spatial variations in cost and revenue is limited.

                SUB-OPTIMAL
                A. Meaning
                INDUSTRIAL
                LOCATION
                The basic economic assumption on industrial location holds that firms seek to maximize profit.
                For this reason, they look for the “economic or optimal location” where revenue is maximum or
                cost least, or both. But since not all entrepreneurs are economic men, for this reason or the other,
                they may abandon optimum for sub optimum sites. This brings in the concept of sub optimality.
                Thus sub optimality refers to the tendency for firms to make those location decisions which are
                not the most economically rewarding. It is the tendency for firms to occupy at sub-optimal
                locations. Sub-optimal location refers to a location which is profitable but not the best in terms of
                the primary aim of the entrepreneur or firm (minimum cost, maximum profit, and maximum
                pleasure). In other words, they do not yield maximum profits. It is therefore the location of
                industries outside the optimum location, or where profits are made but they are not the highest.
                That is, sub-optimal locations make just normal profit to keep the entrepreneur in production and
                the profit maximization motive is absent.
                B. Reasons for Sub-Optimal Location
                a. They may have imperfect knowledge of production and market demand: They may also
                have imperfect decisions makers who do not always act rationally and can be tempted to
                locate in areas of high unemployment. Following Pred’s behavioural matrix, sub optimal
                locations are based on poor knowledge. If an industrialist has he or she will locate his/her
                firm at an optimial site. High ability and top quality information gives an optimal location.
                b. Government policy: An industry may not locate in an economically best site due to
                government influence. In many places the government decides upon the site for the location
                of industries. The government may favour or disfavor the location of an industry at a
                particular site through her taxation policy, granting of subsidies or loans and grants.
                c. Perception or satisfier solution or concept: An industrialist may prefer to accept a
                “psychological income” and accept any location that offers a satisfactory level of
                productivity and profits for various reasons such as the development of this village rather
                than locate in an area that offers maximum profits (optimal site).
                d. Future aspirations: Young industries that aspire for future expansion may select an area
                where land is vast and cheap rather than a site that can offer maximum profits.
                e. Strategic reasons: An industry that manufactures arms may locate at its sub optimal site
                because it requires government protection. It is the governments that usually decide the
                location of such key industries, which are not out to maximize profits. It should however be
                noted that an industry that one country may consider strategic, may not necessarily be a
                strategic industry in another country.
                f.
                Foot loose industries: Industries like MTN and Sunny companies which are not tied to raw
                materials, have a free choice of location. They can locate at the sub optimal site.
                g. Industrial inertia: Some industries have suboptimal locations because of already existing
                fixed capital installation and environmental conditions which had initially promoted the
                location. Industries thus, resist movement out of sub optimal sites. Some are attracted to them
                to benefit from these installations.
                h. Functional linkages: Industries which develop more firms may tend to have sub optimally
                located firms catering for other aspects of production in the industry. Most of these firms will
                be those supplying component parts. This has been promoted by the JIT production approach
                and it is very common with the car industry.
                i.
                j.
                Transport development: The area of highly developed transport networks tends to have sub
                optimally located firms. This is because since the area is well highly accessible, transport
                costs tend to be reduced. The cheaper transport tends to lure and attracts many firms and
                industries into such regions even though to some, these are not their optimal location zones.
                Pollution: Industries causing social costs as toxic waste are always located on the basis of
                the security of the population. Consequently, they may not necessarily take industrial
                location factors into consideration. In consequence, many lie out of optimum location since
                most optimal locations are centres of high population concentration.
                k. Labour cost factor: Most industries find labour, capital and market at one spot as town.
                They tend to prefer such areas even if profits are not being maximized. This is typical of the
                location of industries in the LEDCs. For example in Cameroon industries are in urban zones
                as Bastos in Yaounde, Bassa, Bonaberi in Douala along the coast, Edea, etc.

                IMPACTS
                ENVIRONMENT
                OF
                MANUFACTURING
                INDUSTRIES
                ONTHE
                NATURAL
                The activities of manufacturing industries greatly infringe on the parameters of the environment.
                In fact manufacturing industries by far are the economic activity that impact more adversely on
                the environment. The main environmental problem is pollution especially that of the atmosphere
                but they generally create externalities (side effects which are both positive and negative of an
                economic activity that are experienced beyond its site or the factory gates.
                A. Negative Effects
                1. Climatic modification: This is manifested in the following ways:
                a. Global warming: It is seen as the general rise in global temperatures due to the emission of
                greenhouse gases like hydrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
                etc. This is because of burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas.
                b. Acid rain: This is a situation where rain falling has a pH of around 3, instead of the natural
                level between a pH of 5and 6. Thus rainfall changes from weak acid (carbonic acid) resulting
                from the absorption of carbon dioxide, into a strong acid (nitric and weak sulphuric) due to
                the absorption of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). It occur in tow forms i.e.
                dry deposition (occurs close to the source of emission and is deposited as powder. It causes
                damage to buildings and structures) and wet deposition (occurs when the acids are dissolved
                in precipitation and may fall at a great distance from the sources. It is also called trans
                frontier pollution as it crosses freely international boundaries).
                c. Effects on atmospheric composition through air pollution: The most serious polluters are the
                large-scale processing industries which tend to for agglomerations as they have similar
                location requirements. The impacts of such large industries may spread pollutants well
                beyond the locality and region to cross international borders, though at reducing intensity
                from emission sites. For example prevailing winds in Europe carry pollutants from west to
                east thus the problem of acid rain the Scandinavia is partly due to industrial activities in
                Britain.
                2. Pollution and economic development: There is a direct relationship between pollution,
                population growth and economic development. Poor countries have high levels because of
                their weaker economies.
                3. Contamination of the land: Deposited waste of manufacturing activities on land
                accumulates. With time, these substances concentrate to levels that are sufficient to be
                harmful to the humans, animals and/or the environment.
                4. Loss of forest and natural scenic beauty: There is forest loss through deforestation to
                create space for industrial plants, parking lots and warehouses. The natural landscape is
                turned into an artificial landscape. This is especially if the industrial growth has initiated and
                engendered urban growth. The natural landscape is transformed into a “giant city” ecosystem.
                B. Solutions
                 Tocombat the problem of acidification, curative measures (i.e. adding powered limestone to
                lakes to increase their pH values, once contaminated) and preventive measure have been used.
                 Pollution is been controlled through the strict implementation of environmental legislation on
                MEDCs with the polluter called upon to pay for the cost of their actions themselves rather
                than expecting society as a whole to pay the costs.
                 The relocation of the most polluting activities such as commodity processing and heavy
                manufacturing to the emerging market has been implemented.
                 Forcontamination of land, the removal (carriage) of contaminating substances has been used.
                Also, the use of steam, hot air stripping or even freezing with liquid nitrogen to prevent
                further movement of contaminants to the ground. There has also been the biological method
                which is through the use of hydrocarbon, degrading microorganisms to accelerate the natural
                degeneration of soil.
                 Tofight against deforestation, afforestation and reforestation schemes are being encouraged
                in most parts of the world. There has also been the encouragement of creation of greenbelts
                in most cities of the world.

                OF
                TRANSPORT
                Lesson
                26:
                TRANSPORT
                A. Meaning of transport
                Transport is the physical carriage of people and goods from place to place. The important part
                played by the transport industry is clearly seen in the number of people employed in this sector.
                In all countries, there is the need to develop new facilities, improve and extend the existing
                facilities. This would make it possible to open up new lands or regions of the country to make
                settlement, marketing of industrial and agricultural products possible. Thus the development of
                the various modes of transport is fundamental to the functioning of society.
                B. Different Transport Modes
                1. Land Transport: This involves all forms of transport modes occurring on the terrestrial part
                of the world and includes road, rail and pipelines and to a lesser extends animals.
                a. Road transport: This is the oldest as well as the most used mode of transport in the world.
                Every human society no matter how insignificant or primitive it may be will become
                attractive and modern if there is a greater multiplication of roads constructed to such regions.
                Factors influencing road transport development--------
                The nature of topography (hills or flatland)
                Nature of drainage (marshes/swamps, rivers, lakes)
                Vegetation (dense forest or grassland)
                Climate (rainfall)
                Nature of soils
                Influence of government
                Agitation and the rise of political parties
                Population density and distribution
                To evacuate raw materials from their sources to production points and move manufactured
                goods to consumption areas
                To tap areas of potential economic production
                Advantages of road transport------
                It has great flexibility of service since numerous routes and destinations are possible
                It offers directness between regions i.e. roads form a direct link between the producer and
                consumer and make a door-to-door service possible through many roads and to various
                destinations.
                Comparatively greater speed and cheapness over short distances but trucks are becoming
                increasingly important in carrying heavy products like timber over long distances, thus
                competing with rail transport
                A variety of goods can conveniently be transported by road especially in areas where the
                road network is well developed.
                It acts as a feeder to other modes of transport like railway, water and air.
                Low terminal costs because of simplicity of terminal facilities as parks, offices etc, the cost
                of loading and unloading of cargo is also very low.
                Disadvantages------
                There is high operating or running cost as the vehicles and trucks need constant repairs and
                maintenance although are cheaper to build than other modes.
                The carriage of large amount of goods is difficult and impossible since only relatively small
                amounts can be carried by each vehicle because of space limitation.
                The construction of roads is detrimental to the natural environment and agricultural land in
                the countryside as a lot of destruction takes place before completion.
                Accidents are more frequent along roads. This often leads to damage of goods and loss of
                lives.
                Motor vehicles cause much noise and air pollution especially I urban areas where great
                numbers are found.
                Delays to reach destination are very frequent and may be caused by traffic congestion, bad
                weather, landslides, floods, etc.
                It demands regular servicing including policing. Traffic direction, repairs and provision of
                road furniture.
                b. Rail Transport: Rail transport is the transportation of goods and passengers with the use of
                trains. Railways appear during the industrial revolution in Britain about 1825 and were later
                constructed throughout the developed world. This transport mode became the fastest and
                most popular form of transport for both passengers and goods in the 19th century over land.
                Factors of railway development----------
                Level of technological development: Where the level of technology is high, more and
                modern railway lines would be constructed, but where the level of technology is low railway
                development will be retarded.
                The population density: Vast sparsely populated areas are better for railway development
                than densely populated areas. However, high densities are required especially at terminals to
                ensure high demand and the profitability of this transport mode.
                The degree of development of natural resources/level of economic development: If these are
                high, the level of railway development will also be high.
                The availability and degree of development of other modes of transport. Where the other
                modes are will developed as in the USA, Europe, railway transport is not popular but where
                they are poorly developed it is vital.
                Government influence: Where influence is positive it will be more developed than other
                modes and vice versa where influence is negative.
                Topography: In hilly and marshy areas, railway development would be poor, given the high
                cost involved but in lowland regions well-drained development would be high.
                Availability of capital and skilled manpower.
                Advantages of rail transport
                It has the advantage of transporting bulky and heavy goods and raw materials cheaply and
                over long distances.
                It provides a fast and reliable service. Given that trains run on their own tracks, the chances
                of congestion and delays are minimized as a timetable is being followed.
                It is a relatively clean form of transport with little air pollution; noise pollution is also
                reduced as it passes mostly out of inhabited areas. Some are electrically controlled.
                It is very instrumental in opening up new lands and encouraging industrial development
                Relatively few accidents are recorded by rail transport compared to road transport given that
                it uses specific tracks with less congestion.--------
                It is particularly suited for passenger transport since it provides speed, cheapness and greater
                safety. However beyond a certain distance, it will face competition with air transport.
                Disadvantages of rail transport
                The construction, maintenance and operating costs are high whether the system is being used
                or not.
                It is inflexible as compared to the flexibility of road. This is because the tracks cannot easily
                be moved and transshipment of cargo is often very necessary at termini. It therefore does not
                perform a door-to-door service.
                It is expensive to use over short distances as well as for small cargoes.
                There is often interruption of other transport flows e.g. road traffic at level crossing.
                Rail transport is greatly hampered by relief obstacles. This makes it impossible for this mode
                of transport to be provided in regions of rugged terrain.
                Lines established in the past may become obsolete and thus a financial burden.
                There is often a higher rate of pilferage in rail than road transport.
                2. Water Transport: This existed since early times carrying both people and goods. The early
                agents were rafts and canoes made from logs, skins and bark of trees. Today some are still
                used around coastal and inland waters. Water vessels have greatly increased in size i.e. boats,
                ships, etc. The following are some forms of water ways.
                a. Inland Water ways: This deal with water transport on the continents. Examples of inland
                waterways include rivers, lakes and canals. The boats used on inland waterways have also
                improved and increased in size, speed and efficiency.
                 Rivers: Rivers have been used as a means of transport for a very long time and many are still
                being used today especially if they are naturally navigable and large. Such rivers linking
                regions with rich economies are highly used for the movement of raw materials, semi
                finished and finished goods. Examples include Congo and Amazon, Sanaga, Ganges, Nile,
                etc.
                 Canals: These are specially constructed channels cut through land for either ocean-going or
                inland vessels e.g. the Suez canal and Panama canal. The earliest canals were constructed in
                China. Many of them were built in Britain and other Western European countries in the early
                19th century for the purpose of transporting easily and cheaply coal, iron and other raw
                materials to industrial establishments.
                b. Ocean transport: This is one of the oldest modes of transport that was used for exploration.
                Ocean transport consist of free natural “high ways” traversable in all directions and so is
                open to world shipping at almost no cost. It is the cheapest of all modes of transport because
                there is no maintenance cost as in road, railways or canals.
                 Containerization: This has been one of the most important developments in cargo transport
                in recent years. With containerization (utilized traffics) goods are packed into containers of a
                specified size at the factory, taken by train or lorry to the container port, and easily and
                quickly loaded by specialized equipment. Containers are metal boxes of internationally
                specifies standard size (3m, 6m or 12m long, 2.5m wide, 2.5m or 3m high) in which goods of
                the same type or mixed are packed by the dispatcher. This system of carriage has many
                advantages as follows;--------
                Containers are sealed and thus minimize breakages and theft
                Speed is ensured given the efficient handling methods
                Costs are greatly reduced since a lot of labour is not needed
                Provides regular and frequent services
                By removing the need for dock labour, the importance of ports as trading centres have been
                reduced and hence avoid possible delays and inefficiency incurred during transshipment.
                It has the following disadvantages
                Firms in docklands have been closed down or moved
                Reduction in dock labour resulting in the unemployment of dockers
                Buildings have become redundant.
                Some major shipping routes
                a. North Atlantic route: This is one of the most busy and important routes. It links two most
                industrialised regions which are also highly populated that is Western Europe and N.E USA,
                it has a high volume of ocean traffic. These regions have about half of the world’s ports.
                b. Trans-Pacific route: This links the major ports of Western North America and S.E Asia. On
                the American side, they include San Francisco, Vancouver and Los Angeles and on the side
                of Asia they are Yokohama, Hong Kong, Kobe, Shanghai, Manila, Singapore, etc.
                Manufactured products, dairy products, paper, timber, electrical products, etc. are involved in
                exchange.
                c. The Panama route: This came with the creation of the Panama Canal in 1913. This serves
                mainly the American continent linking the Pacific and Atlantic seaboard.
                d. TheLatin America/European route: This links Latin America ports to those of Europe.
                e. Trans-Indian route: Links up East, S.E Africa, Asia and Australia.
                f.
                European/African route: Links up West Africa and Western Europe.
                Advantages of water transport
                It has the highest capacity for heavy and bulky non-perishable cargoes especially as it uses
                modern vessels for very high freight.------
                It causes relatively little pollution although oil discharge or leakage from tankers may cause
                problems
                Canals provide good access along their line sides and can encourage the development of
                industry and commerce.
                Canals create navigable channels where no natural navigable water exists.
                Rivers are used easily for the transportation of timber through floatage.
                It has natural route network, which is “free” to use. this allows flexibility of service,
                frequency of movement and little congestion.
                It is the cheapest over long distances due to the low running costs.
                Disadvantages of water transport----
                A very slow mode of transport. This makes it unsuitable for the transportation of perishable
                products and urgent cargoes
                It is highly negatively affected by weather conditions such as fog, which may cause ship
                collision because of poor visibility, tropical cyclones which may cause a ship wreck, ice
                bergs and snowfall which may make ports become frozen in winter in temperate areas.
                It has the highest terminal cost compared to other modes of transport.
                Canals are expansive to build, maintain and dredge. They are inflexible and follow circuitous
                routes.
                --
                It may cause a lot of pollution when there is oil discharge or leakage from tankers
                Much land is needed for ports and port facilities like warehouses.
                3. Air Transport: It is comparatively a very new mode of transport which is relatively
                independent of ground conditions. This transport mode became successful in the 20th century.
                In fact of all transport developments of the 20th century, those in air transport have been the
                most striking. It saw its effective take-off with the most successful aeroplane flight in 1903 by
                the Wright brothers. Since then it has revolutionized.
                Factors considered in airport development
                 Topography: Flat well drained stretch of land suitable for the construction of runways and for
                future expansion. It should not be surrounded by mountains or hills.
                 Geology: The area should have firm ground preferably hard basement rocks such as granite
                to avoid any sinking. Thus feasibility studies must be effective.
                 Weather: The weather conditions should be free from clouds, fog and icefall.
                 Dense population: The airport should be near large population centres but should not be built
                too close to these centres owing to noise disturbances and the risk of accidents. In should be
                in such areas because the population will provide as sure demand for this mode of transport.
                 Airports should be free from buildings
                 Theremust be availability of capital to facilitate the provision of port facilities.
                 The site of the airport must be highly accessible in all directions to facilitate movement in
                and out of the area.
                 Thereshould be a high demand to ensure the profitability of the investment
                 The location can also be influenced by the presence of attractive tourist sites with numerous
                hotels, which can serve foreigners.
                Advantages of air transport----
                Little or no cost is incurred in maintenance. Maintenance cost is limited to terminals.
                Congestion is limited except at peak holiday times.
                It causes limited pollution. However it may cause air and noise pollution mainly at terminals.
                Fast and efficient system which is especially suited to passengers traffic, offering comfort
                and high quality service.
                It offers complete freedom of movement and this provide potentially flexible routes and
                services although political factors may restrict landing in certain areas.--------
                It can often reach inaccessible areas, which are impossible for other modes of transport. Thus
                mountain barriers, large oceans, vast forest regions do not handicap air transport as they
                would with other forms of surface transport.
                Suited for the transportation of high quality, expensive, fragile and perishable cargoes. This
                is because of the speed advantage that air transport has.
                Disadvantages of air transport
                It is expensive to build and maintain airports. Also aircrafts are expensive to build and
                operate.
                Dependent on weather conditions and therefore can provide unreliable services
                Can carry only small loads because of space limitation.
                It is very expensive to users compared to other transport modes and this disqualifies it from
                the carriage of heavy, bulky and low value products.
                Airports use up a lot of land and becomes difficult to locate in areas where land is limited
                Even though accidents are rare, when they occur, they are usually very catastrophic with
                some claiming hundreds of lives.
                No flexibility of routes given the insecurity using the air space of some countries without
                permission.
                4. Others (Pipeline and Ropeways or Cable ways)
                a. Pipeline: Pipeline transportation is mostly used for the transportation of liquids and gases.
                For many years the first pipelines were used only for transportation of water, but nowadays,
                it has increasingly become the best mode for the transportation of other liquid products like
                petroleum (oil), milk natural gas, etc. This is particularly developed in North America,
                Middle East and former USSR. There are also few examples in Africa like the Chad
                Cameroon pipeline.
                Advantages of pipeline transport--
                It is very cheap especially over long distances since running costs are low
                There is no congestion so few accidents
                ----------
                Not greatly affected by weather and relief
                Cheap maintenance
                Continuous flow can be carried at a constant rate
                It is a very efficient means transport, fast services with maximum safety provided
                Pipelines cause no pollution in any form especially when buried undergrounds, they cause no
                damage to the environment.
                Disadvantages of pipeline transport
                They are very inflexible since they operate between fixed points and once laid down, they
                remain fixed.
                It carries only a limited range of products (liquid), mostly carry but what they were laid for
                and cannot easily be changed for others.
                Highly vulnerable to natural disasters and human actions.
                A pipeline may be rendered non-operational if there is no demand for the commodity it
                transports.
                Ownership and usage is limited i.e. mainly oil and water companies.
                Expensive to build especially in rugged areas.
                b. Ropeways or Cableways: This mode of transport is quite limited in scope. It is only
                applicable in areas of difficult terrain with deep valleys, wide rivers, forests, mountains,
                glaciers, etc. With modern technology, ropeways can transport for up to 80km and may carry
                up to 500tonnes of cargo. These are popular in Switzerland principally for tourist purposes.
                Advantages------
                No congestion as each has its line
                Fast and efficient as it is electrically controlled
                Facilitates tourism since it transports tourists to difficult relief areas (Switzerland, Alps
                regions).
                Little or no pollution
                Disadvantages
                Passengers might get stranded in case of power failures
                In case of breakage of cables, accidents would be very fatal
                C. General Importance of Transport
                 Improvements in transport has increase spatial interaction, that is migration, the movement of
                goods and services, information and messages.
                 Transport facilities help to expand trade relationships (both internal and external trade). This
                is because goods, services and passengers are able to move from one part of the world to
                another.
                 Improvement in transport has helped to advance agricultural and industrial output e.g. it is
                easy for farm inputs to reach the farmers from the markets. Farm products are also easily
                carried to the market. Improvements in transport also ease the movement of raw materials
                and finished products to where they needed.
                 Transport has helped to increase the growth and has changed the structure of urban areas.
                Some towns or settlements grow up along communication lines. Transport also eases rural
                urban migration, which contributes to urbanization and urban growth.
                 Transport network helps in the development of backward or depressed areas because it
                increases accessibility which favours economic activities like farming and industrialisation.

                TRANSPORT
                A. Meaning
                NETWORKS
                A network is a set of routes which connect junctions and termini. In other words a network is a
                system of interconnecting routes which allows movement from one centre to the others. Network
                development takes place gradually over the years and the form a network takes will reflect not
                only the relief, level of technology, population distribution and level of economic development,
                but will also be influenced by historical and political factors. The overall transport structures or
                networks are integrated patterns which consist of groups of centre or points known as vertices or
                nodes and actual links referred to as edges. Thus a network is made up of vertices and edges.
                a. Vertices or Nodes: These are points of intersection or locations such as junction, settlements
                and terminal in a network. In other words they are points or locations from which edges
                diverge to different directions. Vertices therefore constitute convenient points of growth
                because of their great accessibility.
                b. Edges or Links: These are direct routes connecting two or more vertices. Each edge or link
                is a line of contact may be a road, railway, air or waterway.
                Network analysis is achieved by showing the various locations using dots and the straight lines
                connecting them on a map. Such a map illustrating the network with locations and straight lines
                connecting them is known as a topological map.

                c. Types of Networks
                1. Paul Reverse Network: This is the simplest type of network and it exists where a single
                route connects the five nodes. Its major weakness lies in the fact that when one moves from
                the origin e.g. A to the destination E, any return follows the same pattern or must pass
                through the intervening nodes. From the diagram below, a journey from A to E or vice versa
                must pass through all other vertices (B, C, and D). This makes journey long, slow, tedious
                and costly. Some examples of this type of network include; the railway line from Douala
                Mbanga– Kumba, the Limbe– Idenau road, etc.

                2. Travelling salesman network: This provides the shortest distance around the five nodes or
                vertices and is connected by a single route, but journeys between nodes still involve
                movement through other nodes. For example travelling from B to D will involve passing
                through C and vice versa or from A to D would involve B and C. Such a network exists in
                less developed regions, areas of difficult terrain or islands e.g. the Bamenda Ring road.

                B=Travelling Salesman
                3. Centre-oriented network: This involves the connection of one node (central node) to all the
                others. This often results in congestion in certain points since cross-country movements are
                impossible. This is because all traffic must pass through the centralized node. An example of
                such network is from Bamenda (centre) to surrounding villages, Kumba to surrounding
                villages, etc.

                4. Circuit network: This is a network in which the initial vertex in the linkage sequence
                coincides with the terminal vertex. It is the most efficient network because all the nodes are
                linked to each other by the shortest possible route. A journey from one node to another does
                not necessarily pass through other nodes. This network is common in developed countries.

                5. Branching network: This is a network which offers the shortest route linking all vertices. A
                journey from one node to the other can bypass all the other nodes. This type of network is
                common with rail transport. This network is easier and cheaper to build but expensive to use
                (more time consuming for the user).

                network. They provide fairly efficient routes at less than maximum cost. A good example is
                the London underground railway system.

                B. General factors of transport network development
                1. Relief: The physical geography of a place would influence both the nature of the route, its
                course and cost of construction. In areas of rugged terrain, it becomes difficult and expensive
                to construct any good road, railway or even airports while in areas with undulating or gentle
                relief transport development is easier and less expensive.
                2. Vegetation and drainage: Transport development will also depend on the nature of
                vegetation and drainage of an area. In areas of dense forest with large trees, route
                construction is difficult and expensive given that the trees must be cut down and stumps
                removed. Also regions with large water bodies, a lot of marshy or swampy areas will tend to
                make transport development difficult and expensive as opposed to dry or well-drained areas.
                3. Rentability or profitability of the route: This simply implies the ability of the constructed
                route to pay off itself, that is the mode of transport to be constructed should be economically
                profitable to the country or community in question. Unless the investment promises to be
                profitable, its construction will be economically questionable. This is so because the
                construction of the various modes of transport is both difficult and expensive.
                4. Availability of capital: This permits the acquisition of machinery, technology, and personnel
                necessary to defeat environmental obstacles and carry out route network development. It
                therefore means that in rich countries with enough capital, there will be high transport
                development as opposed to poor countries. This underscores the fact that most networks
                show very close relationship with economic development.
                5. Pattern of population distribution: The way population is distributed in a country
                influences network development. Thus the distribution of transport infrastructure in a country
                usually reflects to some degree, the distribution of population. Routes are easily constructed
                to areas of dense population since they would be used constantly and would be economically
                rentable or profitable.
                6. Political factor: There is need for government to extend its influence over the national
                territory. The presence of government could be felt anywhere transport network is developed.
                The political, economic and social capitals could become more accessible to citizens if the
                transport modes are well developed. This often brings about a sense of belonging and unity
                amongst the people and strengthens their patriotism.
                C. Network Prediction
                The nature of networks, that is connectivity, density, extent, fineness, flexibility, technological
                characteristics are usually determined by factors like topography, shape and size of land,
                population density, level of economic development, social, historical and political factors. All
                these aspects are important in predicting networks. Once the above factors are fully understood,
                the network that a given place is likely to develop can be worked out because the main thing
                required is the study of the cause-and-effect relationships, that is if A, B and C’s regional factors
                are known, X network must result. Such predictive analysis can be divided into two categories i.e.
                forecasting whole network, their evolution and design (pattern) and predicting individual flows,
                their alteration and importance. Both require some degree of environmental and behavioural
                understanding and mathematical skill. The process of network prediction can be made very easy
                if it is based on the assumption of isotropacy that is, where land surfaces are uniform and with
                homogenous population cahracteristics. On the domain of pattern, geographers have identified
                three main patterns of transport networks that are likely to develop on such uniform landscapes.
                They are:
                Population density is low
                a. Thehexagonal pattern: This may result where the following conditions prevail:----
                Limited available capital for development
                Where the need for communication is restricted.
                Where there is a low level of economic development.
                Figure: Hexagonal pattern with three links per node
                b. The rectangular pattern: This pattern represents the next stage up in economic
                development and may be found in are areas where:
                Capital is available but not abundant to result in full development. Thus it can develop
                network only to a certain limit.
                Population density might increase or moderate
                Figure: Rectangular pattern with four links per node
                Abundant capital
                c. Thetriangular pattern: This pattern might be found in areas of:--
                High population density
                Considerable economic mobility
                Lowland relief, etc. It has six links per node and thus the most connected and efficient of all
                the patterns. Such networks would be found in well-established regions of the developed
                world, where many transport links are essential to sustain high standard of living.
                Figure: Triangular pattern with six links per node
                Predicting the evolution and design of networks
                Generally, to predict the pattern of network to be found on a given region is relatively easy but to
                predicts its evolution or how it is likely to change is much more difficult because networks do
                not alter in a pre-determined sequence and future variables are unknown. Based on this, it would
                be difficult for hexagonal networks to evolve into rectangular as seen on the diagrams above. So
                it is common place that instead of networks being modified, new ones are developed and
                superimposed on e.g. the motorway network in Britain. This superimposition is because any
                modification made to a network are likely to be piecemeal and as such are difficult to forecast
                accurately.
                Predicting individual flows
                On a local scale, predictions of individual flow changes can be relatively easier and
                straightforward and that is why many geographers have attempted it. Some models that explain
                migration flows like those of Zipf, Stouffer and Ullman model can easily be adapted to allow for
                predictive analysis. Such analysis can be based on the gravity model expressed by the following
                Where MAB=Movement between towns A and B
                PA=Population of town A
                PB =Population of town B
                DAB=Distance separating the two towns
                By the use of such methods, geographers can attempt to forecast future changes in flow
                characteristics e.g. frequency, speed, etc. and through that, future addition to network links can
                be done.

                TRANSPORT
                A. Meaning
                NETWORK
                EFFICIENCY
                Some networks are more efficient than others. Where they are more efficient, the area is better
                served because transport development is advanced. Others are inefficient indicating that network
                development is still backward. However, the efficiency of all networks can be ascertained from
                measuring common factors such as connectivity, density, extent, fineness, rate of flow, flexibility,
                technological characteristics and degree of stress.
                B. Indices of transport efficiency
                1. Connectivity: It is the degree to which direct movements between nodes are possible as
                opposed to indirect movements. It can also be defined as the connectivity of a network or the
                relationship between the number of nodes and the number of links in a single network.
                2. Density: Network density may be expressed either as the number of links per unit area or as
                the total length of the network divided by the area that it covers. That is:
                Where L= Length
                A=Area covered
                The result of this is a simple ratio measure of density in terms of length per unit area.
                Alternatively, one can also use the ETA INDEX (E.I) which is obtained by dividing the total
                length of the network by the number of links that make it up, that is;
                Where L = Total length of network
                L(E)= Links (edges) that make up the network.
                It therefore require that accurate statistics of the network situation of a country must be obtained
                before calculating the network density. Network density can either indicate economic prosperity
                of economic backwardness.
                3. Degree of Fineness: This is the degree to which a network’s individual links have an effect
                upon the areas through which they pass. This depends partly upon the accessibility to each
                flow as it passes between nodes. For instance, road networks have greater fineness than rail
                networks. Along the average trunk road, there are many points at which other roads join and
                vehicles could easily stop and take off given their flexibility, but along a railway line entry
                and departure are possible on at stations and even then, only if the train stop. Air network has
                the least fineness amongst all the other modes of transport. This is because its flow is totally
                enclosed between nodal points.
                4. Flexibility: This is the ability of a network to link many places. Amongst the various modes
                of transport, road network id the most flexible as it often performs a door-to-door service.
                This is opposed to rail, which is on fixed tracks. Roads are capable of accommodating more
                vehicles than can railways over a given distance and time, and also allowing the use of a
                greater diversity of traffic. Railways can take only trains with the correct wheels, gauges and
                dimensions thus not flexible.
                5. Rate of flow: This is the volume of traffic per given time period per given distance.
                Generally, roads accommodate more traffic than rail, air and water over a given distance and
                time. Thus the rate of flow in road transport is more than that of other modes of transport.
                There are generally more cars than the number of carriers in all other forms of transport.
                6. Technological characteristics and degree of stress: Technological characteristics relate
                largely to speed potential, while stress is a measure of congestion on networks. Air networks
                have an absolute advantage over rail networks in both cases, which in turn have an advantage
                over roads. Road networks are more congested than the other forms of transport.
                C. Transport Network Connectivity
                a. Meaning: As seen earlier, network connectivity is the degree to which direct movements
                between nodes are possible as opposed to indirect movements. It can also be defined as the
                connectivity of a network or the relationship between the number of nodes and the number of
                links in a single network.
                Indices used in measuring network connectivity
                1. Beta Index (β): This is the simplest method of measuring the degree of connectivity. It also
                determines the efficiency of transport network in a particular area and from the index, it can
                be known whether the transport network is highly developed or not and shows the level of
                economic development of an area or region. It is obtained by dividing the total number of
                edges by the total number of vertices.
                Or just
                Or
                Where β = Beta
                Ʃe = Sumof edges
                Ʃv = Sumofvertices
                L= Links
                N=Nodes
                The Beta index value is of great importance in understanding the extent of transport development
                and level of economic development of a region. A beta index of 1 shows that network
                development is moderate or average and it indicates an economic dividing line and has one
                circuit as illustrated by the travelling salesman. If the value is less than 1 that is between 0 to 0.9,
                the network is considered to be poor and thus minimally connected. Finally a beta index of more
                than 1 shows a complex network with high connectivity and it indicates that the economy is
                economically advanced.
                2. Alpha Index (ɑ): This index is very useful when comparing networks. It compares the
                observed or actual number of circuits in a network with the maximum possible number of
                circuits in that network and usually expressed as a percentage. This can be expressed by the
                formula below:
                The following network can be used to apply the formula and calculate the alpha index.
                V
                E
                From this complete graph, the alpha index can be calculated
                Therefore
                Values generally range from 0% and 100% which is the maximum. An alpha index value of 0%
                indicates that it is minimally connected. There is little or no connectivity, no circuits and thus the
                region is economically backward. Index values of between 1% and 100% indicate that the
                network is completely interconnected. Thus network connectivity is high and it is a network with
                maximum circuitry.
                3. GammaIndex (: This compares the actual number of edges in a network with the maximum
                possible number of edges in that network and expressed as a percentage. This is calculated
                using the formula
                If any of the two formulae is used the same results would be obtained.
                Generally the index ranges between 0 and 100%.
                 Avalue of zero shows that there is no connection between nodes (null). This rarely occurs in
                networks.
                 Anindexabove zero and below 100% indicates a minimally connected network.
                A value of 100% indicates a maximum number of connections, with direct links between
                all the nodes. Thus a network with high connectivity
                Example 1
                V
                E
                From this diagram the gamma index can be calculated thus
                4. The Cyclomatic Number (C): This index is used mainly to analyse or measure the number
                of circuits in a network. The more the number of edges (links) in a network, the greater the
                number of circuits are likely to be. It is expressed as follows;
                Example: The tree graph below can be used to calculate the number
                V
                E
                Generally, a low value of the cyclomatic number as 0 in this example indicates that it is a
                minimally connected network and has no circuit. Such a network can only have a circuit if one
                edge is added to it like in the tree graph or network in example 1 above.
                5. The Detour Index (DI): This index is aimed at analyzing and comparing the theoretical
                straight-line routes between places in topological maps with the actual route. Generally,
                when using topological maps, the edges that link the vertices are drawn as straight lines.
                These straight lines are known as Desire Lines. In transport studies, a desire line is a straight
                line joining two places between which people or goods travel. In reality route networks
                hardly follow the most straight lines. This is because obstacles such as valleys, large rivers
                mountains, etc may limit the straight link of routes, and thus detours take place making the
                distances longer but safe, detours are therefore made to avoid obstacles which would be
                difficult and costly to overcome. The following formula is used to calculate this:
                The lowest possible index is 1.00. A detour index or 2.00 means that the actual route is twice as
                long as the most direct route. When expressed as a percentage, the formula is multiplied by 100.
                The higher the number above 100, the greater the detours. Generally the higher the index, the
                greater the detour and the lower the index, the lesser the detour.
                6. Measurement of the centrality of a place (Nodes): The centrality of a network measures
                the ease of access to a place and this can be derived from the Accessibility Matrix, The
                centrality of a node or location therefore depends on the accessibility of that location. The
                more accessible a place is, the more central it is and vice versa. The following indices can be
                used to measure the centrality of a node and thus network accessibility.
                i.
                The Konig Number (Assocaited Number): This was developed by Konig in 1939 and the
                measure became known as Konig Number. This can be used to find the centrality of any
                node. This describes the maximum number of links by the shortest path from each or one
                node to the other nodes in the network. It is thus a topological measure of distance, in edges
                or links rather than in kilometres. The lower the konig number, the greater the centrality of
                that node and a high degree of connectivity. Nodes with a high konig number indicate less
                centrality and low connectivity.
                ii. Shimbel-Katz Number or Index: This is calculated as the sum of the links by the shortest
                path from a node to the other nodes in the network. It provides the measure of the centrality
                and accessibility of any node. The smaller the number, the greater the centrality and the
                higher the number, the lower the centrality. It therefore indicate that the node (or nodes) in a
                network with lowest Shimbel number has the highest centrality and it is the most accessible
                and those with high numbers have low centrality and are inaccessible. This number can be
                obtained after the construction of a network or accessibility matrix.
                Accessibility of a Network
                Accessibility is the ease of approach to one location from other locations. In other words, it
                refers to the ease with which people can reach a place from another. Accessibility varies from
                place to place and can be measured in terms of distance traveled or the time taken. The
                accessibility of a place can be calculated or measured or summarized by using a framework
                known as Accessibility Matrix, which is derived from a topological map made up of vertices and
                edges.
                Topological Maps and how to construct an accessibility Matrix
                A topological map is a map designed to show only a selected feature like transport networks.
                Locations on such maps are shown as dots with straight lines connecting them with no indication
                of distance. Thus networks which have been simplified as maps with such straight lines linking
                locations are called topological maps. These locations are known as nodes (vertices) while the
                straight lines are links or edges. Hence to draw a topological map means linking one node
                (location) to the others in a network.
                The construction of a network matrix is an alternative method of analyzing transport
                flows given that line maps at times are difficult to interpret. Matrices are therefore rectangular
                array of numbers arranged in columns and rows, any one entry of which is known as an element.
                Each column and row refers to a point in the study area, places a, b, c,…etc for instance being
                listed in the same order along the rows as down the columns. The actual volume of flow between
                each pair of places is then entered in the appropriate cell of the matrix, or the actual number of
                links using the shortest path from one node to the other is recorded in the appropriate cell of the
                matrix. Here, care must be taken to count the links using the shortest path. The aim is to follow a
                route between two places passing through a few vertices as possible since they can cause
                congestion and delay e.g. on the figure below, to move from Kumba to Yabassi involves three
                links. If the actual flow units from Kumba to Yabassi are known, then it should be recorded in
                the same way as the links are recorded in the matrix.
                If the matrix shows actual flow, the total amount of flow from one place to all other
                places is known as the out-degree of the point and it is indicated by the sum of the elements in
                the appropriate row; similarly the total flow into one place from all other places is known as the
                in-degree of the point and it is indicated by the sum of the elements in the appropriate column.
                The out-degree and in-degree constitutes what is known as Gross Accessibility Index (G.A.I).
                This is found by adding up the individual accessibility indices. This therefore means that when a
                matrix has been constructed, the sum of the out-degree (calculated horizontally before adding)
                and that of the in-degree (calculated vertically downwards) must be given the same G.A.I. To
                find this index for a place therefore, add up the number of the links that a person must travel over
                to reach each of the other places in the network. A complete matrix does this for the places in the
                network.
                Example 1: The accessibility matrix can be constructed from the topological map below by the
                shortest route possible.

                The matrix shows the ease or difficulty of accessibility to each node. The Gross Accessibility
                Index (i.e. the total out-degree and in-degree) is 107. This is found by adding up the individual
                indices. The accessibility of a node or location is determined by the extent to which it is
                connected by a number of edges (routes). There are some nodes in the network that are more
                accessible than others. The node with the lowest accessibility index is the most accessible or
                most connected and from the topological map, the most accessible node is 8 with an accessibility
                index of 11on the accessibility matrix.
                Advantages of Accessibility Matrix--
                It helps to easily determine which location or settlement in a network is well connected or
                least connected.
                Indicates regional inequalities in transport development which some regions are more
                developed than others.
                Helps government in her transport planning policies i.e. where more route should be
                constructed and what to do to avoid congestion in certain parts of the country.
                It may indicate transport problems in a society.
                Disadvantages of the Accessibility Matrix----
                The accessibility index is a crude measure because accessibility is not only affected by the
                number of links between places but other socio-economic conditions.
                A place which is quicker and or cheaper to reach, usually because the distance is less is said
                to be more accessible than just the number of edges that connect it.
                An individual’s perception of distance, journey time and cost may be wrong, so they do not
                visit the most accessible place to obtain what they require.
                Distance between places can be measured in a number of ways i.e. in kilometres, metres or
                centimeter for linear distance; the time that the journey takes for time distance; and the cost
                of the journey which is related to distance and time for cost distance.
                Example 2: The diagram below illustrates the topological map of part of the coastal region of
                Cameroon and from it the accessibility matrix can be constructed.

                This accessibility matrix shows the shortest routes between pairs of nodes (by number of links).
                The Gross Accessibility Index is 140 and from the table, the centrality and accessibility of places
                can be known.
                 Using the konig number, the best-connected node is Douala with a low konig number of 2
                and the least connected are Limbe and Njombe given their highest konig number of 4.
                 Also, using the Shimbel-Katz number, the best connected node is Douala with a low shimbel
                index of 12 and closely followed by Mbanga (13) while the least connected is Limbe (19) and
                closely followed by Njombe (18).
                 Using these two indices (konig and shimbel) of centrality and accessibility, the node with the
                greatest accessibility and centrality is Douala while the most inaccessible and with the least
                centrality are Limbe and Njombe given their high index numbers.
                Advantages of topological maps--
                They allow for easy comparison
                The statistics are quite straight forward
                They simplify complex patterns.
                Disadvantages/weaknesses of topological
                --
                In representing network patterns, they mostly use straight lines to link locations but in reality
                route networks rarely follow such direct routes given the physical and human obstacles.
                Topological maps do not take into consideration the price, time, environmental impact and
                social cost but these are important aspects included in transport.
                b. Types of route connectivity
                 Builder Cost: This is the cost incurred by companies, regions or countries in providing and
                maintaining a surface or track over which the transport service can operate. The builder may
                either incur a high or low cost in the provision of this track. Generally, the least-cost network
                to the builder is likely to be the one with the shortest overall length. This is because route
                builders try to minimize costs as much as possible. Where the length of the route is very long
                and winding, builder cost are high. Such networks do not have many linkages and in most
                cases, in networks where the builder costs are low, the user costs are usually high and vice
                versa. The diagrams below show routes where builder costs are minimized.

                Figure: Minimised Builder Cost-Here there are more nodes than links
                E
                The above networks are likely to be found in areas with a sparse population and low traffic
                density (Australia), in highland areas where routes are funneled along valley floors or where
                the construction cost per unit length is extremely high as in the case of motorways. Examples
                of networks that demonstrate least cost to builders may include the Paul Reverse, Centre
                oriented or the Tree graph. Such networks are minimally connected.
                 UserCost: These are costs incurred by the user of any mode of transport or cost incurred as a
                result of movement in a transport system. These costs will largely depend on the distance
                travelled and the number of journeys which take place. Users always strive to minimize
                distance when moving between nodes so as to also cut down on cost.
                The least cost network to the user is the one where the traveller can move as quickly and
                directly as possible between any points in the network. This is the case where nodes are
                interlinked as in the circuit network pattern.

                E
                D
                Here there are more links than nodes making it easy and cheaper to use given that it is possible to
                take the shortest distance from one node to the other. it is worth noting that where the user cost is
                low, the builder cost is high. Examples of such networks are likely to occur in conurbations
                where high population and traffic densities demand numerous alternative routes. The complete
                graph or circuit network illustrates this type of route.
                c. Network Deviation
                When we observe the actual location of routes, it will be seen that with very few exceptions, all
                routes between centres follow a more or less complex path which deviates at least slightest from
                the geometric straight-line solution. Quite often, they deviate and run between the settlements by
                apparently circuitous routes. For each type of transport system constructed depends on its
                primary purpose as the departure from the geometric straight-line route therefore means that
                there are a lot of distortions and deviations in route network even in complete networks.
                Deviations may be positive or negative as follows:
                 Positive Deviations: This is when routes are diverted to gain or collect more traffic (freight
                and passengers) from other centres. In this case the length of the route is increased but more
                profits are made. The manner in which positive deviation is illustrated on the following
                diagram A, B and C.
                A A
                B
                B A
                C A
                Figure: Positive Route Deviations
                Sources: Adapted from Charles Whynne H, 1985, P.150
                From the diagrams, the following analyses can be made
                B
                B
                A=represents the shortest or minimum length route. This route illustrates that routes designed
                to join two centres may ignore any settlement in between because these have little importance for
                the type of trade envisaged (as with railways and motorways). It shows the least cost route-with
                the cheapest transport cost but this brings in limited traffic since the intermediate smaller centres
                lying between the general line of the route connecting A and B are not served and as such
                revenues are low (little or no profit may be made). This straight-line route has the shortest
                distance, cheapest to build and it is the most expensive to the user.
                B= shows the Maximum traffic route. Here there are connections with the intervening smaller
                centres (as with minor roads) and therefore makes it the route with the longest distance but
                highly profitable. The aim is to maximize the traffic (as with bus services). It is the most
                expensive to build but it provide the least cost to the user.
                C=Illustrates a compromise or optimum route. This is economically the best route given that
                such routes are designed both to minimize journey length between major centres and to
                maximize traffic. This is achieved by connecting major centres with a route that sweeps as near
                as possible to all minor ones. Many railway networks have been designed on this principle.
                These routes are intended for definite economic or social reasons that are either to increase
                revenue or to serve a community. Generally, to maximize profits, a builder or user of transport
                must minimize costs and maximize revenue.
                 Negative Deviations: These result from routes being diverted to avoid physical and human
                obstacles. Physical obstacles may include a mountain range, spur, river, lake, valley etc while
                human obstacles may include settlements, tourist sites, etc. The avoidance of these obstacles
                is often necessary to reduce the cost of route construction and use. Two situations can be
                used to show how negative deviation may develop.
                (i)
                The first case is where a route between two settlements A and B has to cross a mountain
                range. Here the “Laws of refraction” or the “Refraction Principle” is applied where the
                route refracts or changes direction to avoid the obstacle. This may be illustrated in the
                figure below:
                The three situations are explained below
                A= The shortest route (high builder cost but lower user cost). This shows a route that is built to
                connect two points (or centres) on either side of the mountain. Although it is the shortest path
                across the mountain, it involves very high building cost because of the need for cutting
                embankments and tunnels. Such a route can only be profitable when the volume of traffic is high
                leading to high returns as it is the cases of the M62 connecting Leeds with Manchester across the
                Pennines and the Grand St. Bernard tunnel in the Alps connecting Italy with Switzerland.
                Generally such routes are expensive to build but cheaper to use.
                B= The longest route (low builder cost and higher to user). This alternative strategy is aimed at
                avoiding the mountain altogether and choosing a low land route of least cost to builder per
                kilometer. Such a route will have great length and few benefits to user, thus it would be
                expensive to the user. Most minor roads in upland areas are cheaper to build or construct but
                expensive to use.
                C= Compromise (or optimum) route. This third alternative is the most realistic because the
                two factors of construction costs and running costs are taken into consideration, that is the
                builder and user costs are considered before constructing the route. Generally, for many major
                links, a compromise is adopted, balancing the higher construction costs of a short mountain
                section against the savings of a shorter journey.
                (ii)
                The second illustration of negative deviation is where there is an effort to minimize
                distance travelled thorough high cost areas. assuming that there are two points A and B
                separated by land and sea over which a route runs, the main problem would be to find a
                route by which a product can be transported as cheaply as possible from site A to b and to
                locate a port along the coastline. It is assumed that everywhere along the coastline is
                favourable for port construction.
                From the diagram above, if land and water transport cost the same per unit of cargo, movement
                between A and B would be cheapest in a straight line and ports would be built at P1. But we
                know that actually the cost of land transport is not the same as water transport and we therefore
                assume cheap ocean freight and more costly land freight.
                d. Factors influencing the Degree of connectivity of Networks
                1. Physical factors: The nature of the physical environment plays an important role in transport
                network development. This can greatly affect the level of connectivity in the sense that if the
                terrain is good or favourable, that is level, undulating and well drain, free of large rivers,
                swamps and dense forest, the level or degree of connectivity will be high since more roads
                can be constructed easily and at a lower cost. On the other hand if physical conditions are
                unfavourable, like the presence of rugged topography, deep valleys, poorly drained areas
                with swamps and large rivers, dense forest, etc network connectivity would be low given the
                difficulty of construction and the high cost involved.
                2. The shape of the region: Regions with small width and expanded length impose limits to
                connectivity because the construction of new links and occurrence of nodes is restricted.
                Broad width and lengthy areas favours greater connectivity.
                3. The size of the region: Connectivity is generally lower in small countries and higher in large
                regions. Since greater connectivity goes with the construction of many routes, it is likely to
                remain limited in regions with small sizes. Also fewer routes are needed to serve such areas.
                4. Population and population density: Population creates the need for more routes. Where
                population number is large and densities are high the volume of flow and interaction is high.
                This requires a greater number of routes to satisfy the needs of the people. Because of this
                network, connectivity will be high given that the rentability of network development here is
                assured. But in sparsely populated areas with low densities the level of network connectivity
                is low. This because interaction is low and thus, the construction of many routes will be
                unpopulated given that there are few people to use them.
                5. The level of economic development: High level of economic development creates the
                demand for more routes as people become more mobile. Also more goods and services are
                usually in circulation. It also implies greater exploitation of the resources of the region like
                mineral, agriculture, forest, etc. Thus the higher the level of economic development, the
                higher the need for highly connected networks to contain the large volume of traffic.
                6. Level of technological advancement: In regions with high level of technology, the degree of
                connectivity would be high but where technology is low, the level of connectivity is also low.
                High technological advancement results in high connectivity because it is easy to overcome
                environmental obstacles like deep valleys, rugged topography, swamps, large rivers and
                construct more routes.
                7. Political factor: The government policy of decentralization of administrative services, socio
                economic and political activities often encourages high network connectivity since this
                cannot go without route development.
                8. Per capita income: In regions where the per capita income is high, network connectivity will
                be high because this high per capita income has made many modes of transport to easily find
                a threshold demand as the desire to travel increases directly with an increase in per capita
                income. With high per capita income, the rentability of networks is assured and thus, more
                would be constructed. On the other hand, where per capita income is low, connectivity would
                be low given that few people have the desire to displace.
                9. Foreign exchange earnings: An increase in this may be through the exportation of
                commodities or through revenue from foreign investments. This helps to increase the
                currency reserve of the country and thus facilitates the construction of more routes leading to
                high network connectivity. But if a country earns little or no foreign currency may be
                because of poor international market conditions like a fall in prices of products, capital for
                investment would be limited and as such network connectivity would be low.
                10. Historical factor: This has also contributed to transport network development and thus high
                connectivity in many countries especially developing ones. For instance in most developing
                countries during the period of colonization links were created between these countries and
                the developed nations (colonial masters). When the colonial masters landed at the coast of
                these developing countries, they developed transport infrastructures inland and around the
                coast which facilitated the exploitation of the resources of the hinterland and the exportation
                of these resources to their home countries as raw materials. This led to an increase in network
                connectivity in the countries concerned.

                A. TheTaffee, Morill and Gould Model
                Taffee, Mouril and Gould were the first to propose a simplified model to illustrates how
                networks develop. This model explains how and why communication or transport network
                change over time due to economic development. It should be noted that the longer the period
                over which a network has developed the more like it is to be dense, highly connected and
                multimodal. This trend in network development is based on studies conducted in West Africa
                (notable Nigeria and Ghana). According to the studies it was shown that transport network
                develop in stages or phases and six of those phases were identified.
                B. Stages of the model
                a. Stage 1: Scattered or Isolated Small Ports: This stage characterizes the early contact
                between colonizers and the colonized, a series of trading ports and settlements have been
                created. They are of the same size, scattered from each other and having no links between
                them. However there are a few tracks leading inland from the ports. Each port therefore has
                its small hinterland with which it interacts. Because of the very little inter connection
                between the ports and their hinterlands, there is also limited exploitation of these hinterlands.
                The little inter connection may be because of; the reliance upon local sea borne trade with
                tracks leading inland, port development was limited by shallow seas, few natural inlets and
                deltas at river mouths, colonizers were still carrying out feasibility studies.
                b. Stage 2: Penetration lines and port connections: This stage occurs when two of these ports
                grow (P1P2) and develop links with two interior settlements (S1S2). Early colonial
                development included routes inland, usually roads and railways to these newly developed
                settlements or towns. this is because with time, the desire to exploit the natural resources of
                the area gradually caused further penetration inland to link up the best located of the coastal
                ports to mining, agriculture and population centres so far identified. These resources were
                exported to the colonial power through the ports developed.
                c. Stage 3: Development of feeder routes: At this stage, the two major ports enlarge their
                hinterlands at the expense of the smaller ports. Thus as time goes on the interior dynamic
                centre of the major ports start developing into important big centres. Their importance is
                directly attributed to the export products they produce and their accessibility to the coast.
                Generally, intermediate secondary centres develop along the principal routes as seen on the
                diagram above. They develop either along those lining the major sea port or other dynamic
                interior centres. The desire to completely have the hinterlands of the interior centres well
                exploited have led to the development of other side routes from these centres to their own
                respective hinterlands and with time, these centres will finally become route junctions. At
                this stage, there is a decline of less favoured port settlements.
                d. Stage 4: Interconnections begin: At this stage the intervening nodes develop their own
                hinterlands N1N2 and some of the large feeder routes begin to link up i.e. S1S2. This is the
                stage where real transport development starts.
                e. Stage 5: Complete Interconnection: This stage develops when the economy becomes more
                integrated, such that all the principal economic and population centres are well
                interconnected. This stage shows a dense network of routes and thus, high network
                connectivity. From this point, economic activity is at its peak.
                f.
                Stage 6: Growth of High Priority main streets: The development of the network is
                complete at this stage with the emergence of some main streets. These are national trunk
                routes (e.g. linking S2 and P1, then P1 and P2). Most settlements now interconnect and major
                centres are connected by all-weather roads and rail. At this stage, network connectivity is
                very high leading to an increase in passenger traffic as opposed to the early stages when
                goods dominated traffic.
                Applicability of the Model
                 Themodel has since been applied to other developing countries especially in South America,
                parts of Africa, Asia and Malaysia. In many cases, only stage 2 has been reached mainly
                because following interdependence, these countries had insufficient money to improve and
                modernize their networks beyond the main urban centres, except perhaps, to a prestigious
                airport. To reach the highest stages 5 and 6 (Brazil and Malaysia) it appears that a country
                needs the development of a manufacturing industry and the emergence of an affluent sector
                in the population.
                Weaknesses of the model
                 The model emphasizes the fact that transport network development started in Africa only
                during colonization but this is not true because history tells us that prior to colonization, there
                existed powerful empires in Africa and very strong trade relations existed between them.
                 It indicates a smooth evolution of transport network development without taking into
                consideration the role played by physical and human factors in hindering transport
                development. These could slow down development at a certain stage.
                 The model does not apply to landlocked countries since it emphasizes that transport
                development started from the coast.
                 Many countries in the developing world have not passed through these stages as prescribed
                by the model given the problems plaguing transport development in these areas.

                TOURISM
                A. Meaning
                Tourism is one of the world’s fastest-growing industries and a major foreign exchange and
                employment generation for many countries. It is one of the most remarkable economic and social
                phenomena. The world “tour” is derived from the Latin word “ tornus” which means “a tool for
                making a circle”. Thus tourism may be defined as the movement of people from their normal
                place of residence to another with the intention to return, for a minimum period of twenty four
                hours to a maximum of six months for the sole purpose of leisure and pleasure. According to
                WTO (World Tourism Organisation, 1993), tourism encompasses the activities of persons
                traveling and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive
                year for leisure, business and other purposes.
                B. Nature of tourism movements
                a. Types of tourism
                1. Recreational: Recreation or leisure tourism takes a person away from the humdrum of
                everyday life. In this case, people spend their leisure time at the hills, sea beaches, etc.
                2. Cultural tourism: Cultural tourism satisfies cultural and intellectual curiosity and involves
                visits to ancient monuments, places of historical or religious importance etc.
                3. Sport/adventure: Trips undertaken by people with a view to playing golf, skiing and hiking,
                fall within this category.
                4. Health tourism: Under this category, people travel for medical, treatment or visit places
                where there are curative possibilities, for example hot springs, spa yoga, etc.
                5. Convention tourism: It is becoming an increasingly important component of travel. People
                travel within a country or overseas to attend conventions relating to their business, profession
                or interest.
                6. Incentive tourism: Holiday trips are offered as incentives by major companies to dealers and
                salesmen who achieve high targets in sales. This is a new and expanding phenomenon in
                tourism.
                7. Mass Tourism: It is a form of tourism that involves tens of thousands of people going to the
                same resort often at the same time of the year. It is the most popular form of tourism as it is
                often the cheapest way to holiday and is often sold as a package deal.
                8. Eco tourism: Also known as ‘green tourism’ is a sustainable form of tourism that is more
                appropriate to developing countries than the mass tourism associated with Florida and certain
                Mediterranean areas. Ecotourism involves visiting places in order to appreciate the natural
                environment, ecosystems scenery and wildlife, and to understand their culture. It also
                involves creating economic opportunities (jobs) in an area while at the same time protecting
                natural resources (scenery and wildlife) and the local way of life.
                C. Major global tourists origins and destinations
                The World Tourism rankings are compiled by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation
                as part of their World Tourism Barometer publication, which is released up to six times per year.
                In the publication, UN regions and sub regions are ranked by the number of international visitor
                arrivals, by the revenue generated by inbound tourism and by the expenditures of outbound
                travelers. In 2019 there were 1.459 billion international tourist arrivals worldwide with a growth
                rate of 3.7% as compared to 2018. The top 10 international tourism destinations in 2019 were:
                France (89.4 million), Spain (83.5million), United States (79.3milllion), China (65.7million), Italy
                (64.5million), Turkey (51.2million), Mexico (45.0million), Thailand (39.8million), Germany
                (39.6million), and United Kingdom (39.4milllion).
                The origins of world tourist are shared in the following order: Germany, USA, UK, France,
                China and Italy.
                D. Tourist Resources and Facilities
                a. Tourist resources: Tourism has a variety of potentials or attractions. These ranges from
                natural scenery to cultural. They include:------------
                Snowy mountains
                Glaciers
                Dense forest
                Lakes and plains
                Rivers and waterfalls
                Caves
                Cultural heritage
                Traditional dances
                National Parks
                Game reserves
                Cultural villages

                b. Tourist facilities: They include
                Hotels
                Restaurants----------------------
                Efficient transport systems
                Various modes of transport
                E. Impacts of Tourism
                a. Economic
                Positive
                Increases gross domestic product directly and indirectly through the multiplier effect
                Taxes on tourism increases government revenue
                Increased foreign exchange earnings
                Foreign investment
                Creates employment opportunities including unskilled occupations; labour-incentive.
                Helps fund new infrastructure i.e. roads, airports and facilities which local people can also
                use.
                Stimulates and diversifies economic activity in other sectors such as local craft revival,
                manufacturers, services and agriculture.
                May act as seedbed for entrepreneurship, with spin-offs into other sectors.
                Improves balance of payments through increased trade.
                Negative
                May divert government expenditure from other needy areas of the economy.
                Requires government expenditure on tourism
                Over-dependence on outside agencies and some external control on the economy
                Overstretches infrastructures
                Income reduced by external leakages or outflow e.g. imported food for tourists.
                Profits may go overseas.
                Spread effects limited and may therefore increase regional inequalities between tourist
                growth areas and less developed periphery.
                Diverts labour and resources away from non-tourist regions and may affect peripheral areas,
                leading to out-migration to tourist resort opportunities.
                Labour is unskilled and seasonal
                Foreign personnel and firms dominate managerial and higher paid posts, reducing
                opportunities for local people.
                b. Social
                Positive----------------
                Cultural exchange stimulated with broadening of horizons and reduction of prejudices
                amongst tourist visitors and host populations
                May enhance role and status of women in society as opportunity for goals in tourism is
                created and outlook widened.
                Encourages education
                Encourages travel, mobility and social integration
                Improves services (electricity and health), transport and widens range of shops and leisure
                amenities.
                Negative
                May cause polarization between population in advancing tourist regions and less developed
                areas, creating a ‘dual society’.
                Increases rift between ‘rich’ and ‘poor’
                Breakdown of traditional family values creates material aspirations.
                Breakdown of families due to stress between younger generation, who are affected by
                imported culture, and older members of household called the negative demonstration effect.
                Social pathology, including an increase in prostitution, drugs and petty crime.
                Increases health risk e.g. AIDS.
                c. Cultural
                Positive
                May save aspects of indigenous culture due to tourist interest in them
                Contact with other cultures may enrich domestic culture through new ideas and customs
                being introduced.
                Encourages contact and harmonious relations between people of different cultures.
                Increases international understanding.
                Negative
                Impact of commercialization may lead to pseudo-cultural activities to entertain tourists and at
                extreme, may cause disappearance or dilution of indigenous culture, a phenomenon known as
                ‘commodification’
                Mass tourism may create antagonism from host population who are concerned for traditional
                values e.g. dress, religion.----------
                Westernization of culture, food and drinks.
                d. Environmental
                Positive
                Improved landscaping and architectural standards in resort areas, including increased local
                funding for improvement of local housing, etc.
                Promotes interest in monuments and historic buildings and encourages funding to conserve
                and maintain them.
                May induce tighter environmental legislation to protect environment i.e. landscape, heritage
                sites, wildlife
                Establishment of nature reserves and national parks; growing tourist interest and awareness
                protect areas from economic and building encroachment.
                Poor building and infrastructure development-tourist complexes do not integrate with local
                architecture.
                Negative
                Destruction of natural environment and wildlife habitat like marine, coastal and inland
                Excessive pressure leads to air, land, noise, visual and water pollution, and breakdown I
                water supplies, etc.
                Traffic congestion and pollution.
                Clearance of natural vegetation, loss of ecosystems.
                F. Evolution and Growth of world tourism
                The Romans must rank amongst the earliest tourists, as many of their most wealthy families used
                to move to their country villas during the hot, dry summers. By the 18th and 19th centuries,
                affluent British people were either visiting spa towns within England or making the ‘Grand Tour’
                of classical Europe, while the less well-off were beginning to popularize local seaside resorts.
                Today tourism has become part of everyday life and a major source of employment in many
                developed countries. Here, the rapid growth of the tourist industry in the last half-century can be
                linked to numerous factors such as greater affluence (wealth), increased mobility, improvements
                in accessibility and transport, more leisure time, etc.
                In 2008, the travel and tourism industry accounted for 8.4 per cent (238 million) of the world’s
                total employment and contributed 9.9 per cent of its GDP. Of total tourist receipts, 71 per cent
                was earned by countries in North America and Europe, although this only gave them a very
                small travel account surplus. In contrast, the travel account balance for developing countries has
                shown a persistently high, and widening surplus (unlike their trade balance), mainly because they
                are visited by wealthy tourists from developed countries whereas few of their residents can
                afford holidays in developed countries. This evolution and growth in global tourism is as seen
                below.
                Figure: Growth in global tourism from 1960– 2020
                Source: David Waugh, 2009. P. 588
                Factors for the growth of global tourism
                a. Greater affluence: People in employment earn high salaries and their disponsable income is
                much greater than it was several decades ago. Again, people in full time employment also
                receive holiday with pay, allowing them to take more than one holiday a year and to travel
                further.
                b. Greater mobility: The increase in car ownership has given people greater freedom to choose
                where and when they go for a day or for a longer period. In 1951, only 1 UK family in 20 had
                a car. By 2008, 75 per cent had at least one car. Also, chartered aircraft have reduced the costs
                of overseas travel; wide-bodied jets can carry more people and can travel further bringing
                economies of scale.
                c. Improved accessibility and transport facilities: Improvement in roads, especially
                motorways and urban by-passes, have reduced driving times between places and encourage
                people to travel more frequently and greater distances. Improved and enlarged international
                airports reduced air fares and increased package holidays.
                d. More leisure time: Shorter working week and longer paid holidays, flexi time with more
                people working from home and more firms employing part time workers; the presence of an
                ageing population many of them who are still active all accounts for the growth of tourism.
                e. Technological developments: Jet aircraft, computerized reservation systems, use of the
                internet have all increase tourism.
                f.
                Product development and innovation: Holiday and beach villas, long-haul destinations,
                package hours, etc.
                g. Changing lifestyles: People are retiring early and are able to take advantage of their greater
                fitness. People at work need longer/more frequent rest periods as pressure of work seems to
                increase. Again, changing fashions e.g. health resorts, fitness holidays, winter sun, etc.
                h. Changing recreational activities: Slight decline in the ‘beach holiday’ partly due to the
                threat of skin cancer, increase in active holidays (skiing, water sports) and in self-catering as
                well as important theme parks and large number of city breaks has encouraged tourism.
                i.
                Advertising and TV programmes: Holiday programmes, film and TV sets, magazines and
                brochures promote new and different places and activities. The need to benefit local economy,
                environment and people without spoiling the attractiveness and amenities of the places
                visited (ecotourism) has promoted the growth of world tourism.
                Tourism Evolution Model of Butler
                Also known as the Tourism Life cycle model, was a model proposed by Butler in an attempt to
                examine the various stages through which a tourist resort passes through. Butler proposed that
                most tourist resorts go through a six stage model and he called this the tourism cycle model. This
                model states that “most tourist resorts start on a very small scale and get bigger and bigger until
                stagnation occurs”. Within the 6 stages the following occurs
                1. Exploration: A few hardy and adventurous people looking for something different in a
                holiday find a place that is special in terms of its culture, natural beauty, history or landscape.
                There are may be no tourist services available and local people will not be involved in tourist
                money making activities at this stage.
                2. Involvement: Local people start to notice that there are increasing numbers of people
                coming to their local area. They start businesses to provide accommodation, food, guides and
                transport.
                3. Development: Big companies start to see the emerging potential of the area as a tourist resort
                and therefore start to invest money in the region. They build large hotel complexes and sell
                package holidays (a package might include travel, accommodation, food and ecotourism).
                This makes the numbers of tourists swell dramatically and massively expands the number of
                job opportunities for people in the area, in both tourist related jobs and in construction and
                services.
                4. Consolidation: At this stage the local economy is probably dominated by tourism and many
                local people will make their money from this type of industry. However, this can remove
                people from other industries such as farming and fishing and these industries can suffer as a
                result. There will be continued building and expansion of the resort but some of the older
                buildings will start to become unattractive and a lower quality client base might result.
                5. Stagnation: Competition from other resorts, rowdiness and a loss of the original features e.g.
                if it had a great beach but that is now crowded and full of rubbish can cause the resort to stop
                growing. The number of people going levels off then starts to decline, threatening local
                businesses and services.
                6. Decline or rejuvenation: From the stagnation point onwards there are 2 basic possibilities;
                Decline in various forms or rejuvenation (regrowth of the resort). Decline can be slow or
                rapid, and regular visitors are replaced by people seeking a cheap break or day trippers.
                Rejuvenation involves a cash injection from either a private company or government, to
                create new attraction within the original resort to boost its popularity such as the pleasure
                Beach at Blackpool. All these stages are summarized in the diagram below:

                HYDROLOGY 
            TOPIC: GLOBAL WATER IN STORAGE AND CIRCULATION 
            Lesson 1: Introduction to Hydrology 
            I. Meaning and scope of Hydrology  
            Hydrology is the study of the distribution, movement and quality of water both on the surface 
            of the earth and underground. This embodies among others, the scientific study of rivers called 
            potamology; the study of fresh water lakes and ponds called limnology, and the study of snow 
            and ice known as cryology. 
            Hydrologists apply scientific knowledge to solve water-related problems in society such as 
            problems of quantity, quality and availability. They are involved in the provision of drinking 
            water, irrigation, construction of dams and bridges, production and control of floods and 
            droughts. The focus of hydrology is the hydrological cycle.  
            II. Distribution of world’s water resources  
            Earth is essentially covered by water. It is the only place in the universe, as far as we know, 
            where liquid water exists in substantial quantities. 
            Water occupies about 71% of the total surface area of the earth, while land covers only 29%. 
            Much of this water is saline, while fresh water needed by man for various purposes occupies a 
            very insignificant proportion. 
            The world’s total water supply is about 332.5 million cubic miles of water. Of this, over 96% is 
            saline.  
            Global water storage or reservoirs 
            Water reservoirs Values (Km3 x 103)) Percentage of total water 
            Ocean 1350000 97.403 
            Ice caps/glaciers 27500 1.984 
            Groundwater 8200 0.592 
            Atmosphere 13 0.00094 
            Rivers (channel storage) 1.7 0.00012 
            Surface store (lakes, inland 
            seas)

            1.1 0.00008 
            Soil moisture 70 0.0051 
                        As observed on the table above, world’s water is generally distributed as follows; 
             Oceans and seas occupy the largest proportion representing about 97.4%. the water of 
            the ocean ad sea is saline (salty) 
             Ice caps and glaciers constitute the second largest store of water occupying about 
            1.98%. They represent the largest store of fresh water.  
             Underground water which is stored in permeable rocks below the surface, constitutes 
            the third largest store of water (0.59%). It is another source of fresh water. 
             Rivers and lakes, which are other sources of fresh water, only constitute about 0.32%.  
            Yet, rivers and lakes are the most sources of water people use every day. 
             Atmospheric moisture from where precipitation forms, represents only about 0.3% of 
            fresh water. 
             Soil moisture represents 0.5%. 
            III. 
            Main uses of water which is increasing  
            Water is a basic necessity for life. Interestingly, the demand for water resources is fast 
            increasing. It is an important resource that is used for various purposes by man. Some of these 
            uses are seen below  
            1. For agricultural improvement: Water has been exploited for agricultural development 
            through the building of small dams and digging of canals to irrigate dry lands.  
            2. For energy provision: some rivers have been dammed and exploited for HEP. These 
            include River Tennessee in USA, the Volta River in Ghana, the Niger at Kianji in Nigeria. 
            In Cameroon, the River Sanaga has been dammed at Edea and Songloulou I and II. The 
            completion of the Lom Pangar dam, the Memve’ele dam on the River Ntem, the Colomines 
            on the River Kadei upper Sangha, the Mekin on the Dja River, and the Biniwaka project in 
            he Adamawa region, would step up electricity production in Cameroon.  
            3. Water for fishing: Both inland and coastal waters are used for inland fisheries. World’s 
            major fisheries include off the coast of Peru, the Grand Banks, off the coast of N.E USA, 
            off the West Coast of North America, off the coast of Japan, China among others. 
            In Cameroon, coastal fisheries include the west coast between Rio del Rey and Limbe, Campo
            Kribi Coast, the Mounako-Bandangue in Sanaga Maritime Division, Wouri estuary and coastal 
            creeks and the deep sea off-shore.  
            Inland fisheries include  
             The various lakes inland such as Barombi, Bamendjim in the Ndop plain, Lagdo and Lake 
            Chad. 
             The various rivers in their lower courses such as the Rivers Logone, Chari, Nyong, Mid 
            Sanaga and Benue.  
            2 | P a g e 
            4. For transportation: Both coastal and inland waters are exploited for transportation. The 
            major oceans of the world like the Atlantic, Pacific and seas such as the Mditerranean, and 
            majo rivers such as the St. Lawrence Waterway USA, the Rhine River in Europe, the Niger 
            in Africa are means of ransporting heavy cargo across the world or in different regions. 
            In Cameroon, the River Sanaga is navigable for 60km from the Atlantic to Edea and for 85km 
            from Edea to the Nachtigal rapids mainly for the transportation of agricultural produce and 
            people in villages along it. The Dibamba is navigable for 60km and used for floating of logs. 
            The Sangha and Ngoko are used for floating of logs. In the Northern part, the Benue is used 
            seasonally for export of cotton to Nigeria from Garoua river port. It is navigable for a total of 
            1000km from the port of Burutu in Nigeria to Garoua. 
            5. For exploitation of building materials: such as sand from the River Sanaga, the 
            Menchum River in the North West. Dredging of sand is mostly done by individuals or 
            group or groups of persons and supplied by trucks to neighbouring consuming centres for 
            construction work.  For instance, sand from the Sanaga River is used for construction in 
            Yaounde and neighbouring settlements, that from the Mungo and Wouri for Douala, 
            Menchum for Bamenda and its environs.  
            6. For domestic uses: water is used for drinking, air conditioning, washing clothes, washing 
            dishes, flushing toilets and watering lawns and gardens.  
            Lesson 2: The Hydrological Cycle 
            I. 
            Meaning  
            The hydrological cycle is the continuous circulation of water from the earth’s surface and 
            ocean to the atmosphere and back to the land phase.  
            The water cycle is powered by solar energy. This movement involves changes in state: from 
            liquid, through gas (vapour) to solid and back to liquid. It also embodies changes in 
            geographical location as water is carried from one place to another and back.

            The hydrological cycle 
            Generally, water is evaporated from oceans, lakes and land surfaces. From there it is 
            transported over land areas, largely in the form of floating clouds. Over land, the condensed 
            water falls as precipitation and then move in a variety of ways, particularly through runoff in 
            the form of streams and rivers. It eventually finds its way back to the sea. 
            Some of the condensed water falls directly into the oceans. This cycle is summarised in the 
            Bible; Ecclesiastes 1:7: “All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place 
            from whence the rivers come, thither they return again”. 
            II. The global hydrological cycle as a closed system 
            The hydrological cycle can be considered at different scales. At a global scale, it operates as a 
            closed system but at a drainage basin scale, it functions as an open system.

            Components and linkages in the water cycle 
            The hydrological cycle at a global scale is a closed system because apart from solar energy that 
            comes beyond the earth’s limits, there are no gains and losses of water in the overall cycle. No 
            water comes in from other planets or leaves the earth to other planets. 
            All the water in the cycle we are talking about is on the earth or in its atmosphere. Thus, there 
            are no inputs and outputs of water. As seen on the diagram above, the hydrological cycle is 
            made up of components and linkages or processes 
            A. Components of the Hydrological Cycle  
            The components are the various water storages which serve as sources of water. These include 
            the oceans and seas; surface water storages such as rivers and lakes; underground water, soil 
            moisture, atmospheric moisture and water locked up in the solid state as ice caps and glaciers.  
            The water humans exploit for various purposes, whether from wells (ground water), from 
            streams/rivers, from the sea is part of the hydrological system. The portion of the earth 
            occupied by water is known as the hydrosphere. That which is occupied by water in the solid 
            form (ice sheets and glaciers) is referred to as the cryosphere.  
            B. Processes in the Hydrological Cycle 
            The components or storages are connected to form a functional whole or system by linkages. 
            These are also referred to as processes or flows. At a global scale, these include 
            evapotranspiration, precipitation, stemflow and throughfall, runoff, infiltration, throughflow, 
            percolation, baseflow and channel runoff or stream flow. 
             Evapotranspiration:  It is a composite term for the combined loss of water from the 
            surface and from plants in the form of water vapour to the atmosphere. It embodies 
            evaporation and transpiration.    Evaporation is the direct loss of water from the surface and 
            from water bodies, while transpiration is the loss of water to the atmosphere as vapour by 
            plants through the stomata or tiny pore spaces on leaves. 
             Precipitation: it occurs when the water vapour that rises to the atmosphere condenses. This 
            forms clouds. The water droplets in the clouds may grow large and eventually fall back to 
            the surface as precipitation. This may occur in the form of rain, drizzle, sleet or snow.  
             Stemflow: It is the movement of water that has been intercepted by plants through  the 
            branches and trunks to the ground. The dripping of water to the surface from plant leaves 
            and branches is called throughfall.  
             Surface runoff or overland flow: This is the process by which some of the precipitated 
            water flows on the earth’s surface to nearby streams or rivers. This links surface storage to 
            channel storage.  
             Infiltration: It is process by which some of the precipitated water sinks or enters the soil. It 
            links surface storage with soil moisture.  
             Through flow: It is process by which of the water that enters the soil flows horizontally 
            through natural pipes in the soil downslope to the channel. It links soil moisture to channel 
            storage. 
            6 | P a g e 
             Percolation: It is the process by which some of the water that has entered the soil 
            continuous to flow vertically through joints and cracks of rocks to ground water store 
            below. It links soil moisture to ground water.  
             Baseflow: It is the flow of water from ground water store to the river channel. This occurs 
            as springs.  
             Channel flow: It is another form of runoff by which the water in the river valley flows and 
            empties itself into the sea or lake. This will evaporate again and the cycle continuous. 
            Evaporation occurs at all stages of the cycle.  
            Lesson 3: The Drainage Basin Hydrological Cycle as an Open System 
            I. 
            Concept of Drainage Basin and Characteristics  
            A drainage basin is an area of land drained by a river and its tributaries. It is the area within 
            which all all surface and subsurface water will eventually find its way into the same river or 
            water body.  
            One drainage basin is separated from another by a ridge of highland called a watershed. Any 
            precipitation that falls on the other side of the watershed will flow into a river in the nearby 
            river basin.   
            A drainage basin and its watershed  
            In Cameroon, there are four main drainage basins, namely the Atlantic and Congo Basins 
            in the Southern region; and the Niger and Chad Basins in the northern region.  
            Characteristics of Drainage Basins 
            Drainage basin characteristics can be viewed in terms of size, shape and gradient of slope, 
            soil/rock cover and vegetation cover. These are called basin or catchment characteristics. These 
            7 | P a g e 
            influence the rate and path of water entering and passing through the basin as output as well as 
            the amount of water stored. 
             Basin size: This relates to the surface area covered by the drainage basin. Some 
            drainage basins cover large areas while others cover smaller areas.  In Cameroon, the 
            Atlantic drainage basin is the largest, while the Chad basin is the smallest. 
             Basin shape: This relates to the overall form of a drainage basin. Drainage basins 
            maybe circular, triangular or elongated. These affect differently the distances and time 
            that runoff in the basin would cover before converging in the main river.  This is inturn 
            affects river discharge and the risk of floods in the basin. 
             Basin gradient: This refers to the steepness of the slope of the basin. This determines 
            whether more precipitated water will run off or infiltrate. Some basins have gentle 
            slopes while others are very steep.  
             Basin soil and rock (geology): some basins are covered by impermeable soils or rocks 
            which hinder infiltration/percolation and rather encourage runoff. Others have a 
            covering of permeable soils/rocks which allow more water to infiltrate or percolate and 
            less to run off. 
             Vegetation cover: some basins have a dense vegetation cover which increases 
            interception rate. Infiltration also increase as the roots create openings, while run off is 
            low. Others have sparse vegetation which results in high run off and low infiltration. 
            II. 
            Drainage Basin Cycle as an Open System 
            Unlike the global hydrological cycle, drainage basin’s hydrological cycle operates as an 
            open system. This is because water flows in and out of the basin’s boundary. It 
            therefore involves inputs, outputs, storage and flows or processes. See the diagram 
            below;

            Drainage basin as an open system  
            a. Inputs  
            These include: 
             Water in its various forms brought into the basin via precipitation. This comes in mainly in 
            the form of rain and snow. 
             Solar energy which comes into the basin through direct solar radiation or insolation. This 
            provides the energy needed to power the hydrological cycle.  
            b. Storages  
            This embodies water stored in the atmosphere in vapour form (atmospheric moisture), the soil, 
            depressions or hollows on the surface such as lakes or pools, vegetation storage and river 
            channels (channel storage), in permeable rocks underground as ground water.  
            c. Flows or transfer  
            This relates to the processes that link the different water storages. These include infiltration, 
            percolation, throughflow, baseflow (ground water flow) and run off.  
            d. Outputs: This relates to water leaving the system. It includes; 
             Water loss via evapotranspiration: This is the loss of water from the system to the 
            atmosphere in the form of water vapour. This occurs at almost every stage or store: from 
            
            
            
            -water via  
            Precipitation  -solar energy  
            Storages  -Atmospheric moisture -interception storage  -surface water e.g. lakes -soil moisture  
            Channel storage (streams) 
            Ground Water  
            Flows  -Stemflow/throughfall  -Surface runoff  -infiltration, throughflow  -percolation  -Baseflow  
            
            Water loss via: -Evapotranspiration  
            -channel runoff  
            -deep outflow  
            interception storage, surface water, soil etc.  Water vapour represents a considerable loss of 
            moisture from any basin through the processes of evaporation and transpiration. Under 
            some climatic conditions, evapotranspiration may be so high to exceed the precipitation 
            input, thus effectively cutting out river flow.  
             Water loss via channel runoff or stream flow: River discharge- the amount of water that 
            passes a given point, in a given amount of time. The final link that transfers water out of the 
            drainage basin system is the channel. This water flows as rivers or streams into the sea such 
            as the Rivers Sanaga, Wouri and Nyong or to the lake such as River Logone. This 
            represents water loss from the different basins involved. The efficiency with which it does 
            so depends on its size and shape and the intricacy of the network of which it is part.  
             Water loss via deep outflow: This is the movement of water from deeper ground water 
            that is not discharged into river channels but directly into the sea underground. Not all flow 
            from groundwater needs to be into the river channel, for it may be so deep that it can only 
            discharge directly into the sea, a lake or another river basin downstream to which the 
            particular river channel is a tributary or to an even deeper storage zone.  Below 1000m, 
            ground water is saline and is fossil water which has accumulated over millennia. This 
            contributes very little in the cycle and thus, considered an output. 
            Lesson 4: Effects of Human Activities on the Hydrological Cycle 
            Man has and can interfere with every aspect of the hydrological cycle. Man interferes with the 
            water storages, the flows or processes and the inputs and outputs. Although man interferes in 
            the hydrological cycle in a variety of ways with varying impacts, our focus will be on three 
            main human activities. These include deforestation and Afforestation and agriculture.  
            a. Impact of urbanisation on the hydrological cycle  
            Urbanisation of a drainage basin transforms every surface, storage area and flow within it. 
            Areas once occupied by vegetation are now tarmac and where surfaces once varied in colour 
            from season to season, they are now permanently grey, and their albedo lowered etc. The 
            impact of urbanisation is not only within its immediate environment but also for a considerable 
            distance downstream.  
            The major impact of urbanisation downstream is to increase the height of river flood, a 
            significant reduction in lag time for storms and a significant change in magnitude and speed of 
            the river rising after the storm. 
            Road construction can play in transforming a small stream channel to a size double orm ore 
            than the previous size.  
            10 | P a g e 
            One consequence of urbanisation is the need for increasing control and management of water 
            supply both to provide the urban population and to offset the more wild fluctuations of river 
            flow that result from urban growth.  
            b. Impact of Agriculture  
            Intensification of agriculture means more irrigation and more agrichemical seepage, which 
            reduces quality of water for recreation. Some crops such as sugar cane and certain rice species 
            are highly consumed by the world’s population. The cultivation of these crops necessitates 
            much water. On average, 2500mm six times of water during a ten week growing period is used 
            and this is largely drawn from the water table. The rate of recharge is usually not 
            commensurate to the volume used. Thus, this leads to a reduction in groundwater which will 
            eventually affect base flow and the volume of water in the streams.  
            c. Impact of deforestation and Afforestation 
            Deforestation and the planting of trees afresh to replace once destroyed forest within a river 
            basin will significantly affect the flow characteristics, the size of water stored on the surface 
            and underground as well as the input and output of water in the drainage basin.  
            Deforestation will cause a river’s discharge to increase considerably above the expected flow. 
            d. Impact of dam construction  
            This arises from the fact that on bare surfaces, infiltration is lowered and more runoff is 
            generated, which fills the channels. 
            In the reverse direction, the planting of trees within a drainage basin will significantly slow 
            down runoff by increasing infiltration. Forests then increase the lag time and by so even-out the 
            supply of runoff to the channel by operating controls on interception, evapotranspiration, 
            overland flow and even through flow. They also reduce the supply of sediments to a channel by 
            checking slope movements of soil and debris.  
            This affects the areas up and downstream. Reservoirs act as debris traps and this affects the 
            load transported and the supply of sediment to features downstream. It also affects the work 
            capability of the water discharging from the dam.  
            In addition, the flow regime below the dam will be regulated, peaks and troughs ironed out, 
            which could mean the river is no longer able to remove the debris contributed by unregulated 
            tributaries below the dam, perhaps reducing channel capacity in time. 
            Streams that formerly braided may be less inclined to do so both because of the reduction in 
            load and the regularisation of flow. In hot climates, dam construction may lead to increased 
            evaporation, thus reducing the river’s annual average discharge, conceivably altering local 
            patterns of humidity and precipitation. 
            11 | P a g e 
            Degradation of watershed and management strategies 
            Most watersheds, which are sources of water for several communities are witnessing rapid 
            degradation. This embodies the major watersheds in Cameroon such as the Adamawa Plateau 
            and Western Highlands, as well as small watersheds (which are subsets of the major ones) such 
            as the Tubah Upland Watershed and Guzang Watersheds in the North West Region of 
            Cameroon.  
            Evidence of water shed degradation include: dwindling or drying up of springs, reduction in 
            the volume of streams or rivers, especially during the dry season, fall in Hydroelectricity 
            (HEP), water contamination.  
            Causes of Watershed Degradation 
            a. Natural causes: They include climate related changes such as global warming, 
            desertification. These cause the drying up of vegetation cover. This is in turn is responsible 
            for the rapid evaporative loss of water and soil erosion and silting of streams.  
            b. Human causes: human activities are largely responsible for watershed degradation. Rapid 
            population growth and the search for basic requirements like food, fuel, fodder, domestic 
            water and shelter have caused invasion and destruction of upland forests and watersheds. 
            The major actions include:  
             Removal of the vegetation cover, overgrazing, poor farming techniques in watersheds such 
            as shifting cultivation, slope-wise cultivation expose the soil to erosion.  
             Afforestation or reafforestation with water-draining species of trees such as eucalyptus and 
            cypress result in the reduction in water yield and increased need for space for human 
            settlement.  
             All of these have caused the invasion and destruction of vegetation in watersheds. This 
            reduces infiltration of rainwater and promotes runoff, soil erosion and siltation of streams.  
            Watershed management strategies 
            These are measures aimed at preventing further degradation or rehabilitating already degraded 
            watersheds. The main actors are governments, international organizations, NGOs (e.g. 
            HELVETAS in the NW Region) and local communities. Watershed management strategies 
            include  
             Regular monitoring of whole watersheds. 
             Construction of natural levees, dykes to reduce loss down slope. 
             Planting of water retaining trees on basin slopes.  
             Dam construction to reduce the amount of water that runs on the surface downstream. 
            12 | P a g e 
             Adopting sustainable farming practices such as terracing, contour ploughing, mulching and 
            agro forestry. 
             Marking of new land use units involving protected areas, areas for farming etc. Steep 
            slopes can be allowed as green space.  
             Pasture improvement  
             Sensitization and education of farmers on sustainable approaches.  
            Challenges in managing watersheds 
             More benefit to downstream users while upstream users benefit very little. 
             Political boundaries and land rights do not follow drainage divides. 
             Top bottom approaches do not work. 
             Problems of land tenure. Most watersheds in uplands are considered communal land. Those 
            farming or working in the watershed do not always have land titles and therefore see no 
            need investing in long-term sustainable projects such as agroforestry. 
            TOPIC: THE DRAINAGE BASIN HYDROLOGICAL 
            Meaning 
            Lesson 5: Evapotranspiration as a Major Output in the Drainage Basin Cycle 
            I. 
            Evapotranspiration is a composite term for the combined loss of water from ground surfaces, 
            water surfaces and from plant organs in the form of water vapour to the atmosphere. It 
            embodies evaporation and transpiration. Evaporation is the direct loss of water from the surface 
            and from water bodies, while transpiration is the loss of water to the atmosphere as vapour by 
            plants through the stomata or tiny pore spaces on leaves.  
            It is the major output by which water is taken away from the earth’s surface to the atmosphere. 
            It thus represents the link between surface water and plant water storage on the one hand and 
            atmospheric moisture on the other hand. The conditions necessary for this process to occur 
            include availability of energy to convert liquid water to gaseous state. This energy is derived 
            mainly from the sun although sensible heat from the atmosphere or from the ground may also 
            be significant. It also occurs when there is less moisture in the atmosphere than on the surface, 
            that is, when there is a vapour pressure gradient between the ground and the air.  
            II. 
            Types of evapotranspiration  
            Two types of evapotranspiration have been recognised: Potential and Actual 
            Evapotranspiration.  
            a. Potential Evapotranspiration (PE): It is the theoretical maximum amount of water that 
            would be lost from a give area on the surface of the earth to the atmosphere if there is 
            13 | P a g e 
            continuous supply of water or better still, if the supply of water is not limited. This is the 
            type which occurs over ocean surfaces and irrigated areas where water is continuously 
            available. 
            b. Actual Evapotranspiration (AE): On the other hand, it is the real or true amount of water 
            that is lost from the surface and plants to the atmosphere in the existing moisture 
            conditions. It is therefore more variable and often lower than potential evapotranspiration 
            because of the limited supply of water in some areas. 
            PE is always greater than AE.  The two are equal only where there is constant and adequate 
            supply of water to meet the atmospheric demand such as in irrigated areas or over permanent 
            water bodies like the oceans, seas and lakes. Both are important. PE provides some measure of 
            possible agricultural productivity, while AE provides information vital for the determination of 
            soil moisture and the local water balance.  
            III. 
            Measurement of evapotranspiration  
            Three main methods can be used to measure evapotranspiration rate. These are the direct 
            measurement using lysimeters and evaporation pans, the meteorological formulae and 
            moisture/water budget methods. The direct measurement methods are explained below 
             Evaporation Pans: It involves the use of a shallow pan filled with water. The amount of 
            water lost is compared with the original input of water. The rate at which water is lost 
            through evaporation is measured with the use of a gauge. The disadvantage of this method 
            is that it measures only potential evaporation since water is continuously available. There 
            are no plants in pan thus transpirational losses are not considered. Besides, it does not 
            consider surface roughness and its implication on rates of evaporation. However, it is 
            relatively inexpensive and easy to handle in the field.  
             Lysimeter method: It requires the use of a huge tank containing soil and vegetation. 
            Changes in soil moisture storage are measured by weighing the tank. The disadvantage is 
            that it is cumbersome and very expensive.  
            IV. 
            Spatial and Temporal variations in Rates of Evapotranspiration  
            Evapotranspiration rates refer to the speed at which water is lost from the surface, plants or 
            both to the atmosphere. This rate varies enormously over the earth’s surface and also overtime. 
            While some areas experience high rates of evaporation in particular or evapotranspiration in 
            general, others exhibit low rates.  
            Spatially, variations exist between: 
             Tropical areas with high rates and extra-tropical (temperate and polar regions) with low 
            rates. 
             Coastal areas exhibiting high rates and continental interiors with low rates. 
            14 | P a g e 
             Water surfaces with higher rates and land surfaces experiencing low rates.  
             Vegetated areas with higher rates and un-vegetated areas with low rates.  
             Rural areas with higher rates and urban areas with lower rates.  
            Temporally, rates of evapotranspiration are higher during the day when sunlight is available 
            and in summer –the warm season, but low at night and in the winter-the cold season-when little 
            heat is made available. 
            V. 
            Factors affecting Variations in Rates of evapotranspiration  
            These factors can be grouped under meteorological and non-meteorological factors. These 
            operate at varying intensities and combinations over space and time. 
            A. Meteorological factors  
            They include solar energy, wind, and relative humidity and vapour pressure gradient.  
            1. Solar energy:  it is a key factor that powers the process of evapotranspiration. The amount 
            of solar radiation received is directly proportional to evapotranspiration rates. This is 
            because before 1 gram of water changes to vapour, there must be a minimum of about 490 
            calories of heat.  Without input of energy, water cannot be converted from liquid to the 
            gaseous state. High temperatures induce high level of molecular motion. Water molecules 
            become more agitated, move faster, knocking against each other and some attain escape 
            velocity and so skip out of the water body into the air as vapour. Low or reduced 
            temperature does the reverse as molecular motion is much reduced and few attain escape 
            velocity.  
            The rate of evapotranspiration is therefore high in the tropical areas which receive greater input 
            of solar energy. Here, the sun’s rays fall vertically, passing though a short atmospheric distance 
            with less of its energy absorbed, scattered and reflected by atmospheric impurities.  
            By contrast, the sun’s rays fall obliquely in the extra-tropical regions. Meaning that, the rays 
            pass through a longer atmospheric distance with much of the energy absorbed, scattered and 
            reflected by atmospheric impurities. There is therefore less energy on the surface to power the 
            process of evapotranspiration. This explains why the rate of evapotranspiration is low in the 
            middle and high latitudes. Besides, these extra-tropical areas experience great variations in the 
            lengths of day and night. During winter, nights are longer and this imposes a limit to the 
            amount of energy received by the earth’s surface and the rate of evapotranspiration.  
            Moreover, contrast in insolation between sunny slopes (adrets) and and shaded slopes (ubac) of 
            mountains account for local differences in evapotranspiration rates between the different sides. 
            It is high on the sun-facing slopes with greater insolation and low on the non sun facing slopes 
            which are shaded.  
            15 | P a g e 
            2. Wind: This is the second important meteorological factor after solar energy. Air movement 
            permits the removal of the lower more moist layers of the atmosphere in direct contact with 
            evaporating surface, thus making room for transpiration and evaporated water to leave the 
            surface. Hence, windy weather enhances greater evapotranspiration than hot still air. Also, 
            areas characterised by high wind speeds are associated with greater evaporation. Calm, still 
            or less windy air allows escaping molecules to linger around evaporating surface thus 
            reducing the rate of evaporation or transpiration as air soon saturates. 
            3. Relative humidity (RH): The amount of moisture in the air relative to the maximum 
            amount it can hold at the prevailing temperature determines how much and how fast the 
            atmosphere can receive more water vapour. When relative humidity is high (say 60 to 
            99%), it means the air can take very little water vapour and thus less evaporation occurs. 
            When RH is low like in hot desert regions, it means the air is dry and thirsty or there is still 
            ample room from more vapour to join those already in the air and more transpiration and 
            evaporation occur.  
            4. Vapour pressure gradient: Evapotranspiration will only occur if there is a vapour 
            pressure gradient between the ground or surface and the air above it. Vapour pressure is the 
            weight exerted by molecules of water vapour in a given volume of air. It is that part of the 
            total atmospheric pressure which is exerted by water vapour. Vapour pressure gradient 
            relates to the difference between pressure of vapour between upper and lower layers of air. 
            If the vapour pressure gradient is low (small difference), the rate of evapotranspiration will 
            also be low. By contrast, areas that exhibit high vapour pressure gradients tend to register 
            high rates of evapotranspiration. That is, when the humidity of the air is less than that of the 
            ground surface, evaporation rates will be high. 
            B. Non- meteorological factors  
            These include physiological, hydrological and anthropogenic factors. 
            1. Physiological factors or the nature of the surface: This has to do with the nature of the 
            land surface. The nature of the surface is an important control on the rate of 
            evapotranspiration. Rates of evapotranspiration will be lower in mountainous areas with 
            steep slopes due to the fact that, water is rapidly carried away by run-off; leaving very 
            small amounts for evaporation. Conversely, low lying areas tend to retain more water 
            within the soils and depressions for eventual evaporation. 
            2. Hydrological factors: This relates to the nature of water. Where water exist in the solid 
            state or in the form of ice or ice sheets like in the Polar regions, the rate of 
            evapotranspiration is low. This is because it takes time for water to change from the solid to 
            16 | P a g e 
            the liquid state before evapotranspiration occurs. Conversely, areas that host liquid water 
            like in the tropical regions tend to record high rate of evapotranspiration 
            Differences also exist in the rate of evapotranspiration between saline and fresh water bodies. It 
            is higher over the fresh water bodies because fresh water can easily be converted into vapour 
            than saline water, where water is held around salt particles through surface tension effect. 
            3. Plant or vegetation characteristics: The effect of stomatal opening, amount and extent of 
            vegetal cover of the surface, nature of plant leaves and duration of vegetation and leaves 
            combine to enhance or restrict evapotranspiration rates.  
             Generally, the rate of evapotranspiration is higher over vegetated surfaces than in their un –vegetated counterparts. This is because the dense vegetation cover draws up more water 
            from the soil, and the excess not used by the plants is transpired into the atmosphere. 
             The dense broad leaf forest send out more vapour by transpiration to the air than needle 
            leaf coniferous forest and grassland vegetation. This is so because, a broader leaf size 
            offers a greater surface area on the leaves from which water is lost to the atmosphere. The 
            size of plants also affects transpiration. Huge tall trees take more soil moisture and 
            equally send out more, than small short grasses and trees or shrubs.  
            4. Anthropogenic factors: Human action is also responsible for the spatial variation in 
            evapotranspiration rates. Urban areas with tarmac surfaces have low rates of 
            evapotranspiration. This is because water is easily evacuated through runoff over the 
            cemented surfaces. This leaves very little or no water for evapotranspiration. By contrast, 
            rural areas register high rates of evapotranspiration because water stagnates or is stored in 
            the soil or depressions for eventual evapotranspiration.  
            VI. 
            Significance of evapotranspiration  
             It acts as the major link between water on the surface of the earth and the atmosphere, a 
            link that operates at all stages of the cycle. For example, during run-off, some of the water 
            is lost to the atmosphere; some of the intercepted water is also lost to the atmosphere etc.  
             It controls plant growth so that the plants themselves can play their own role in the 
            hydrological cycle. The control on plant growth arises from the fact that, it is through 
            transpiration that some of the excess water is lost from the plant.  Moreover, transpiration 
            enables nutrients to be transported to all parts of the plant as water circulates. 
             Evapotranspiration is also important because it helps in the redistribution of energy.  The 
            heat that is locked up (latent heat) in water vapour is released in the atmosphere after 
            condensation of water vapour. 
            17 | P a g e 
             Evapotranspiration signifies water loss from the earth’s surface, an indication of soil 
            moisture deficit. This signifies water unavailable for exploitation playing an important part 
            in water resource utilization. This necessitates additional effort on the part of man, through 
            irrigation and other water retaining and acquisition methods.  
             Evapotranspiration is an important source of atmospheric moisture; a very important phase 
            in the hydrological cycle.  
             The amount of moisture lost from the evaporating surface is an indication of the 
            atmosphere’s potential for precipitation.  
             The relationship between potential evapotranspiration and precipitation is used to define 
            drought and delimit arid areas. 
             It is a measure of water needs of crops especially the difference between potential and 
            actual evapotranspiration.  
            Lesson 6: Precipitation as a major input  
            I. 
            Meaning  
            Precipitation refers to all forms of water that reach the earth’s surface from the condensation of 
            water vapour. It occurs in different forms such as dew, rain, hail, snow and sleet 
            II. 
            Forms of precipitation   
             Dew: It is a deposit of water droplets formed at night by the condensation of water vapour 
            from the air onto the surfaces of objects such as blades of grass, which are freely exposed 
            to the sky. It forms on clear nights when the air is calm or, preferably, when the wind is 
            light. 
             Rain: It is falling drops of liquid water that are 0.5mm in diameter or greater. It is common 
            in the tropical region. 
             Drizzle: It is very light rain usually less than 0.5mm in diameter. It usually falls from low 
            stratus clouds. 
             Snow: It is solid form of water falling from the atmosphere to the surface of the earth in the 
            form of ice crystals having a feathery structure. It is common in the temperate and polar 
            regions.  
             Sleet: It is partially melted snow and forms the precipitation which falls as snow and rain. 
            It is common in the temperate region especially towards the tropical limits. 
             Hail: It is the largest solid form of precipitation and which are of the size of peas or larger. 
            It is common in cold places in the Temperate Region. It can be very destructive when it 
            falls on roofs and glass works.

            III. 
            Process of precipitation formation  
            There are two complementary theories to explain the physical processes involved in 
            precipitation formation. These are the coalescence theory and the Bergeron-Findeison theory   
            a. The coalescence or collision theory: This theory explains how precipitation is formed in 
            the tropics. The high temperatures characteristics of this region cause high rates of 
            evaporation. On rising, the water vapour condenses on reaching dew point to form clouds 
            or droplets of water. Precipitation begins in a cloud when cloud droplets or ice crystals 
            grow large and heavy enough to fall toward the ground. Cloud droplets may grow bigger as 
            large droplets collide and merge with smaller drops. It is for this reason that the process is 
            called coalescence. 
            b. Bergeron-Findeison theory growth of ice crystals: Unlike the collision theory, the 
            Bergeron- Findeison theory explains precipitation formation outside the tropics. Ice crystals 
            grow larger through a process called the ice crystal process, or Bergeron process, after the 
            Swedish meteorologist Tor Bergeron, who proposed that raindrops begin as ice crystals. If 
            the temperatures inside a cloud are below freezing, then liquid cloud droplets and ice 
            crystals may coexist. Liquid water droplets existing at below freezing temperatures are 
            called super cooled droplets. If super cooled droplets and ice crystals are close together, 
            then water vapour may leave the liquid droplets and freeze onto the ice crystals. In this 
            manner, the ice crystals grow larger at the expense of the surrounding super cooled 
            droplets. As ice crystals grow larger by the Bergeron process, they may become heavy 
            enough to fall. Falling ice crystals may collide and stick to other ice crystals, forming a 
            snow flake. Ice crystals may also collide with super cooled cloud droplets into ice on 
            contact. These ice particles ma even stick together producing a chunk of icy matter called 
            graupel.  
            IV. 
            Types of rainfall  
            Rainfall occurs when air is caused to rise for condensation to take place. Depending on what 
            causes the air to rise, three main types of rainfall have been distinguished. These are 
            convectional, orographic and frontal or cyclonic rainfall.   
            19 | P a g e 
            1. Convectional Rainfall: This is a type of rainfall which occurs when water vapour is forced 
            to rise to the atmosphere as a result of the heating of the earth’s surface.  
            It is common in the tropical region where temperatures are high year round. When air is heated, 
            it expands, becomes lighter and rises. If the rising air reaches dew point, condensation takes 
            place and cumulunimbus clouds are formed. This results in heavy rainfall which is 
            accompanied by thunder and lightning. It often occurs in the afternoons or early evenings after 
            the convectional system has worked for some time. Lightning is caused by the contact between 
            positive electric charges on the ground. The lightning produces heat causing air to expand 
            violently and produce the sound of thunder. This is the type of rainfall that is common in the 
            southern part of Cameroon.  
            2. Orographic or relief rainfall: This is a type of rainfall which occurs on the windward 
            slopes of high mountains especially those which are aligned along the coast. Orographic 
            rainfall is formed when water vapour is forced to rise by a relief barrier such as a mountain. 
            Winds blowing over the sea or ocean pick up much moisture. On reaching the highland, the 
            air is forced to rise. The rising air may reach dew point and condensation takes place. 
            Cumulunimbus clouds are formed from which heavy rains falls on the windward slope 
            20 | P a g e 
            Orographic rainfall 
            The leeward slope is usually dry with no rainfall and described as rain shadow.  This is because 
            much of the water vapour is transformed to cloud on the windward slope. Moreover, the 
            descending air on the leeside warms and this inhibits the formation of rainfall. The wettest 
            places in the world experience orographic rainfall. Examples are Debunscha on the windward 
            slope of Mount Cameroon, Cherrapunji on the windward slope of mount Assam in India. 
            Muyuka on the leeside of Mount Cameroon is relatively dry.  
            3. Cyclonic or frontal rainfall: Cyclonic or frontal rainfall is formed when water vapour is 
            carried to the atmosphere as a result of the meeting of two air bodies with different 
            temperature and moisture characteristics. 
            Cyclonic rainfall 
            21 | P a g e 
            It is common in the mid-latitudes (temperate region), where water vapour is carried to the 
            atmosphere as a result of the meeting of the warm moist tropical air and the cold polar air 
            masses around latitude 60o north and south of the equator. On meeting, the warm moist 
            tropical air mass which is lighter rises above the cold dense air. If the rising warm air reaches 
            dew point, condensation takes place. Clouds (nimbostratus) are formed from which heavy but 
            steady rain fall occurs. It lasts much longer than convectional rainfall.   
            V. 
            Spatial variations of precipitation  
            The average annual precipitation of the entire world is about 1050mm. This is unevenly 
            distributed. Some areas receive abundant precipitation while others have less.  
             In terms of latitude, there is abundant precipitation in the equatorial zone from latitude 0o to 
            10o North and South of the Equator. E.g. Amazon and Congo basins with over 1500mm per 
            annum; moderate to large amounts in the mid-latitudes (arond latitude 60o) but low 
            amounts in Sub tropical belts (around 30o) and Polar regions (70o-90oN and S)  
             Fairly abundant in eastern coasts of continents in the low latitudes (due to effects of the 
            trade winds) and western coasts in temperate latitudes (affected by the westerlies) e.g. west 
            coast of Canada and Europe. 
             Abundant precipitation on windward sides of mountains such as in Debunscha in 
            Cameroon and Cherrapunji in India, but low on leeward sides. 
             Abundant along coastal areas, where winds are onshore or which are bath by warm ocean 
            currents, but less in more interior locations. Coastal areas where winds are rather offshore 
            or which are bath by cold ocean currents have low precipitation e.g. west coast of Namibia.  
            VI. 
            A. Principal factors  
            Factors influencing the distribution of precipitation in the world  
            The global pattern of precipitation distribution depends on two broad groups of factors namely; 
            principal and secondary factors. 
            This relates to the influence of latitude.  
            Influence of latitude  
            Latitude does not cause precipitation. Its influence on precipitation is therefore indirect. This is 
            through its effects on differences in temperature and atmospheric pressure. These differences 
            cause air to rise, sink, diverge, or converge at different latitudes. These in turn cause high or 
            low precipitation in different latitudes. 
            Generally, amounts of precipitation tend to decrease with increase in latitude from the 
            equatorial zone towards the poles, but it is not a smooth regular decrease.  
            22 | P a g e 
            1. Temperature differences: Some latitudes experience high temperatures while others have 
            low temperatures due mainly to differences in the angle of incidence of sun’s rays. This 
            partly accounts for the uneven distribution of precipitation. Areas of high temperature such 
            as the equatorial region experience heavy rainfall.  Intensive heating of the surface causes 
            air to expand and rise. This often condenses to produce clouds and heavy convectional 
            rainfall.  
            Areas of low temperature such as the polar region are areas of low rainfall. Cold air is heavy 
            and tends to sink towards the surface of the earth. This prevents uplift of air and inhibits 
            condensation. Therefore little moisture is carried to the atmosphere. 
            2. Differences in Atmospheric Pressure: There are two latitudinal belts of low pressure and 
            two of high pressure in each hemisphere. These affect the amount of precipitation received 
            at various latitudes differently.  
             Areas of low pressure are marked by heavy rainfall e.g. the equatorial region. The heavy 
            rainfall is caused by the meeting of air masses or winds e.g. the North East Trade and South 
            East Trade winds at the equator; while the westerlies and the cold easterly winds from the 
            poles meet at a front at about latitude 60o.  This causes air to rise carrying moisture to the 
            atmosphere, which may eventually condense to form clouds and rain. 
             Areas of high pressure have low rainfall because they are characterised by sinking air. , e.g. 
            the sub-tropical high pressure belt between latitudes 25o and 35o north and south of the 
            equator.  The hot deserts of the world with very low rainfall are found in this region. For 
            example, the Sahara desert, the Kalahari and Namib deserts in Africa; the Atacama desert 
            in South America and the Thar Desert in India. The polar region is a high pressure area 
            between latitudes 80o and 90o has the lowest amount of precipitation in the world.  
            B. Secondary factors    
            3. Relief: The windward slopes of very high mountains are areas of heavy rainfall e.g. 
            Debunscha on the Windward slope of mount Cameroon and Chirrapunji on the windward 
            slope of the Himalayas Mountains. Places on the leesides of mountains are areas of low 
            rainfall. Such areas are cut off from moisture bearing winds. E.g Muyuka is on the rain 
            shadow side of mount Cameroon. 
            4. Ocean currents: Ocean currents can increase or reduce the amount of rainfall of an area. 
            Areas washed by warm ocean currents usually experience heavy rainfall. This is because 
            warm ocean currents cause air to expand and rise carrying moisture to the atmosphere. The 
            heavy rainfall on the coast of Mozambique and Natal province in South Africa is because 
            the coast is washed by the Mozambique warm ocean current. 
            23 | P a g e 
            Meanwhile, areas washed by cold currents are areas of low rainfall. Cold ocean currents cause 
            air to become cold and heavy and sink. Therefore, little moisture is carried to the atmosphere. 
            The coastal area of the Namib desert has low rainfall because it is washed by the Benguela cold 
            ocean current. Also, the low rainfall of the Western Sahara is due to the fact that the area is 
            washed by the canaries cold ocean current.  
            5. Distance from the sea: Coastal areas where the winds are on-shore receive high or ample 
            precipitation than those further in the interior. This is because the nearby sea supplies the 
            atmosphere with more water vapour through evaporation. This may eventually condense tp 
            produce precipitation. This is the case of the west coasts in the Mid-latitudes where the 
            westerly winds blow onshore; and east coast of continents in the tropical region, where the 
            trade winds are onshore. There is an absence of water in the interior of continents.  
            6. Vegetation: areas with extensive and dense vegetation cover, especially forest vegetation 
            such as the tropical rainforest, are associated with abundant precipitation. This is because 
            the 
            dense vegetation supplies ample moisture to the atmosphere through 
            evapotranspiration, which may eventually condense to form precipitation. In contrast, areas 
            with sparse vegetation such as deserts supply little or no moisture to the atmosphere to 
            cause precipitation.  
            7. Urban effects: generally, precipitation is higher in urban areas than the neighbouring rural 
            areas. It is about 10% higher in urban areas with more rainy days than in rural 
            neighbourhoods. The reasons for this include: 
             The many tall buildings serve as uplift mechanisms, which force air to rise. This favours 
            the formation of clouds and precipitation. 
             Moreover, the industries dominant in urban areas produce pollutants, some of which are 
            hygroscopic and form condensation nuclei on which clouds and raindrops develop. This 
            results in more clouds/precipitation and more rainy days in urban areas when compared 
            with the rural counterparts.  
            VII. 
            Significance of precipitation to the water cycle 
             Precipitation is needed to replenish water to the earth. Without precipitation, the earth 
            would be an enormous desert. 
             The amount and duration of precipitation events affect both water level and water quality 
            within an estuary.  
             Precipitation supplies fresh water to estuaries, which is an important source of dissolved 
            oxygen and nutrients.

            Lesson 7: Interception as a storage 
            I. Meaning and Types of Interception  
            Not all precipitated water actually gets to the surface directly. Some is captured or trapped by 
            by plants. This is described as the process of interception. Interception can be defined as the 
            trapping or the capturing of precipitated water by plants.  
            Two types can be distinguished can be distinguished: primary and secondary interception.  
            a. Primary interception: primary interception is effected by taller vegetation such as trees 
            or forest. The captured water constitutes interception storage. This can be evaporated 
            directed back to the atmosphere. In another extreme, the water may find its way to the 
            surface in two main ways: dripping of the leaves and branches to the ground, a process 
            called through fall. It may simply flow down along the branches and stems in a process 
            called stemflow. 
            b. Secondary interception: This is water that reaches the surface and is intercepted by the 
            ground flora or undergrowth. 
            II. Factors influencing interception rate  
            Interception rate varies over space and time depending on a number of factor, which fall into 
            three main groups namely; the nature of precipitation, the character of vegetation and land use 
            patterns (anthropogenic factors) 
            1. The nature of precipitation: The main aspects of precipitation that determines the amount 
            of water intercepted are its form, intensity and duration.  
             The amount of water that is captured or trapped largely depends on the form of 
            precipitation, whether rain, snow or drizzle. If precipitation is the form of rain, then more 
            water will be captured.  This is the case in the equatorial region where precipitation is 
            essentially in the form of rainfall. This is because the droplets of rain water are lighter to be 
            contained by the canopy of the plant. In contrast, the interception rate will be low in areas 
            where precipitation is mainly in the form of snow such as in the temperate region. This is 
            because the snow balls cannot be contained by plants. 
             The intensity of the precipitation is another determinant of the rate of interception. 
            Interception is low in areas experiencing heavy precipitation. This is because the raindrop 
            impacts are too high for the canopies to contain. Conversely, interception is almost at 100% 
            in areas experiencing light rainfall or drizzle. Also, interception is higher at the beginning 
            of any rainfall than at the peak when its intensity increases.  
             The duration of precipitation is another determinant of interception rate. The rate of 
            interception is high where precipitation has occurred for a short while. Sometimes, all of 
            the precipitated water is captured. By contrast, interception is low after prolonged 
            precipitation. This is because the leaves and branches have been sufficiently soaked or 
            saturated with water that they can no longer hold water or retain water.  
            2. The character of vegetation:  This embodies the type of vegetation, density of the plant 
            cover and the size and shape of the leaves. 
             With regard to the type of vegetation, it has been found out that the rate of interception is 
            higher over forest or woodland vegetation than over grassland vegetation. This suggests 
            that, the equatorial regions that are characterised by forest vegetation capture more water 
            than the savannah and Temperate grassland regions dominated by herbs or grasses.  
             The size and shape of leaves cause variation interception rates over the earth’s surface. The 
            broad leaf characteristic of the tropical rainforest hold more precipitated water than the 
            needle-shaped leaves of the coniferous forest. The surface area to capture water is small in 
            the latter case.  
            Significance of interception  
             The density of the vegetation cover is another major determinant of the rate of interception. 
            A dense vegetation cover will intercept more water than sparse vegetation cover with gaps. 
            It is for this reason that the rate of interception is high in the equatorial region with a dense 
            and luxuriant vegetation cover (the tropical rainforest) than in the tropical savannah with 
            sparse vegetation cover.   
            3. Land use patterns (anthropogenic factors): Human activity is also responsible for the 
            spatial and temporal variation in the interception rate. The rate of interception will be low 
            in areas that have suffered from deforestation as well as those that have been cultivated. By 
            contrast, afforested areas record high rate of interception.  
            III. 
             Interception is particularly important in tropical rainforests in that it helps to reduce the 
            effects of rain splash erosion on fragile soils. 
             Lowers the intensity of precipitation.  
             Washes solid particles and dissolved carbon from leaves affecting soil water chemistry and 
            weathering processes.  
             Usually results in a net loss of water available to the basin hydrological cycle.

            Lesson 8: Infiltration and overland flow  
            A. Infiltration  
            I. 
            Meaning of infiltration  
            Infiltration can be defined as the process by which water enters the soil or sinks into the soil. It 
            involves the vertical movement of water into the soil. Infiltration is a major link between water 
            on the surface (surface storage) and soil moisture. Every surface has its own infiltration 
            capacity and infiltration rate. 
             Infiltration capacity is the maximum rate at which water passes through the soil, often 
            expressed in millimetres per hour. That is, the rate at which the soil allows water to pass 
            through i. 
             Infiltration rate is the speed at which water enters the soil. The infiltrated water may flow 
            horizontally within the soil to emerge further down slope into the river, a process called 
            through flow. It may rather be absorbed by a network of roots of plants or eventually lost to 
            the atmosphere through the stomata on the leaves through transpiration. Yet. Some may 
            continue vertically through the pores and joints of rocks into ground water store, a process 
            described as percolation.  
            II. 
            Spatial Pattern of Infiltration 
            Infiltration rate varies spatially. A distinction can be made between areas of high and low 
            infiltration rates. Differences exist between: 
             Vegetated areas with high rates and non vegetated areas with low rates. 
             High land areas with low rates and low lands with high. 
             Urban areas with low rates and rural areas with high. 
             Permeable surfaces with high rates and impermeable surfaces with low rates. 
            III. 
            Factors affecting the Rate of Infiltration  
            The rate of infiltration varies enormously over space and time. A number of factors account for 
            this. These include; antecedent precipitation or antecedent soil moisture conditions, the nature 
            of precipitation, the nature of the soil, the gradient of the slope, the vegetation cover and 
            human activity.  
            1. Antecedent precipitation or antecedent soil moisture: This relates to the amount of 
            water already in the soil. If previous rain has saturated the soil, the rate of infiltration will 
            be low. This is because the pore spaces have been sufficiently filled with water that, 
            additional water would no longer be contained. This water will instead be evacuated 
            through run-off. If the soil is not saturated, more water would enter the soil. This means 
            that the rate of infiltration would be high. 
            27 | P a g e 
            2. Nature of precipitation: Aspects of precipitation that have a bearing on infiltration rate 
            include the type or form, the intensity and the duration. 
             With regard to the form, snow fall is associated with low infiltration. This is because time 
            is needed for the snow to melt before the water can sink into the soil. Such areas of low 
            infiltration include; the temperate and Polar regions where precipitation is essentially in the 
            form of snow. By contrast, precipitation in the form of rain and drizzle result in high rate of 
            infiltration everything being equal.  
             As to the intensity of precipitation, places with heavy precipitation have lower infiltration 
            than areas with less intense or light rain or drizzle. This is because the heavy rain drops 
            tend to seal the soil pore spaces blocking water from entering the soil. By contrast, light 
            rainfall with tiny slow falling drops easily penetrates as pores remain open and can cope 
            with input.  
             In terms of duration, the rate of infiltration changes with time.  Shortly after rain begins to 
            fall, infiltration rate will be relatively high since there are more available air spaces 
            between the soil particles.  As they become filled overtime, infiltration rate reduces.  
            3. Nature of the soil: This relates to the characteristic of the soil especially its texture, 
            structure and organic matter content. 
             With regard texture, sandy soils with larger pores compared with soils of clayey texture 
            with tiny pores portray different infiltration rates. Clay soils limit infiltration rate because 
            of their sticky nature with minute pore spaces that prevent water from draining through the 
            soil. Moreover there is greater capillarity in clay thus retaining more water than in sand. By 
            contrast, sandy soils increase the rate of infiltration because of their large pore spaces that 
            allow water to pass through easily.  
             With regard to soil structure, soils with crumb, blocky and prismatic structures with many 
            more fissures, cracks and pores (vertically arranged in case of prismatic structure) allow 
            much water to infiltrate. Massive soils with few or no fissures as well as platy structures in 
            which the peds are horizontally arranged slow down and even prevent infiltration.  
            4. Gradient of the slope (topography):  Steep slopes are associated with low infiltration rate. 
            For example, mountainous regions such as the Western Highlands of Cameroon and Andes 
            of South America. This is because of high run-off as the force of gravity is greater over 
            steep slopes. By contrast, gentle slopes are associated with high infiltration rate.  This is 
            because the surface can retain water that eventually the soil.  
            5. Vegetation cover:  vegetated areas have high rate of infiltration. This is due to the 
            following reasons: organic matter from the vegetation renders the soil porous, the plant 
            28 | P a g e 
            roots tend to open the soil for more water to pass through and plant leaves intercept 
            raindrop impact preventing the soil from being compacted. Although it is generally 
            accepted that vegetation increases infiltration rates, variation still occurs depending on the 
            type and density of vegetation. Broad leaf vegetation such as the tropical rain forest and 
            some deciduous species intercept and return more water back to the atmosphere thus 
            reducing in a way infiltration below. This contrasts with conifers needle shaped leaves of 
            pines, birch of the coniferous forest which allow water to reach the soil’s surface, thus 
            increasing infiltration. Similarly, dense grassland with a lot of fibrous root systems open up 
            soil much more than the Sahel Savannah with a lot of bare soil exposed in between dotted 
            tufts of bunched grasses. Thus infiltration rates are lower in the Sahel than in the Guinea 
            Savannah.  
            6. Anthropogenic factor (influence of man): In urban areas, tarmac surfaces reduce 
            infiltration rate as the pore spaces within the soil are sealed. In rural areas, cultivated 
            surfaces to increase the rate of infiltration. And in overgrazed areas, there is low rate of 
            infiltration due to constant trampling making the soil to be compacted. 
            7. Different agricultural land use types also account for variations in rats of infiltration 
            within the rural milieu. Some agricultural practices facilitate infiltration while others reduce 
            the rate. 
             Cattle rearing especially where the carrying capacity of land (pasture) is exceeded results in 
            overgrazing and compaction of soil by cattle. This reduces the rate of infiltration. 
             Arable farming of crops using crude tools such as cutlasses and hoes increases infiltration 
            by loosening and opening up the soil during tilling. 
             Moreover, the making of ridges across the slope reduces run-off, increases surface storage 
            in-between the ridges and facilitates or accelerates infiltration. The terracing of slopes on 
            hilly areas has the same effect. 
             On the contrary, mechanised agriculture using sophisticated furl-driven ploughs and 
            tractors as in the wheat land of North America compacts the sub soil and reduces 
            infiltration.  
            B. Overland flow or Surface Run-off 
            I. 
            Meaning of surface run-off  
            Overland flow or surface run-off is the flow of excess storm water, melt water, or water from 
            other sources over the earth’s surface. This might occur because soil saturated to full capacity, 
            because rain arrives more quickly than soil can absorb it, or because impervious areas (roofs 
            and pavement) send their runoff to surrounding soil that cannot absorb all of it. 
            29 | P a g e 
            Surface runoff is a major process of the water cycle. It is the primary agent in soil erosion. In 
            other words, runoff is generated when rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the 
            soil, leading to the build-up of a surface layer of water. It also occurs when depressions filled 
            with water begin to overflow.  
            II. 
            Types of overland flow  
            There are two type of overland flow; Hortonian over land flow and saturation overland flow.  
             Hortonian overland flow describes the tendency of water to flow horizontally across land 
            surfaces when rainfall arrives more quickly that soil can absorb it. That is, rainfall has 
            exceeded infiltration capacity and depression storage capacity. It is common in semi-arid 
            and arid regions. 
             Saturation overland flow is surface runoff produced when the soil and depressions are 
            sufficiently filled and rain continues to fall.  Saturation over land flow comes from two 
            distinguishable sources. In one case, rain falling on already saturated soil has no option but 
            to runoff. This case is termed direct precipitation on saturated areas. (DPSA).  The other 
            source termed return flow occurs if the rate of interflow entering a saturated area from 
            upslope exceeds the capacity for interflow to leave the area by flowing down hill through 
            the soil.  The excess interflow thus returns to the surface as runoff, hence the term return 
            flow. Whereas DPSA run off only occurs during and just after a rainfall event, return flow 
            seepage and continue as long as an interflow excess exists.  
            III. 
            Forms of overland flow  
            Overland flow occurs in two ways or forms; sheet flow or in the form of rivulets 
             In sheet flow, the water spreads uniformly over the surface as it moves down slope i.e. 
            water flows down slope as a wide shallow sheet. This form is common along slopes with 
            rocks of uniform resistance and where the slopes are gentle with no topographic 
            irregularities.  
             In the form of rivulets, the water is concentrated in rills or gullies. 
            IV. 
            Factors affecting the rate or the amount of surface runoff  
            These factors fall into two groups namely static and dynamic factors.  
            a. Static factors or catchment characteristics  
            These are factors that are permanent in the basin. These include nature of the surface 
            (permeability or porosity), vegetation cover, gradient of the slope, moisture content and land 
            use. 
            1. Nature of the surface: The amount of runoff generated in any place also depends on the 
            nature of the surface. Permeable surfaces which could be well-jointed or porous surfaces 
            reduce the amount of run-off. This is because a greater proportion of water is allowed to 
            30 | P a g e 
            infiltrate or percolate the surface. Limestone areas with well jointed rocks lack surface run
            off. Conversely, the amount of run-off in areas with impermeable, non porous surfaces is 
            often high. This is because the rates of infiltration and percolation are both low. This allows 
            more water to run on the surface. 
            2. Vegetation: Run-off is low in vegetated areas because of the increase rate of infiltration. 
            This is because the plant canopies reduce rain drop impact from sealing the pore spaces. 
            Secondly, the roots of the plant open up the soil for more water to infiltrate. In un-vegetated 
            areas, there is no vegetation cover to reduce rain drop impact. Soil pore spaces are sealed in 
            the course of rain and this increases surface run off as less water infiltrates. 
            3. Gradient or nature of the slope: Run-off is high over steep slopes due to low rate of 
            infiltration. Examples of such areas with steep slopes include; the Western Highlands of 
            Cameroon, the Himalayas Region in Asia and the Andes of South America. By contrast, 
            overland flow is lower over gentle slopes due to increase in the rate of infiltration. 
            4. Land use:  surface run-off is greater in urban centres due to presence of tarmac or 
            compacted surfaces. This reduces infiltration. Conversely, it is low in most rural areas 
            where a greater proportion of rainwater infiltrates the ploughed surfaces.  
            b. Dynamic factors 
            These are factors that change overtime. This relates mainly to the nature of precipitation. The 
            major determinants here are the form, intensity and duration of precipitation  
             Form: The amount of overland flow is slow in areas where precipitation occurs in the form 
            of snow (like in the temperate regions). This is because time is needed for the snow to melt 
            before it can flow over the surface. By contrast, overland flow is greater in hot humid areas 
            where precipitation occurs in the form of rain. However, the amount of run-off generated 
            would depend on the intensity and duration of precipitation. 
             Intensity: The amount of surface run-off will be greater in areas of heavy rainfall such as 
            the humid tropics. This is because, the raindrop impact is greater and pore spaces within the 
            soil are sealed. This reduces the infiltration capacity of the surface giving rise to more run
            off. 
             Duration of precipitation: Overland flow is greater during prolonged rainfall. This is 
            because the surface is sufficiently saturated with water that it can no longer take additional 
            precipitate rainwater. Conversely, more water infiltrates the soil when precipitation is short 
            leave, as the soils remain unsaturated.  
            IV. 
            Significance in the hydrological cycle  
            The significance of overland flow lies in the fact that it represents the link between surface 
            water storage and channel storage.

            Lesson 9: Soil Moisture Storage 
            I. Meaning  
            Generally, soil moisture is the water that is held in the spaces between soil particles.  Surface 
            soil moisture is the water that is in the upper 10cm of soil, whereas root zone soil moisture is 
            the water that is available to plants, which is generally considered to be in the upper 200cm of 
            soil. 
            II. Types of Water Associated with the Soil  
            Three basic types or forms of soil water have been distinguished: gravitational, capillary and 
            hygroscopic water. All these forms start as free water that is added to the soil by snow or rain. 
            Their final forms depend on the moisture conditions of the soil. Each type is controlled by a 
            different force and behaves differently in the soil.  
            1. Gravitational Water: This is water that occupies the macro pores in the soil during 
            rainfall and drains freely through the soil due to the force of gravity. It moves rapidly out of 
            well-drained soil and is not considered to be available to plants. It can cause upland plants 
            to wilt and die because gravitational water occupies air space, which is necessary to supply 
            oxygen to the roots. It drains out of the soil in 2-3 days. 
            2. Capillary Water: This is water that occupies the micro pores in the soil.  It is the soil 
            solution. Most, but not all of this water is available for plant growth. Capillary water is held 
            in the soil against the pull of gravity. Forces acting on capillary water are cohesion and 
            adhesion. Cohesion is attraction of water molecules to each other while adhesion is the 
            attraction of water molecules to the soil particles.  
            The amount of water held is a function of the pore size (cross-sectional diameter) and pore 
            space (total volume of all pores). This means that the tension (measured in bars) is increasing 
            as the soil dries out. 
            3. Hygroscopic Water: This is a thin film of water that is held tightly around clay particles 
            by surface tension. The water is held so tightly by the soil that it cannot be taken up by 
            roots. It is not held in the pores, but on the particle surface. This means clay will contain 
            much more of this type of water than sands because of surface area differences. 
            Hygroscopic water is held very tightly, by forces of adhesion. 
            Gravity is always acting to pull water down through the soil profile. However, the force of 
            gravity is counteracted by forces of attraction between water molecules and soil particles and 
            by the attraction of water molecules to each other.   
            III. 
            States of soil moisture (field capacity and wilting point) 
            1. Field capacity: It is the amount of soil moisture or water content held in the soil after 
            excess water has drained away and the rate of downward movement has decreased.  It 
            usually occurs 1-3 days after a rain. This would -1/3 bar. 
            2. Wilting point: This is soil moisture percentage at which plants cannot obtain enough 
            moisture to continue growing. This is -15bars. It is the limit beyond which plants cannot 
            access the moisture in the soil. 
            IV. 
            Measurement of soil moisture 
             Tensiometers: Tensiometers are devices that measure soil moisture tension. They are 
            sealed, water-filled tubes with a porous ceramic tip at the bottom and a vacuum gauge at 
            the top. They are inserted in the soil to plants' root zone depth. Water moves between the 
            tensiometer tip and surrounding soil until equilibrium is reached, and moisture tension 
            registers on the gauge at the top of the unit. Readings indicate water availability in the soil. 
            Tensiometers operate best at soil moisture tensions near field capacity and need to be 
            serviced before reuse if they dry out.   
             Electrical resistance blocks:  Also known as gypsum blocks, they measure soil water 
            tension. They consist of two electrodes embedded in a block of porous material, usually 
            gypsum; the electrodes are connected to lead wires that extend to the soil surface for 
            reading by a portable meter. As water moves in or out of the porous block in equilibrium 
            with the surrounding soil, changes in the electrical resistance between the two electrodes 
            occur. Resistance meter readings are converted to water tension using a calibration curve. 
            Gypsum blocks operate over a wider range of soil moisture tensions than tensiometers, but 
            tend to deteriorate over time and may even need to be replaced yearly 
             Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR): It is a newer tool that sends an electrical signal 
            through steel rods placed in the soil and measures the signal return to estimate soil water 
            content. Wet soil returns the signal more slowly than dry soil. This type of sensor gives 
            fast, accurate readings of soil water content, and requires little to no maintenance. 
            However, it does require more work in interpreting data, and may require special 
            calibration depending on soil characteristics. 
            V. 
            Factors affecting soil moisture  
            The following factors affect soil moisture: 
            33 | P a g e 
            1. Soil Texture: If a soil is dry, it will absorb water from incoming precipitation and not 
            release it until field capacity has been reached. This water is retained against gravity by the 
            surface tension of each soil particle in the capillary pores that separates them. Before water 
            can be released from the soil therefore, this capillary pores must be exceeded. In a finely 
            textured soil, composed mainly of clay, the small capillary pores may be so numerous that 
            field capacity will be considerable, much higher than in a freely draining sandy textured 
            soil. 
            2. Soil structure: As well as texture, storage is also affected by soil structure which is a 
            pattern of crumb sizes in the soil and how the constituent grains are agglomerated. Water 
            can be stored both within and between the crumbs, the development of which is partly 
            controlled by the amount of decaying organic matter, or humus, in the soil. 
            3. Drainage conditions:  some soils maybe permanently water logged, notably in areas of 
            marsh or peat bog, in which case their storage is a saturation capacity most of the time. 
            This means that not only the capillary pores but all the air voids are full too.  
            4. Vegetation cover: The ability of some soils to absorb water may be affected by vegetation 
            cover. Grassland has been seen to produce well balanced crumb structure which enable 
            drainage and retains moisture, whereas coniferous forest with their associated leaching and 
            acid humus are liable to encourage iron pans or hard impermeable layers beneath the 
            surface that impede drainage.  
            VI. 
            Significance of soil moisture  
            Soil moisture is a key variable in controlling the exchange of water and heat energy between 
            the land surface and the atmosphere through evaporation and plant transpiration. As a result, 
            soil moisture plays an important role in the development of weather patterns and the production 
            of precipitation. 
            Lesson 10: The Soil Moisture Budget 
            I. 
            Meaning 
            Soil moisture budget is the relationship between the water inputs and the water outputs in the 
            soil zone. These quantities vary during the course of the year such that there are periods of 
            excess soil moisture and periods of deficit. It is for this reason that John Smith and Roger Knill 
            (2009) define soil moisture budget as the seasonal pattern of water availability for plant 
            growth.  
            The main input of water in the soil is precipitation, while water is lost from the soil mainly 
            through evapotranspiration. Some of the precipitated water may not infiltrate the soil and rather 
            34 | P a g e 
            
            35 | Page 
            
            runs off the surface. Even infiltrated water can be lost from the soil to ground water store 
            below it via percolation. 
            II. Soil moisture Balance 
            Soil moisture budget depends on the balance between precipitation input and losses via 
            evapotranspiration and run off. This is expressed in the form of an equation as follows: 
            
            �
            �=𝑬+𝑮+𝑹 
            
            Where, P is precipitation, E represents Evapotranspiration, G is change in soil moisture storage 
            (which can be negative or positive) and R is Run off (by overland flow) or by percolation to 
            ground water further beneath.  
            The relationship between precipitation on the one hand and the other variables on the other 
            hand, result in three main theoretical soil moisture conditions namely: soil moisture surplus, 
            moisture utilization and moisture deficiency.  Added to these is moisture recharge.  This 
            balance is often shown in line form by using a line graph. Here, the monthly precipitation 
            pattern is plotted against potential evapotranspiration patterns.  
            Summarily, when PE exceeds P, there will be a phase when soil moisture is used up, after 
            which with the continued excess of PE over P, there will be a soil moisture deficit. This deficit 
            may be remedied if during wetter seasons P exceeds PE, thus inducing soil moisture recharge. 
            This may then be followed by a soil moisture surplus. A soil moisture budget tracks the inputs 
            and outputs of water in the soil. 
            III. Seasonal variations in Soil Moisture Budget  
            The soil moisture Budget situation is not the same in the Temperate and tropical climates. The 
            figure below shows the soil moisture budget in a cool temperate climate.       
            
            
            Soil moisture budget in cool temperate climate 
            In this climate, the soil moisture is rather highest in the winter months, when there is more 
            rain and lowest in the summer months when it is drier.  The driest month however is the month 
            of August. The soil moisture declines in half a year then takes half a year to increase.  
            In the tropical region, the situation is different as presented in the figure below  
            Soil moisture budget for Maroua, northern Cameroon 
             Conditions of moisture recharge 
            This occurs at the start of the next wet season. The first rains that infiltrate the soil (that is, that 
            do not get evaporated by the sun, used by plants or animals or run off to rivers) go to recharge 
            the pore spaces in the soil. This is known as the period of soil moisture recharge.  in the 
            equatorial region, the period of recharge stretches from February to march. In the northern part 
            of Cameroon, where the dry season is longer, it starts a little late from the June to August when 
            the overhead sun is at the tropic of cancer and the ITCZ with its rain belt has shifted north of 
            the equator. 
            36 | P a g e 
             Conditions of moisture surplus 
            This occurs when precipitation exceeds potential evapotranspiration and there is ample water to 
            sustain both runoff and plant growth. This occurs during the wet season, few months after the 
            start of this season. In the case of Maroua in North Cameroon, there is usually an excess of 
            rainfall over evaporation from August to September. There is soil moisture surplus. There is 
            plenty of water available to infiltrate the soil where it is available for plant growth. This 
            condition prevails further south in the equatorial region of Cameroon, during the rainy season, 
            between April and October. 
             Conditions of moisture utilisation  
            This is when plants are drawing water from the soil because precipitation is less than 
            evapotranspiration. This involves the use of surplus soil water which had been stored during 
            the period of very high precipitation. In the southern low plateau of Cameroon, the period is 
            quite brief, extending from mid –November to mid-January. In Maroua, this runs from 
            September to November. 
            IV. 
            Soil moisture regimes  
             Conditions of moisture Deficiency 
            During the dry season, there is an excess of evaporation over precipitation so little water 
            infiltrates the soil. Evaporation, combined with water being used by plants steadily reduces the 
            soil’s store of moisture until it is dry. From this point on, there is no moisture available for 
            plant growth and so most plants stop growing and enter a dormant period. This is known as the 
            period of soil moisture deficit. This generally prevails in areas where the dry season is long 
            such as in northern Cameroon. At the end of a brief rainy season, the soil moisture surplus is 
            easily used during the first months of the dry period, creating a deficiency later on because of 
            absence of precipitation and soil moisture.  
            In general, values of evapotranspiration increase toward the lower latitudes and decrease 
            towards the higher latitudes  
             Mediterranean climates: Found on the western sides of continents at latitude 30o to 45o, 
            the soil moisture regime shows that there is a large soil deficiency in summer when 
            temperatures are high and there is little or no rainfall. During this season, there is need for 
            crop irrigation else crops cannot grow.  Crops grown at this period must adapt to long 
            periods of drought.  In winter, there is more precipitation than evapotranspiration and so 
            there is a soil moisture recharge. But this is not sufficient to cause a surplus.  
             Equatorial climatic regions: Here, the soil moisture regime has a large water surplus. 
            Here, both precipitation and evapotranspiration are almost uniformly high throughout the 
            37 | P a g e 
            year but precipitation is higher in every month and soil moisture storage capacity is about 
            300mm. Plants grow at maximum rate in all months.  
             Tropical monsoon climates: With its distinct wet and dry seasons, soil moisture regime is 
            very contrasting. Where precipitation is absent usually from November to February, 
            evapotranspiration is high and there is severe soil moisture deficiency. But between June 
            and September, when precipitation is high, evapotranspiration is moderately high and there 
            is a water surplus. This is the time for growing crops.  
             Tropical desert climatic areas: Here, precipitation is almost absent in all months because 
            evapotranspiration is always high. As such, soil moisture deficiency prevails throughout the 
            year and soil moisture storage is close to zero at all times. This calls for heavy irrigation if 
            crops have to grow.  
            Lesson 11: Periodic variation in run-off 
            I. 
            Definition and scope:  
            Broadly speaking, run-off is the flow of water on the surface of the earth or under the ground 
            after infiltration. Excess storm water can flow on the surface as overland flow or in river 
            channels as channel flow (streams and rivers). It may also run horizontally within soil after 
            infiltration as through flow or within the rocks after percolation as base flow. Run-off therefore 
            constitutes an output process of the drainage basin. The major components of run-off therefore 
            include:  
             Overland flow (Hortonian overland flow and saturation overland flow). 
             Through flow 
             Baseflow  
             Channel flow  
            The first three flows eventually converge into a valley or channel to form channel flow. 
            Channel flow is the main medium by which water is carried away from the drainage basin into 
            the sea. (see surface runoff or overland flow in lesson 8. 
            A. Notion of channel run-off  
            Channel run off is the flow of water in valleys as streams or rivers. Any stream or river in the 
            town or village where you live is an example of channel run-off. At the same time, it is a store 
            in the hydrological cycle, (where water can be tapped for various uses).  
            A river’s channel refers to the entrenched part of the valley floor occupied either temporarily or 
            permanently and either in parts or in full, by flowing water of a river or stream. A river is 
            deemed to be bankfull when it is full to the top of its channel (banks) but not yet overflowing.  
            38 | P a g e 
            I. 
            Inputs and Outputs of Channel flow 
            Channel flow can be considered as an open system with inputs and outputs. These determine 
            the volume and speed of water flowing in the channel. The volume (discharge) and speed of 
            flow (velocity) are elements of channel flow characteristics. Others include type of flow and 
            efficiency. 
            a. Inputs of channel flow 
            Channels receive their input of water both from direct and indirect sources.  
             Directly, channels receive water from the atmosphere through precipitation that drops into 
            them. 
             Indirectly, channels receive water from other stores. These include water from soil store via 
            through flow and from ground water store via base flow.  
            b. Outputs of Channel flow  
             Water loss via direct evaporation to the atmosphere. 
             Water carried to stream via stream flow. 
            The balance between the inputs and outputs influence the channel flow characteristics.

            The major channel flow characteristics include the type of flow, discharge, velocity, load 
            shape/size and efficiency.  
            1. Type of flow: Based on the roughness or smoothness of water flow in a channel, two types 
            of flows have been distinguished namely; laminar and turbulent flows. 
             Laminar flow:  it is a type of flow in which each particle of a fluid follows a smooth path, 
            which never interferes with one another. This occurs over flat and horizontal channel 
            surface and where the velocity of the fluid is constant at any point in the fluid. 
            39 | P a g e 
             Turbulent flow: It is a type of flow in which the fluid particles move in a zig zag manner. 
            The fluid particles cross the paths of each other. This involves irregular flow that is 
            characterised by tiny whirl pool regions. This is common in rough channels and where the 
            velocity of the fluid varies significantly.   
            2.  Discharge: The volume of water that passes a point in a channel at a given time is known 
            as river’s discharge. It is measured in cumecs (cubic metres per second). The amount or 
            volume of water in a channel determines the rate of operation of erosional, transportational 
            and depositional processes. It is also important in assessing flood risk and control as well as 
            in dam construction/irrigation schemes. Generally, the higher the discharge, the higher will 
            be the rate of erosion in the channel.  
             River discharge (Q) can be calculated by multiplying cross-sectional are (A) and 
            Velocity (V). The formula is  
            Q=A x V 
             The cross sectional area is obtained by multiplying the depth of a channel by the 
            width of the channel.  
             Stream velocity is calculated by dividing the distance covered by a float by the time 
            it has taken to cover that distance. The formula is  
            Stream velocity =distance ÷ time    
            3. Stream velocity: This refers the speed at which water flows in the channel. This is 
            important in geomorphology because velocity affects the processes of erosion, 
            transportation and deposition. It is also important in river management schemes: dam 
            construction, flood risk assessment and control. 
            40 | P a g e 
            The speed of flow is not always the same within the channel. Isovels are lines joining areas of 
            equal stream velocity.  
            Generally, water closest to the bed and banks travels slowest due to frictional resistance, while 
            the fastest flow occurs nearest the centre and below the surface where both channel and air 
            friction are less. The zone of maximum velocity is thus found at the centre of the river or 
            stream.    
            Factors influencing stream velocity 
            i. 
            The shape of the channel: Generally, the zone of maximum velocity is in the centre of a 
            semi- circular channel where there is little or no frictional effect but in asymmetric 
            channels, maximum velocity is nearer the bank where the channel is deepest.  
            ii. 
            iii. 
            iv. 
            v. 
            The roughness of the channel: channels with boulders, projections and bends are 
            characterised by lower velocities due to increased frictional resistance as opposed to 
            smooth channels.  
            The gradient of the channel: The steeper the gradient or channel slope, the greater the 
            velocity. Steep gradients increase potential and kinetic energy.  
            The volume of water available in the channel: The greater the volume, the higher the 
            velocity and vice versa. 
            Meaning of storm Hydrograph 
            The depth of the channel: The deeper the channel, the greater the velocity due to reduced 
            frictional drag.  
            B. Periodic variations in Run-off  (Storm Hydrograph) 
            I. 
            A storm hydrograph is a graph on which river discharge or volume during a rain storm or run
            off event is plotted against time. It shows the discharge of a river as well as its total rainfall 
            over a period of time, before, during and after the storm. It thus shows the relationship between 
            precipitation and river discharge as a function of time.  
            When rain falls, the river responses to that input by a rise in its volume or discharge. The 
            hydrograph attempts to show how a stream responds following an input of precipitation. By 
            extension, it shows how quick input (precipitation) is converted into output (runoff). This is 
            useful in predicting the risk of floods.    
            Obviously, when rain falls, only a small percentage will fall into the channel directly. There is 
            often a lag time between the time that rain reaches the ground and its arrival in the channel. In 
            other words, there is a time gap between the occurrence of precipitation and the response of the 
            river to it. Lag time can therefore be defined as the time between the peak of a rainfall event 
            and the corresponding peak of the river discharge. Rainwater can be transferred from 
            surrounding surfaces to the channel in various ways at different times. The quickest means is 
            41 | P a g e 
            through overland flow, while through flow is slow due to friction caused by soil particles as the 
            water flows horizontally through it. Baseflow is the slowest means and is an ongoing process 
            since water is generally in the system. It is relatively stable because percolation of rain water to 
            underground water below from where it derives its water is very slow. Hence, baseflow does 
            not react to precipitation over the short run as run off.  
            Storm Hydrograph 
            II. 
            Characteristics of Storm Hydrographs  
             Rising limb: This indicates the beginning and progressive rise in the discharge of the 
            stream during or after precipitation. 
             Peak discharge: It tells us what time there as the maximum level of discharge by a river. It 
            represents the maximum point on the graph that shows the highest discharge of water in the 
            channel during or after a rainfall event. Some hydrographs may have two peaks.  A smaller 
            peak which is known as blip peak may arise from direct channel precipitation before run 
            off produces the main peak. A double peak may also occur if rain storm itself has two 
            peaks, or in another extreme, when a dam collapses to release more water after the storm 
            has produced the first peak.  
             Falling or recession limb: It shows the progressive decline or reduction in a river’s 
            discharge after the peak has been passed. The gradient of this limb is usually less steep than 
            the rising limb. This is because the channel is continuously being fed with water from 
            surface storages such as from lakes and potholes that were sufficiently filled during the 
            rainfall event to be discharging later. 
            42 | P a g e 
             Lag time: It is the time difference between the occurrence of maximum rainfall and 
            maximum discharge. 
             The storm: It refers to heavy precipitation and represented by a small by a small 
            histogram. This indicates the peak rain fall, which is the time where there was maximum 
            rainfall. 
             Baseflow: It is the natural background flow from ground water store. It represents the 
            release from storage of previous rainfall. In the diagram, the base flow is the hypothetical 
            quantity during the time of the storm flow. Baseflow is relatively stable because  
            i. 
            Percolation of rain to water table below and underground storage  is very slow, likewise, 
            output from the store due to frictional resistance to movement or circulation beneath the 
            surface. 
            ii. 
            Moreover, only a small proportion of storm infiltrates. Thus, baseflow does not react to 
            precipitation over the short run as runoff. 
             Bankfull: A river is deemed to be bankfull when it is full to the top of its channel (banks), 
            but not yet overflowing. Measurement of bankfull is by no means straight forward because 
            the following  
            i. 
            Its occurrence is rare 
            ii. 
            iii. 
            III. 
            Its flow is torrential  
            Types of Hydrographs  
            Many channels are so irregular that it is not actually easy to tell when the bankfull stage 
            has been reached. 
            A distinction can be made between sharp-peak (flashy peak), subdued peak and double peak 
            hydrographs  
            a. Flashy peak Hydrograph: A flashy peak hydrograph rises steeply to a higher peak with a 
            short lag time. This implies that the river’s response to precipitation is rapid and is liable to 
            floods. 
            43 | P a g e 
            Flashy peak hydrograph 
            b. Subdued-peak Hydrograph: It rises gently to a much lower peak. It has a long time lag 
            implying the river’s response to precipitation is much delayed with reduced flood risk. 
            Subdued peak Hydrograph  
            c. Double peak Hydrograph: This is a hydrograph with two peaks, usually one main peak 
            and one smaller peak.

            Blip peak 
            Blip peak hydrograph 
            The smaller peak is often called a blip peak and can result from the following:  
             Direct precipitation in the channel might produce a first peak before run off from 
            surrounding areas accumulate to yield the main peak. 
             Collapse of a dam after heavy down pours 
             When rain occurs twice.     
            IV. 
            Flood Prediction from Storm Hydrographs  
            The importance of the storm Hydrograph lies in the fact that it provides a more useful l record 
            from which it is possible to predict potential floods by showing how quickly and how fast a 
            river is going to rise under a particular set of conditions after precipitation. It is therefore a 
            useful guide in designing flood control policy. The information from the hydrograph that can 
            assist in flood control in a river basin includes;  
             The peak discharge, whether sharp or subdued. 
             Lag time whether short or long  
             The gradient of the rising and recession limbs 
            V. 
            Factors affecting the shape of storm Hydrographs.  
            Different drainage basins do have different storm Hydrographs.  These variations can be 
            attributed to a number of factors.  These factors can be grouped into two as dynamic factors 
            and static factors or catchment/basin characteristics. These factors operate together in various 
            combinations over space and time. 
            A. Dynamic or Transient factors  
            The dynamic factors are those that are subjected to frequent changes. This relates largely to 
            climate (especially precipitation) and land use. 
            45 | P a g e 
            1. Precipitation: The precipitation characteristics that cause differences in the shape of 
            hydrographs or lag time are its form, intensity and duration  
             Form: If precipitation falls and persists in the form of snow, it will be held in store thereby 
            extending lag time and producing subdued peaks to hydrographs. But should a marked 
            thaw set in, then much water will be suddenly released, thereby reducing lag time, 
            producing sharp peak hydrographs and increasing the risk of flooding. This is associated 
            with the mid and high latitude regions. 
            Basins experiencing precipitation in the form of rain like in the tropical region are likely to 
            exhibit reduced lag time and sharp peak hydrograph, all things being equal. This is because in 
            liquid form, water drains quickly into the channel (provided the soil and rocks are 
            impermeable, the slopes are steep and the vegetation cover is less dense.  
             Precipitation intensity: It relates to the amount of precipitation occurring within a given 
            period of time. High intensity will result in sharp peak hydrographs because soil pores are 
            blocked by rain drop impact and more runoff is generated. 
             Duration: This relates to how long the precipitation occurs. At the beginning of the storm, 
            more water rather infiltrates resulting in subdued peak hydrographs, while at the middle 
            and end of the storm, the ground is sufficiently soaked to be releasing more of runoff 
            leading to sharp peak hydrographs.  
             Frequency may also be another factor, which is the rate of occurrence of a specific type of 
            rainstorm. The more frequent, the quicker the response leading to sharp peak hydrographs. 
            2. Land use: The use of land within the drainage basin varies enormously. This embodies 
            removal of vegetation, planting of trees, agricultural activities, urbanisation and even 
            damming or rivers. These invariably affect lag time and the nature of storm Hydrographs 
            produced.  
             Removal of vegetation (deforestation) would reduce infiltration and increase runoff. This 
            would reduce lag time and produce sharp peak hydrographs.  
             Tree planting in the basin would increase infiltration rate and reduce runoff. This would 
            increase lag time and produce subdued peak hydrographs.  
             Farming in the basin involving tilling and ploughing would increase infiltration and reduce 
            runoff leading to subdued peak hydrographs. 
             Urban centres with their corrugated iron sheets, tarred or cemented surfaces and extensive 
            network of culvets increase runoff during storms. This is because the paved surfaces do not 
            permit infiltration. This reduces lag time and produce flashy peak hydrographs compared 
            with those in rural areas. 
            46 | P a g e 
            In rural areas, much water rather infiltrates into the un-cemented surfaces. This slows run-off 
            and the amount of water that reaches the channel. 
             Dam construction tends to reduce the effect of rainstorm on river discharge downstream. 
            They contain excess runoff and slows the response of the river downstream to input of 
            precipitation. This results in reduced lag time and subdued peak hydrographs.  
            B. Static factors: Catchment or Basin Characteristics  
            These factors are permanent and relate to the characteristics of the drainage basin. These 
            include basin slope or gradient, basin size and shape, basin’s geology (nature of basin’s soil 
            and rocks) and drainage density.  
            1. Basin slope or gradient: Generally, basins with steep slopes exhibit sharp-peak 
            hydrographs with shorter lag times than their gently sloping counterparts. This stems from 
            the fact that steep slopes possess a greater gravitational force that increases runoff and 
            reduces infiltration. The amount of rainfall delayed by storage will be less and much of the 
            water that reaches the surface is rapidly transferred into the river channel via surface runoff. 
            This reduces time lag and produces a limb which rises steeply to a sharp peak. 
            By contrast, river basins characterised by gentler or flatter slopes are associated with subdued 
            peak hydrographs, longer lag time and gently rising limb. This arises from the fact that such 
            gentle slopes experience high rates of infiltration, which delays the transfer of water to the 
            channel. Hence, the response of the river to rainfall is more staggered.  
            2. Rock type and soil type: Basins characterised with impermeable soils such as clay soils 
            and impermeable rocks give rise to sharp-peak hydrographs and shorter lag time than river 
            basins associated with permeable or porous soils and rocks. This is because impermeable 
            surfaces impede infiltration and percolation. Much of the rain water that reaches the surface 
            is rather quickly evacuated through surface runoff into the river channel. Consequently, the 
            river rises steeply to a sharp peak within a short time lag.  
            This is in contrast to basins with sandy soils and jointed and porous rocks which allow a great 
            deal of water to enter the soil and rocks. This delays the transfer of water to the channel. The 
            response of the river is slow, rising very gently over a long lag time into a subdued peak. 
            Examples abound in limestone regions. 
            3. Vegetation cover: River basins with dense vegetation cover are associated with long lag 
            time and subdued peak hydrographs. This would be the case with river basins in the 
            tropical rainforest region if other factors were to be held constant. This is because much of 
            the rainwater is intercepted by the vegetation canopy. Secondly, the roots of the plants 
            create openings in the soil which increase infiltration rate. This delays the transfer of water 
            into the channel.  
            47 | P a g e 
            On the contrary, drainage basins characterised with a sparse or low vegetation cover are 
            associated with short lag time and sharp peak hydrographs in the event of rainfall. A greater 
            proportion of the rain water is not intercepted nor infiltrates. This allows for much runoff into 
            channels within a short spell. The response of the river is rapid, as discharge rises steeply to a 
            sharp peak. 
            4. Basin shape: Drainage basins vary in their shapes and so do their lag times and shape of 
            storm hydrographs. Circular basins are associated with sharp peak hydrographs as the 
            distance that water has to flow to discharge point from basin is equal in all directions. 
            Consequently, water will arrive from all sources at roughly the same time.  
            In elongated basins, the arrival of water will be much more staggered or dispersed. This is 
            because the distance from source to the discharge point varies enormously. The response of the 
            river is therefore slow, increasing lag time and resulting in subdued peak hydrographs. 
            5. Basin size: Gently rising hydrographs and extended lag times are likely to occur in large 
            catchment areas. This is because the possible sources of runoff are so scattered that water 
            will take a considerable time to drain from them to the river channel.  
            Hydrographs constructed from small-sized catchment areas are likely to have steep rising 
            limbs, sharp peaks and short lag time as possible runoff sources are closer to the channel. To 
            this effect, rain water that reaches the surface will arrive the river channel from all sources 
            within a short time to increase the discharge.  
            6. Drainage Density: This relates to the number of streams in a particular drainage basin and 
            can be measured by dividing total length of all streams in a basin (L) by its area (A). 
            Drainage density is important as it affects flow characteristics and hence the nature of storm 
            hydrographs. As a rule, the higher the drainage density (D) the more quickly water drains to a 
            river. High drainage density removes surface runoff very rapidly decreases the lag time, 
            thereby increasing the magnitude of the peak of the storm hydrograph. The following classes of 
            drainage density have been distinguished:  
            i. 
            ii. 
            iii. 
            iv. 
            Coarse, DD<5km length per km2 area 
            Medium, DD=5-10 km/km2 
            Fine, DD=10-20km/km2 
            Very fine, DD>20km/km2 
            A distinction can therefore be made between coarse (scattered tributaries), medium, fine and 
            superfine textured densities. For example, super fine density means faster respond to storm 
            rains.

            Lesson 12: Long Term or Seasonal Variations in runoff 
            River Regimes or Regimes of Runoff 
            I. 
            Meaning of river regime 
            The regime of a river refers to the fluctuations of its discharge over a period of time, usually a 
            year. It thus describes the seasonal variations in the volume of water or discharge in a river. 
            These are “annual hydrographs” showing the river discharge (usually measured in cumecs) 
            plotted against time (in months across the year.  
            Generally, high waters are experienced in the wet season, while low waters occur during the 
            dry season. River regimes are conventionally represented via the use of line graphs or bar 
            graphs. However, river regimes should not be confused with hydrographs. Although both 
            involve fluctuations in discharge, regimes differ from hydrographs in terms of timing. While 
            regimes are annual fluctuations in discharge, hydrographs are graphs which show hourly 
            variations. Besides, controls on the regime are less localised than those on the storm 
            hydrographs.  
            Knowledge of the regime of a river is important in controlling possible floods, storing up water 
            for irrigation and human consumption and in planning hydro-electric production. 
            II. 
            Types of River Regime 
            Regimes vary from one drainage basin to another. Different types can be recognised. One 
            classification is based on climatic types or zones, because the regimes follow climatic cycles or 
            seasons. Accordingly, a distinction can be made between tropical, temperate and polar regimes 
            on a global scale.  
            A common and convenient classification is on the basis of the number of high waters or peaks 
            and lows that occur in the course of the year, that is, the pattern of fluctuation. On this basis R. 
            Padre, in his work “Fleuve et Riviere” classifies regimes into three groups: simple regime, 
            regime of the first degree of complexity (double regime) and those of second degree of 
            complexity also referred to as complex regimes. 
            1. Simple regime  
            This is a type of regime whereby the rivers have one period of high flow and one period of low 
            water in the course of the year. Within a period of time, there is only one pattern and 
            distinction of high/low water discharge. That is, high discharge is followed by lower levels of 
            discharge. Examples of rivers exhibiting one peak in Cameroon are the Wouri, Dibamba and 
            Manyu. High water occurs during the rainy season with the peak in September, while low 
            water occurs during the season of limited rainfall, the lowest discharge often recorded in 
            January. Examples outside Cameroon include the Yangtze and Volga rivers in Russia.

            Simple regime 
            2. Double Regimes 
            This is also referred to as the regime of first order of complexity. In this category,  the rivers 
            exhibit two distinct periods of high waters. This is associated with rivers of the equatorial areas 
            with a double rainfall maxima corresponding to the equinoxes. The rivers Amazon and Congo 
            are good examples. In the temperate region, it may also arise from summer snow melt and 
            autumn -winter rain, with a good example being the river Garonne in France. In Cameroon, the 
            rivers which flow south of the country such as Rivers Nyong, Ntem, Kienke, Lokoundje, Dja 
            and Boumba have double regimes, which coincide with the two maxima (two rainy seasons): 
            small one from April to June and the big one in October to November. These rivers also 
            experience two seasons of low waters: during the small dry season between July and August 
            and the big dry season from December to March. In Cameroon, this is described as the true 
            equatorial regime.

            Double regime 
            3. Complex regimes: Also referred to as regimes of the second degree of complexity, 
            complex regimes are regimes with several peaks in the course of the year. This is 
            characteristic of rivers which cover very extensive areas cutting across different climatic 
            zones or which receive many tributaries from various sources, with each portraying a 
            different regime. Most of the world’s largest or longest rivers such as the Nile, Mississippi, 
            Rhine and Danube fall in this category.   
            Numerous peaks and lows  
            Complex regime 
            III. 
            Factors affecting River Regimes  
            The regime of a river will depend on a number of factors, such as the seasonal distribution of 
            precipitation (both snow and rain), the nature of the rocks, the size of the catchment area and 
            the vegetation cover, influence of glaciers or snow fields, large surface storages along rivers 
            and human action or land use.  
            1. Climatic factor: This is one of the important controls on the type of regime. Climate 
            affects river regimes directly and indirectly. The direct effect is through the amount, nature 
            and distribution of precipitation, while the indirect effect is through its influence on 
            temperature and evapotranspiration. 
            The amount and distribution of precipitation in the course of the year vary from one climatic 
            region to another. Where there is just one wet and one dry season like in the tropical 
            continental climatic region, simple regimes are common. But where there are two or more 
            periods of maximum precipitation like in the equatorial climatic region, double or complex 
            regimes are common.  
            In Mediterranean climates, the river discharge is highest in the winter months, when there is 
            more rain and lowest in the summer months when it is drier.  
            2. The size of the catchment area: A very large catchment area such as that of Niger benefits 
            from rainfall occurring in different parts of the basin at different times. This results in 
            complex regimes exhibiting numerous peaks and lows in the course of the year. The Niger, 
            which is 4160km long, passes through nearly all the climate zones of West Africa from a 
            wet region through a semi-desert into a wet climate again. Rivers flowing across vast 
            regions with different climates tend to have complex regimes. This is the case of the 
            51 | P a g e 
            Mississippi and  Danube. Rivers in small catchment areas on other hand may yield only one 
            peak in response to the restricted climatic cycle of the area.  
            3. Geology of the Basin: Geology also has an effect on river regimes. Areas with 
            impermeable rocks at the surface will ahve more streams (higher drainage density) and will 
            be more prone to flooding or fluctuations in discharge as there is less ground water storage.  
            This is associated with complex regimes. This is because the impermeable rocks reduce the 
            rate of infiltration but encourage runoff which usually affects river discharge.  
            By contrast, rivers running over permeable rocks will be more likely to dry up during droughts 
            as water will be stored as ground water. This simplifies the regime. Similarly, areas with 
            permeable rocks are associated with low discharge as more water infiltrates. The infiltrated 
            water may further percolate and help to recharge groundwater and ensure regular flow of 
            streams, which results in simple regimes. 
            4. Vegetation: Vegetation can cause seasonal fluctuations in river discharge. Some rivers in 
            temperate regions such as the rivers Seine and Saone rather witness the lowest discharge in 
            summer irrespective of the summer rains. This is because of greater soil moisture 
            utilization by vegetation whose demand during this period of growth is high. This is further 
            compounded by the fact that, water is lost to the atmosphere through transpiration. This 
            results in low waters in summer and rather high waters in winter which is associated with a 
            simple regime. Un-vegetated areas tend to have complex regimes as more runoff is 
            generated whenever intense rainfall occurs.  
            5. The influence of glacier or snow fields: Some rivers in the mid and high latitudes are fed 
            by glaciers or snow. The discharge tends to be low during winter when low temperatures 
            cause water to freeze but high during summer or late spring when melting occurs. This 
            produces simple regimes with a winter low and summer high. This is the case of rivers such 
            as  Rivers Durance and Rhone in the Tundra and Alpine regions. 
            6. Influence of large surface storage along rivers: The presence of natural retention 
            reservoirs such as lakes along rivers tends to affect river regimes. Such storages tend to 
            retain much water during periods of heavy precipitation, which result in insignificant 
            fluctuations in the course of the year. The discharge tends to be flattened or regular. This 
            makes the regime less complex. Examples of such natural water storages that exist along 
            rivers are Lake Geneva along River Rhine and the Great Lakes along the St Lawrence in 
            USA. 
            7. Land use and River Management: There are a number of ways in which human activity 
            can affect river regimes: 
            52 | P a g e 
             Water extraction for irrigation farming affects river regimes. Farmers use groundwater for 
            irrigation. In some parts of the world, this has had a significant impact on the volume of 
            water stored in aquifers and affecting the level of base flow-in dry conditions when the 
            river is mainly fed by ground water. During the dry season in Cameroon, farmers extract 
            more water from rivers to irrigate crops but this would affect the river regime.  
             In urban areas, rivers are more intensively managed to prevent flooding and to make use of 
            water resources. The development of impermeable surfaces through buildings and tarmac 
            and the installation of storm drains can increase river discharge when rain falls. This results 
            in complex regimes. 
             River management: Dam building has the most significant impact on the regime of a 
            river. Following the construction of a dam, the downstream flow of water in the river is 
            controlled and rarely affected by seasonal changes in precipitation or melt water. Dams 
            tend to flatten out the annual hydrograph. People also affect discharge by changing the 
            channel: straightening meanders, deepening the channel, and canalising it to increase the 
            velocity. Any form of river management has an impact on the regime of the river.

            II. 
            Meaning of Basin Morphometry  
            Basin Morphometry is used to refer to the modern techniques of describing drainage basins 
            based on measurements. The significance lies in the fact that it enables different basins to be 
            described and compared accurately without subjectivity.  
            Morphometry actually means measurement of shape or form. These involve measurements or 
            calculations of various elements or characteristics of the drainage basin such as the stream 
            length, surface area of the basin, stream ranking and many others. 
            Identification of Drainage Network Characteristics  
            The major morphometric techniques include drainage density, stream ordering, bifurcation 
            ration and drainage basin area.  
            A. Drainage Density  
            This is the most widely used morphometric technique. Drainage density is defined as the 
            total     
            length of all the streams and rivers in a drainage basin divided by the total area of the 
            drainage basin.  It is the ratio of the length of all the streams in a given river system to the 
            catchment area drained by that river system or a measure of the extent of the drainage net, that 
            is the dissection of the land surface by streams. It is thus the average length of channel or 
            55 | P a g e 
            stream per unit area of the basin’s surface. This shows how poorly a watershed is drained by 
            stream channels.  
            Calculation of drainage density 
            The total  length of all the stream channels is measured from a map (L) and divided by the 
            drainage basin area (A). The answer is expressed in kilometres per square kilometres. 
            Horton’s formula for calculating drainage density is expressed as  
            D=∑L/A 
            Where D is the drainage density, L is the length of stream channel and A is the area of the 
            drainage basin.  
            Example    
            In an imaginary basin with a total channel length of 275km and a total area of 120km2, the 
            drainage density is:  
            D= 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑚 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ (𝐿)
            𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐷𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 (𝐴)
            =275÷120 =2.3 km per km2 
            This means that for every one square kilometre of the basin’s area, there is a channel length of 
            2.3km 
            In practice, the necessary material to carry out this measurement is often not available, and 
            only quantitative estimates can be made.  
            Types or classes of drainage density 
            Drainage density is quite low or high in some areas and medium in other areas. A distinction 
            can therefore be made between high, medium or moderate and low drainage densities. The 
            technical terms often employed to describe the different classes of density are coarse (scattered 
            or few streams or tributaries with DD<5 km length per km2 area), medium with DD=5
            10km/km2, fine with DD=10-20km/km2 and superfine or ultra fine textured densities with 
            DD>20km/km2. 
            1. Low drainage density or coarse-textured drainage density: It is one where the basin or 
            main stream has very limited number of tributaries due to higher rate if infiltration into 
            coarse-textured geological base material of the drainage basin during a rainstorm. This 
            occurs in areas with permeable rock, for e.g. chalk, much vegetation cover limited rainfall, 
            gentle slopes, lower channel frequency.  
            56 | P a g e 
            2. Medium drainage density or medium textured density: It contains intermediate streams 
            within the drainage basin but not many. It occurs in areas of moderate erosion, maybe 
            underlained by sand and receives adequate rainfall. 
            3. High drainage density: It is fine-textured drainage density characterised by a large 
            number of small streams which are in the form of short subsequent streams. The catchment 
            area is therefore relatively well drained. High density occurs in areas which are associated 
            with impermeable land surface, steep slopes. Limited vegetation cover, heavy rainfall, fine 
            textured soils or rocks, large channel frequency (tributaries). 
            4. Extremely high drainage density: commonly described as superfine drainage density, it is 
            one in which the drainage basin contains high number of tributaries and distributaries. It 
            occurs in areas which tend to suffer much erosion or denudation so that the land is widely 
            excavated. E.g. the degraded badlands of New Jersey in USA.  
            Factors affecting drainage density 
            Drainage density varies from one basin to another due to a number of factors. Drainage 
            density depends on both climate and physical characteristics of the drainage basin. These 
            include geology and soil, relief, precipitation, time and land use.  
            1. Climatic factor: The primary elements are precipitation and temperature. The amount and 
            type of precipitation influence directly the quantity and character of runoff. In areas where 
            precipitation comes largely as thunder showers, a large percentage of the rainfall will 
            runoff immediately and more surface drainage lines will be formed. Higher temperatures 
            result in high evapotranspiration and loss of water, which result in the creation of few 
            stream channels, thereby resulting in low drainage density.  
            2. Vegetation factor: The amount and kind of vegetation growing affects surface water 
            runoff and thus vegetation density. Drainage density tends to be high where vegetation 
            cover is lacking as infiltration reduces leading to more runoff which creates more streams. 
            In vegetated areas, there is more infiltration through the pores created by the rooting system 
            and decaying vegetal matter, which reduces runoff.  
            3. Nature of surface: Drainage density is greatly affected by the infiltration capacity of the 
            bedrock. It is commonly observed that drainage lines are more numerous over impermeable 
            materials than over permeable ones. Soil permeability and underlying rock type affect the 
            run off in a watershed; impermeable ground or exposed bedrock will lead to an increase in 
            surface water runoff and therefore  to more frequent streams. 
            4. Relief or topography: Drainage density is also affected by the initial relief or the vertical 
            distance from the initial upland flats to the levels of adjacent graded valleys. Rugged 
            57 | P a g e 
            regions or those with high relief will have a higher drainage density than other drainage 
            basins if the other characteristics of the basin are the same. 
            5. Land use: As for land use, there are many variants with different impacts on drainage 
            density. In general, any land use that results in the reduction of the vegetation cover and a 
            more compact surface is associated with more runoff, thereby creating more channels and 
            increasing drainage density. This is the case with deforestation and urbanisation. The tarred 
            surfaces in urban areas generate more runoff which result in more streams and higher 
            drainage density than in rural areas where the tilling of the soil for agricultural purposes 
            rather encourages infiltration, which reduces runoff and little or no channels are created. 
            B. Stream frequency  
            Stream frequency is the count of all stream segments per unit area of a basin. It is a 
            measure of topographic texture based on the ratio of the number of stream segments per 
            unit area of the basin. Thus, it is an index which attempts to quantify the density of natural 
            drainage in a catchment, and is derived by counting the number of stream junctions within 
            a catchment and dividing by the catchment area in square kilometres.  
            F=N/A 
            Where, F=stream frequency (total number of channels per unit area);  
            N=Number of channels of all stream orders 
            A=Basin area.  
            C. Stream Ordering 
            It describes the texture of a stream network and strongly reflects bedrock properties (strength, 
            fracture density, infiltration, mass wasting tendencies) and/or those of surficial material 
            properties if thick (i.e. deep till deposits). Comparisons of basin frequency can be made for 
            basins that are underlain by different bedrock types. 
            This is another method of morphometric analysis used to describe and to compare drainage 
            systems or networks. It involves giving numbers to the different tributaries in a river basin on 
            the basis of their position in the basin. That is, ranking of streams in hierarchy; as first, second, 
            third and so on depending on their position within a drainage basin. This is done by giving 
            numbers to each channel segment. The channel segments embody the tributaries and sub 
            tributaries. On the basis of the order of the truck stream or river arrived at the end of the 
            ranking, the drainage basin can be described variously as a third order or fourth or fifth order 
            drainage basin.  
            Three ways of ordering streams can be distinguished proposed by Strahler, Shreve and Horton.  
            58 | P a g e 
            a. Strahler’s method of stream ordering  
            Of all, Strahler’s stream ordering is widely used because of its simplicity. In the scheme 
            proposed by A.N. Strahler, all stream segments without tributaries stretching from the stream’s 
            source to their junctions with others are designated as first order streams. When two first order 
            streams join, the segment downstream becomes the second order, and when two second order 
            streams join, they form a third order and so on until the order of the trunk or main stream is 
            arrived at the confluence where the order changes is known as the point of promotion.  
            To avoid confusion in ranking, note that it requires two stream segments of equal order to join 
            to produce a segment of higher order. Hence, the order remains unchanged if a lower order 
            segment joins a higher order segment. For example, if a second order tributary stream in the 
            course of flow is joined further downstream by a first order segment, it still remains a second 
            order stream (point of no promotion) 
            Strahler’s method  
            b. Shreve’s method of Stream Ordering  
            In Shreve’s ordering of streams, the ranking is done by adding the streams order that join at a 
            confluence to get the order or number of the next segment downstream that receives them. 
            Accordingly, two first order streams would join to form a second order, while two second order 
            streams sum up to form a fourth order segment and so on till the trunk order is obtained. 
            59 | P a g e 
            Shreve’s method  
            c. Horton’s Ordering System 
            Horton’s ordering system is the most complex. He first identifies the maximum stream 
            segment and extends it further to its source, following the segment that is fairly straight 
            in relation to it. This is repeated for the next major segments. Thus, fingertip or initial 
            un-branched source tributaries are not necessarily first order streams as in Strahler’s 
            method.  
            Horton’s meth 
            Irrespective of the method used, stream ordering provides data that can be used to describe and 
            to compare different drainage basins. For example, one can be described as a fourth order basin 
            while another is a second or third order basin without any subjectivity.  For practical purposes, 
            Strahler’s method is highly recommended for its simplicity.   
            D. Bifurcation Ratio 
            Another morphometric index of a network is the bifurcation ratio. Bifurcation simply means 
            forking or branching and is a measure of the amount of branching (tributaries) that occurs in a 
            60 | P a g e 
            network. It can be worked out after stream ordering or numbering has been done, using 
            preferably Strahler’s method.  It is simply the ratio of the number of streams of one order to the 
            number of streams of the next higher order.  To calculate the bifurcation ratio of the basin, the 
            following steps should be taken:  
             First rank the streams in the basin, using preferably Strahler’s method of stream ordering. 
             Count the number of streams of each order. 
             Establish a frequency table following the sample below in which you record the number of 
            streams that occur in each order. 
             From the figure illustrating strahler’s method, the frequency table for the river is shown 
            below 
            Stream order  
            Number of streams

            4  
            Third order  
            1  
             Find out the bifurcation ratio of each stream order by dividing the number of streams in one 
            order by the number of streams in the next higher order. 
             Proceed to find out the mean or average bifurcation ratio of the drainage basin by adding all 
            the sub bifurcation ratios obtained and dividing the sum by the number of ratios added.  
            Example: 
            In the table above, the bifurcation ratio for each order is as follows:  
            Ratio first order: second order =10 ÷ 4 =2.5  
            Ratio second order: third order= 4 ÷ 1 =4  
            Sum of all bifurcation ratios in the drainage basin is 2.5 + 4 =6.5 
            Average bifurcation ratio of the whole basin is 6.5÷ 2 =3.25  
            The bifurcation ratios of most streams are between 3 and 5.  
            The significance of the bifurcation ratio is that it provides information that can be used to 
            gauge the likelihood of flooding within the basin and even for parts of the basin. The lower the 
            Br the higher is the risk of flooding and vice versa.  
            E. Sinuosity Index  
            It is the application of quantitative analysis to the river channel itself (and not to the entire 
            basin as with the other morphometric techniques). You can be asked to calculate the sinuosity 
            index of a given river or stream along its whole course or between two specified points along 
            the river’s course. The degree of sinuosity indicates the degree of meandering. Meanders are 
            61 | P a g e 
            
            62 | Page 
            
            the curving bends in a river channel. A river is said to be meandering when its sinuosity index 
            exceeds 1.5. The value 1.5 is therefore the basis for judging whether a river’s course is 
            meandering or straight. The sinuosity ratio is obtained by dividing the distance between two 
            points along the course of a river by the straight-line distance between them.  
            To determine the sinuosity index, the following steps should be taken: 
             Identify the two points along the river whose sinuosity index is required. 
             Measure the length of the river between the two points following the bends. 
             Measure the straight-line distance between the two points. 
             Work out the sinuosity index using the formula  
            
            Sinuosity Index = 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔 𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟 
            �
            �𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡−𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒 𝑑𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 
            
             Draw a conclusion on the basis of the answer obtained as follows: if the answer obtained 
            exceeds 1.5, then the river is flowing in a meandering course. If it is less than 1.5. then the 
            river or channel is straight. A result of 1 would mean that the course is virtually straight

            III. Drainage morphometric laws   
            Certain interesting relationships have emerged between stream order and other measurable 
            variables such as stream number, stream length, drainage basin area and even stream slope or 
            gradient. Some of which have been conceptualised into laws called laws of Morphometry.  
            a. Stream order and stream number: The number of stream segments or tributaries 
            decreases with increase in stream order.  There is therefore an inverse relationship between 
            stream order and number. This simply means that, in any drainage basin, there are more of 
            lower order streams to higher order ones. For example, there are more first order streams 
            than second order streams, more second order than third order etc.  This is Horton’s first 
            law of Morphometry known as the law of stream numbers which states that within a 
            drainage basin, a constant geometric relationship exists between stream order and stream 
            number. If plotted on a graph, a straight line sloping downward from left to right results. 
            b. Stream order and stream length: The higher the stream order, the greater is the length of 
            the stream forming a straight linear graph. This is Horton’s second law of Morphometry. It 
            portrays a positive relationship. First order segments are the shortest in any basin and the 
            segments become longer and longer as stream order increases.  
            c. Stream order and area of drainage basin: There is also a positive relationship between 
            the two. Meaning that as stream order increases, the larger is the basin area drained. If the 
            areas of the drainage basins of the streams in each other are measured, and plotted against 
            63 | P a g e 
            stream order, they will be found to have a straight line relationship. This is the third law of 
            Morphometry known as the law of basin area.

            RIVERINE FEATURES 
            Success criteria: 
             Identify riverine features on a topographic map 
            Drainage pattern 
            There are four types 
            a. Dendritic 
            b. Radial 
            c. Trellis

            i. 
            ii.  
            Dendritic drainage pattern 
            The tributaries appear like the veins of 
            a leaf and connects to the main stream 
            at an acute angle 
            Such a pattern normally develops on a 
            landform that has uniform resistance to 
            erosion 
            See below 
            radial pattern 
            the tributaries emerge from one central place and 
            run down a highland like spokes of a bicycle wheel, 
            the high ground may appear like a water-shade 
            iii. 
            Trellis (rectangular) 
            Tributaries meet the main 
            stream at almost right 
            angles 
            It normally develop on an 
            area that has alternate 
            resistance to erosion and 
            the streams are formed 
            along the soft rocks

            The tributaries or streams appear and 
            disappear underground 
            The pattern normally develops in swampy 
            areas  
            COASTAL FEATURES 
            Success criteria: 
             Identifying coastal features on a topographic map 
            Coastal Features 
            These are features that are found along the coast or water bodies (sea, oceans or lakes) caused by 
            water movements such as:- 
             Lagoons, Estuary, Delta,  Peninsula, Spit, Bay, Headland, Cape,  Strait, Isthmus 
             Bay  
            Its’ an indentation in the coastline e.g Nkhata bay, Monkey bay 
             Spit 
            Its an area of the coastal water where gravel, sand, mud and other materials are deposited 
            from the sea 
             Headlands 
            It’s an area of high land that is extending out into a sea or lake 
            It is caused by hard bedrock that is not eroded by actions of water waves 
            Page 8 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
             Lagoon 
            It’s a shallow stretch of water which is partly or completely separated from the 
            Sea or lake by a narrow strip of land e.g Chia lagoon in Nkhotakota 
            Lagoons are normally formed due to the action of spit across part of a lake or water  
            Body 
             Isthmus 
            It’s a narrow neck or strip of land areas e.g Isthmus of Suez connects Africa and Asia 
             Strait 
            It is a narrow stretch of water which connects two larger bodies of water e.g the Strait 
            of Gibraltar Connects Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea 
             Peninsula  
            It’s a piece of land that is almost surrounded by water  
            Cape: 
            It’s a smaller headland extending 
            into the sea or lake e.g Cape 
            Maclear, Cape town

            Success criteria:- 
             Measuring distance between points 
             Calculating area on a map 
             Draw cross-sections and river profiles 
             Reduce and enlarge maps 
             Calculate gradient 
            a) Measuring distance 
            Measuring of distance on a map can be done using the following instruments 
             String 
             Ruler 
             Straight edged paper 
             Pairs of divider 
             Pairs of campus 
            The distance is measured following a road or river in all meanders 
            The measured distance is then transferred to a scale where it is translated into 
            kilometers (Km) 
            b) Reducing and enlarging map and scale 
            When drawing a reduced map from a topographic map one may need to maintain the 
            number of boxes or half boxes covered by the original map itself,  but however the map 
            may be draw on a reduced scale than before 
            If the map was drawn on a topographic map say of 2cm x 2cm then the reduced scale 
            would be 1 cm x 1 cm on a graph paper 
            Reducing scale of map is done by multiplying half by the given scale  
            See below 
            1/
            2   x 1/
            25,000 
            Reduced scale would be 
            Enlarging scale of map is obtained by dividing scale of map by half 
            Example: 
            Page 10 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            1:50,000 
            ÷ 
            =  
            Therefore enlarged scale= 
            x 
            Map enlarged 
            (See below) 
            Map reduced 
            (See below) 
            c) Gradient of slope 
            Gradient is calculated using the horizontal equivalent and the vertical interval (VI) 
            The Horizontal Equivalent (HE) is the difference in distance between two points while 
            the vertical interval is the difference between the highest contour line on a given point 
            and the lowest contour line or the other end 
            The formula for gradient is 
            Gradient=  
            Both the vertical interval (VI) and Horizontal Equivalent are supposed to be in the same 
            units thus meters (See below) 
            Gradient=  =   
            15 meters represent 50 ft 
            Therefore, =  x15  
            VI = 75m 
            HE= 2.5Km 
            But 1000m=1Km 
            Therefore 2.5 Km=2.5 x 1000 
            =2500m 
            Gradient=   
            =1:33

            Continental drift theory 
            Success criteria 
             Explain the theory of continental drift 
             Explain evidence supporting the theory of Continental drift 
             Examine the weakness of the theory of continental drift 
            The theory states that the earth had one super continent (the pangea) and all the six continents 
            today came from it.  
            This was suggested by a scientist known as Wegener 
            The Gondwanaland and Laurasia were the first divisions of the continents and later came the six 
            continents that exists today 
            Evidence for continental drift theory 
            a. New rocks appear to be formed at the mid oceanic ridge as the older rocks are drawn at 
            the zone of subduction where plates collide 
            b. The type of fossils both plants and animals and also rock type and structure are identical 
            to those in south America and west-Africa 
            c. The shape of the continents that suggest that they can be fitted together especially 
            Americas, Europe and Africa 
            d. Glacial deposits found in Congo basin which is an equatorial zone 
            e. The magnetism of ancient rocks indicates that the continents came from a single 
            continent. Rocks are magnetized in the direction of magnetic north when solidifying 
            f. 
            There is an almost identical geological sequence of rock layers in south Africa, Deccan 
            plateau (India),plateau of south America and Antarctic

            g. Folded ranges of Argentina are similar in structure and age, to the folded cape ranges of 
            south Africa 
            h. Similarity in vegetation found in west Africa and that found in brazil of south  America 
            Weakness of the theory 
            1. It does not clearly explain the forces behind the drifting of the continents 
            2. The gig-saw shape of continents lack scientific  evidence to show that they once existed 
            together 
            3. The type of vegetation in west  Africa and that of Brazil is not enough to suggest that the 
            two places existed together 
            4. All the evidence given are based on assumptions hence lack scientific evidence of the 
            drift

             Explain the effects of geographical features on the environment and human activities 
            The theory suggest that the earth is made up of crusted plates that are always converging, 
            diverging or shearing due to convectional current within the mantle 
            Plate 
            It’s a solid rigid block of rocks that make up the earth’s crust 
            See below

            Cause of the plate tectonic 
            It is caused by convection current from the mantle that 
            allows plates resting on the asthenosphere to swing  or 
            move 
            Plates rest on a soft layer between the crust and the mantle 
            called asthenosphere 
            The asthenosphere carries the plates and moves them 
            horizontally with the help of convectional currents in the mantle 
            Examples of world plates and direction of movements 
            Name a plate 
            Direction of movement 
            Nazca plate 
            Pacific plate

            Plate boundaries 
            These are areas where active earth movements are observed or experienced 
            Some of these active earth movement are observed on the western side of the America, the 
            Himalaya mountains and around the mid-oceanic ridges 
            These places are common or active places for volcanic activity, earthquake

            Results of plate tectonic (Earth movement) 
            Plate tectonic results in formation of features such as; the 
            1. Nazcan trench on west of south America following the convergence of Nazcan and south 
            America plate 
            2. The Indies fold mountains on western south America

            7. Oceanic island are also common feature due to plate tectonic 
            Note: Plate tectonic also results in volcanic activity and earthquake 
            Beneficial effects of plate boundaries to people 
             There is an opportunity to generate electricity through Geo-therm. 
             Some fishing grounds have developed following trenches formed through 
            tectonic plates eg Nazcan leading to upwelling of water 
             They are sources of precious stones such as Diamond in Kimberley- 
            Australia 
             Some have formed beautiful scenic for tourism development 
             They have created an opportunity for agriculture activities eg Deccan 
            plateau in India 
             They have formed good habitat for wildlife 
             Fold mountains assist in the formation of orographic rainfall 
             Mountains help in modifying climatic conditions between regions

             Explain different features formed from mountain building process 
             Analyze the effects of mountain building on the life and human activities 
            Mountain building involves the folding and uplifting of rock masses a process known as 
            orogenesis

            A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area. 
            Examples of mountains includes: 
             Fold mountains 
             Block mountains 
             Volcanic mountains 
             Residual mountains 
            Fold mountains  
            Its due to compressional force acting on rock layer 
            The compressional force may result in the formation of a number of folds as follows:- 
            a. Simple fold 
            Both limbs that form a fold are the same 
            b. Over fold 
            One limb is pushed over the other 
            c. Recumbent fold 
            One limb is steeper than the other 
            d. Over-thrust fold (Nape) 
            A fracture occurs across rock layers 
            During this process of mountain building the Anticline becomes the mountain while the 
            syncline becomes the valley 
            Page 17

            Causes of fold mountain 
             The compressional forces exerted on the earth’s surface 
             Increasing load of overlaying rocks 
             Flow or movement within the mantle 
             Magnetic intrusion into the lithosphere 
             Expansion and contraction of some parts of the earth 
            Characteristics of fold Mountain  
            a. They are often long and high  
            b. They are associated with volcanic activities

            2. They contain stratified rocks 
            Page 18 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            3. They are characterized by linear ranges and valley 
            4. They are unstable because of occurrence of volcanoes and earthquakes which show that 
            they are still building up 
            Examples 
            a. Atlas of north Africa 
            b. Alps of Europe 
            c. Rockies of north America

            e. Himalayan of Asia 
            a. Old fold mountains 
            They have round tops 
            Some parts of are reduced to peneplains i.e low lying, fairly level surface e.g plateau 
            Examples are 
            Mountains in central Europe 
            Mountains in north west Europe (Scotland) 
            Influence of Fold Mountains on human activities

            c. They provide minerals 
            d. They act as communication barriers e.g Alps mountain 
            e. Some fold mountain ranges provide valuable forest resources 
            Block Mountains 
            When the earth crust bends folding occurs, but when it cracks faulting takes place 
            A fault is a crack or fracture in the earth’s surface 
            Causes of faulting  
            (i) 
            (ii) 
            Tensional forces 
            Compressional forces 
            Tensional force: 
            It tend to pull the crust apart leading to the formation 
            of faults 
            This may increase the size of the earth’s crust. 
            Page 19 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            It may cause the central block to sink and becomes a Rift valley or rise and becomes a block 
            mountain 
            (see below) 
            Compressional force: 
            This force too may result in the 
            formation of faults in the earth’s 
            crust. 
            If force continues, it forces the 
            outer block to rise above the 
            central block and become a rift 
            valley while the standing blocks 
            may later become Block 
            Mountains  
            (See below)  
            Types of faults: 
            Normal faults caused by tensional force 
            (see below) 
            Reverse faults caused by compressional force

            pile-up into a mountain. 
             Fault side are source of hot or cold water 
             Faults permits ore forming chemical solution to rise along the fault plane 
             Fault may hinder contraction of roads and railways 
            These are formed through viscous or thick lava ejected from a fissure in the earth’s crust which 
            Volcanic mountains result into a steep sided cone 
            Examples of volcanic Mountains include: 
             Mt. Fujiyama (Japan), Mt. Merapi (Sumatra), Mt. Cartopax (Ecuador), Mt. Mayon (

            Residual Mountains 
            These are mountains formed through denudation process in which the land got lowered through 
            agents of erosion 
            Residual means remains from an original mountain  
            Hence residual mountains are formed from the remains of al already existing mountain such as 
            Volcanic, Block or Fold Mountain 
            Examples of residual mountains:- 
             Mt. Monadnock (Asia)

            Caldera 
            Volcanic activity 
            This is usually formed when a volcano erupts violently in an already existing cone whereby 
            blowing away the crater to its vent and creating a hallow area 
            However, when a caldera is filled with water it 
            becomes a lake referred to as a Caldera lake. 
            Lake Toba 
            These can be divided into three stages

             They mostly occur on the Western side of the continents 
            Measurement of an earthquake 
            It is measured using an instrument called a Seismograph 
            The magnitude of an earthquake is recorded on an instrument called a Richter Scale 
            A Richter Scale of 9.5 is the maximum strength of an earthquake and result in maximum 
            destruction 
            A Richter Scale of 1.o is the minimum strength of an earthquake and cause minimum destruction 
            The FOCUS is the point in the earth’s crust where the earthquake waves originate 
            The epicenter is an area above the focus where the effect of an earthquake wave is felt

            Some mineral are elements while some exists on compounds 
            Examples of elements 
            Carbon, Gold, Sulphur, Copper,  Diamond 
            Examples of compounds 
            1. Silica (SiO) 
            2. Felspur and silicates of aluminium, potassium, sodium and calcium 
            3. Aligite, hornblende and olivine are silicates of iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) 
            and aluminium (Al) 
            4. Clay minerals are a complex of silicate felspurs 
            Classification of rock 
            This is based on 
            a. Texture of rocks 
            b. Origin of rock 
            Main types of rocks 
            There are three main classes of rocks namely 
            1. Igneous rocks 
            2. Sedimentary rocks 
            3. Metamorphic rocks 
            Igneous rocks 
            Formation 
            They are formed through solidification of molten material coming from the interior of the earth 
            When the molten material comes out it is called lava 
            When the molten material does not come outside of the earth it is called magma 
            Types of igneous rocks 
            There are two main types 
            a. Intrusive/platonic igneous rock 
            These are igneous rocks formed through the solidification of magma within the earth’s 
            crust

            They are also known as Abyssal rocks 
            Such kind f rocks cools very slowly that result in the following characteristics 
            1. They have large sized crystals 
            2. They are course 
            Examples of plutonic igneous rocks include 
            i) 
            ii) 
            iii) 
            Granite 
            Gabro 
            Diorite 
            b. Extrusive/volcanic igneous rock 
            These are the igneous rocks formed through the solidification of lava-outside the earth’s 
            crust 
            They are also known as Hypabyssal 
            The cooling of such rocks is very rapid resulting into the following characteristics 
            i) 
            The rocks have very fine crystals(no crystals) 
            ii) 
            They are very smooth 
            Examples of such rocks include 
            Basalts, scoria, andesite, rhyolite, pumice, obsidian 
            Characteristics of igneous rocks include 
            i) 
            ii) 
            iii) 
            Sedimentary rocks 
            Formation 
            They are crystalline 
            They do not occur in strata (not stratified) 
            They do not contain fossils since they are formed from magma coming 
            from the mantle 
            They are found by compaction or cementation of deposited sediments 
            Sedimentary rocks are derived from weathering and erosion of rocks 
            The deposited materials are compressed together by pressure and heat through the process 
            known as lithification 
            Characteristics 
            1. They occur in layers 
            2. Some sedimentary rocks contain fossils

            Note: 
             Mud can change to clay through compaction  
             Mud can change to mudstone through compaction/ cementation 
             Mud can change to shale through compaction 
             Silt can change to siltstone through cementation 
             Sand can change to sandstone through cementation

             Sandstone 
             Siltstone 
             Shale 
             Mudstone 
            Other examples of sedimentary rocks 
            a. Mechanically formed (physically) 
            These are sedimentary rocks formed by weathered material which are deposited or 
            compacted or cemented together 
            Examples:  
            i) 
            Sandstone 
            ii) 
            iii) 
            Conglomerate 
            Shale 
            b. Chemically formed 
            These are formed by cementation and compaction of minerals with rock particles 
            Examples: 
            i) 
            ii) 
            Limestone 
            Chalk 
            c. Biologically formed (organically formed) 
            These are formed from plants and animal remains 
            Examples: 
            i) 
            ii) 
            Coal 
            Oil shale 
            Metamorphic rock 
            Formation 
            These are rocks which are formed from already existing rocks after being exposed to great 
            pressure and heat 
            The already existing rocks change their form into a new form (chemically) 
            Page 30 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            The rocks may change their chemical composition after being exposed to intense 
            a. Heat 
            b. Pressure 
            c. Hydro-thermal, liquids and gasses 
            Examples: 
            1. Limestone (sedimentary)
            2. Clay  (sedimentary)         
            3. shale (sedimentary)

                            graphite (metamorphic) 
            Note:  metamorphic rocks are common in volcanic region 
            After rocks have changed their form they become resistant and compact 
            Metamorphic means changed form 
            Importance of rocks 
            1. Rocks can be used for construction of buildings and roads 
            2. Some rocks provide energy e.g coal 
            3. Rocks if weathered they provide fertile soil for agriculture 
            4. Some rocks when processed may provide fertilizer 
            5. They can also be used for roofing e.g slate 
            6. Some rocks help in storage of water e.g aquifer rocks 
            7. Rocks contain important minerals such as gold

            Rock cycle 
            The rock cycle is also known as lithological cycle or geological cycle 
            What is involved in the cycle? 
            All rocks are subject to change to other types of rocks e.g starting from igneous rocks this can be 
            weathered to form sediments 
            Sediments are lithified or stratified and compacted to form sedimentary rocks 
            The sediments can also be metamorphosed to form metamorphic rock 
            The metamorphic rock may melt to magma as a result of great pressure and heat 
            The magma crystallize through a process of crystallization to form igneous 
            Note 
            Rocks can be transformed to any class of rock 
            Sometimes short cuts can occur within the rock cycle e.g sedimentary rocks may not be buried 
            deeply enough to be metamorphosed and may be exposed to denudation and erosion soon after 
            they are formed 
            Another example is that igneous rocks underground (platonic) may not be exposed into the 
            surface to be converted into sedimentary but may change directly to metamorphic rocks and may 
            change directly to metamorphic rocks and may be transformed to magma.

             Identify riverine features on a topographic map 
             Identify coastal features on a topographical map 
            Riverine landforms : 
            These are features that are formed due to the movement of a river eg Delta, gorge, ox-box lakes, 
            meanders, floodplains, waterfall, cataracts and rapids, tributary and distributary , leeves  etc 
            Formation of riverine landforms 
            Delta: 
            Formed when a river load is deposited faster than it can be washed away by a water wave from a 
            water body eg Nile delta 
            Gorge: 
            Formed due to an undercutting of a stream or river across a land mass eg Mpatamanja gorge 
            Ox-bow Lake: 
            Formed from a cut-off loop of a river meander as the river struggles to flow on a very low 
            gradient  
            River meander: 
            Page 33 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            It’s the bending of a river as it passes across a low gradient in its maturity stage 
            Flood plain: 
            Its’ an area of land that often experiences an over flow of water especially during heavy rainfall 
            eg the Lower Shire 
            Waterfalls 
            These are sudden vertical falls of water 
            cascading over the edge of a hard rock 
            layer, plateau or high level side valley 
            Rapids and cataracts 
            Distributary: 
            These are sudden roughing up of a river flow as water flow across rock outcrops 
            Rapids are common on the upper part of a river (upper course) where the land is steep 
            These are smaller channels of river emerging from a bigger 
            river after the mother river-flow is blocked due by 
            sediments or spit from the sea 
            Tributary: It’s a small river that flows into a larger river 
            Tributaries are commonly observed in the middle or upper course 
            of a river

            It has levees 
            It has levees 
            It’s a raised land of mud added to it by a river-every-time it over flows 
            It is a bank of alluvial deposits bouldering a 
            river in its lower course and it is built up by 
            deposition laying above the level of the 
            flood plain 
            See below

            RELIEF FEATURES OF THE OCEAN BASIN 
            Success criteria:- 
             Explain relief features of the ocean basin 
             Explain the terms ocean current, drift and streams 
             Identify world ocean currents of the world

             Continental shelf   
            Its’ an area of land that connects 
            continents and ocean basin 
            It is usually a shallow part of the 
            oceans due to deposition of 
            sediments by rivers from land 
            masses  
             Continental slope 
             Ocean floor 
             Deep points eg Philippian 
            deep  
             Oceanic ridge eg the Mid-Atlantic ridge 
             Trenches eg Peruvian trench 
             Oceanic islands 
            Ocean currents 
            Drifts  
            Its faster flow/moving of water in an ocean/sea due to different temperature variations 
            Page 36 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            These are slower-moving or flow of oceanic water as a result of friction from the prevailing winds 
            e.g West wind drifts and the North Atlantic drift 
            Types of ocean currents 
            They are two 
            a. Warm ocean currents 
            b. Cold ocean currents 
            Warm ocean currents 
            It’s a large body of warm water laden with moist air flowing from low latitudes to high latitudes  
            Examples include: 
             North Pacific,  Gulf Stream, North Atlantic drift, Kurosiwo, Brazilian, Mozambique, East Australia 
            Cold ocean currents 
            It’s a large body of cold water that moves from high latitude (polar) to tropical 
            Cold ocean currents are located on the Western side of the continents 
            These currents have less effects on temperature because they lie under off-shore winds 
            Examples include 
             California,  Labradors, East Greenland (Irminger), Canaries,  Kamchatka, Peruvian (Humboldt), 
            Banguela, West Australian, West wind drift 
            Causes of ocean 
            currents 
            a. Temperature 
            variation 
            The difference in 
            temperature between 
            the polar region and 
            tropical region. Warm 
            water from tropical 
            region easily flow 
            polar-wards 
            b. Difference in 
            salinity and density 
            Page 37 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            The tropical region has highly saline water that easily sink down due to its high density 
            However, water also flows side wards from tropical to polar where there is less saline through the 
            process of diffusion 
            c. Prevailing winds 
            Blowing/moving air above water normally force a water body to move from one point to the other 
            Water bodies/ocean normally follow the direction of the prevailing winds 
            d. Rotation of the earth 
            Rotation of the earth causes the deflection of ocean currents 
            Water bodies in the northern hemisphere are deflected to the right while those in the south are 
            deflected to the left 
            Direction of ocean currents 
            Causes of direction taken by ocean currents 
            a. Land masses shape 
            A land mass may cause a change in the direction of an ocean current 
            An ocean current that has come across a land mass is forced to change its course of direction 
            b. Prevailing winds 
            The prevailing winds blowing across water bodies causes water body to take the direction of its flow 
            Ocean currents caused by prevailing winds are known as drift e.g the North Atlantic drift 
            c. Rotation of the earth 
            The rotation of the earth often creates coliolis force that forces ocean to be deflected to the right in 
            the North and left in the Southern Hemisphere 
            This deflection is described by a law known as Ferrow’s Law of deflection 
            Effects of ocean currents 
            a. Temperature 
            Cold ocean currents often lowers the temperature f the coastal land along its path. Such ocean 
            currents include Banguela, Peruvian, California and Oyasiwo 
            On-shore winds blowing across the cold ocean current are often cooled to form fog 
            The cold ocean current often result in dryness of coastal land and form desert such as the Atacama 
            and Namib deserts 
            The warm ocean currents often raise the temperature of the New Foundland and Western part of 
            Britain 
            The Mozambique warm ocean current often raise temperature of the Eastern coast of Africa  
            b. Climate 
            Ocean current modify climatic conditions of some areas such as the Kurosiwo current that often carry 
            much heat from the tropic to the North 
            The North Atlantic drift that often cause mild winters in Western Europe 
            The circulation of cold and warm ocean current often contribute to global warming through the 
            reliance of the C.F.C gas from deep oceans 
            Page 38 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            c. Fishing 
            The meeting of the warm and cold ocean currents often cause rapid growth of plankton that are food 
            for fertile e.g the meeting of the Kamchatka and Kurosiwo has led to the development of the Western 
            Pacific fishing ground 
            The Cold Labrador meets with the Warm North Atlantic drift that led to the development of North 
            Western Atlantic Fishing ground 
            d. Shipping industry 
            Ocean current often assists in the movement of ship across oceans 
            Ships that sail along with an ocean current often move swiftly 
            However those ship moving against an ocean current may end-up crushing 
            Furthermore, ship moving in the direction of an ocean current saves fuel 
            WORLD PRESSURE BELTS 
            Success criteria: 
             Explain the term air pressure 
             Explain factors that influence air pressure 
             Locate the main air pressure belts on world maps 
             Account for the distribution of pressure belts in the world 
            Air pressure:- 
            It’s the weight  exerted by air from the atmosphere  
            Air pressure is measured using instruments known as Barometer and expressed in units called mill bars 
            Factors affecting air pressure 
            a. Temperature 
            The higher the temperature, the lower the atmospheric air pressure since molecules of air expand and 
            lose weight with increasing temperature 
            b. Altitude 
            The higher the altitude the lower the 
            atmospheric air pressure 
            When the altitude is decreasing air pressure 
            increases 
            c. Distribution of land and sea 
            Differences in the heating rates of both the land and sea result in earth low or high air pressure 
            d. Amount of water vapour 
            Page 39 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            Air with high amount of water vapour has low air pressure since water vapour rising is associated 
            with an increasing temperature that negatively affect air pressure  
            e. The speed of wind 
            If the speed of wind is high air pressure is likely to be lowered since wind speed tend to clear air 
            molecules away from a specific place 
            f. 
            Rotation of the earth 
            This cause air around the equator to be thrown away and pile-up along the 30° North/South of the 
            equator where it leads to a high pressure belt, while the equator experiences low air pressure 
            g. The size of space air is force to occupy 
            If air is forced to occupy a small space its air pressure rises up while if it occupies a larger space its 
            air pressure rises up while if it occupies a larger space its air pressure goes down. For instance, there 
            is low air pressure at low latitude (0° equator) than the high latitude (90° polar) due to space air 
            occupies 
            Distribution of air pressure on the globe: 
            Reasons for the distribution of pressure belts: 
            (a) Equatorial low pressure belts 
            The high temperature due to over head sun account for low pressure belt 
            (b) Horse latitude 
            The reduction on the size of the earth or narrowing of the earth account for the rising pressure 
            Page 40 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            The pilling of atmospheric air from the equator account for the rising air pressure 
            (c) Temperate low pressure belt: 
            The increasing in the size of the earth with air moving from the polar region account for the 
            reduction in the pressure 
            (d) The polar region: 
            The low temperature  in the region account for the high pressure 
            The pilling of air from the equatorial region also causes the rising air pressure 
            Effects of low air pressure 
             Preparing food in low pressure areas like mountain takes a long time than places with high air 
            pressure 
             Low pressure may cause breathing problems in mountainous areas due to reduced oxygen with thin 
            air 
            PREVAILING WIND 
            Wind: 
             Its air in motion (It is the moving air) 
             The movement of air is caused by differences in heating system of the earth surface by the sun 
            Types of wind 
            There are three types 
            1. Prevailing wind 
            2. Monsoon winds 
            3. Local winds 
            A. Prevailing winds -These are winds that blow for a long period of time over a specific place or area -They normally develops in regions of high pressure belts and moves faster into the regions of low 
            pressure belts 
            They include:- 
            a. Westeries winds 
            b. Polar winds 
            c. Trade winds 
            Characteristics of prevailing winds 
            a. Westeries 
             They blow from the subtropical (horse latitude) to the temperate low pressure belt 
            Page 41 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
             They are deflected to the right and named south westerly in northern hemisphere and to 
            the left in south hemisphere to be north westerly 
             They have a number of depression (cyclones) 
             The depression in westerly brings in cyclonic rainfall to affected areas 
             They change in direction and strength of wind 
            b. Trades 
             They blow from horse latitude (subtropical to doldrums equatorial belt) 
             They are constant in strength and direction 
             They follow a regular path 
             They bring in a cooling effect to areas over which they pass 
             -They bring prolonged rain to coastal areas after passing over an ocean 
             -They are deflected to the right in the North to become North East trade and left in south 
            hemisphere to become South East trades 
            c. Polar winds 
             -They blow from the polar high pressure belt to low temperate pressure belt 
             In the north it is deflected to the right to become North East polar and in south to the left 
            to be south east polar wind 
            Influence of prevailing winds by pressure belts 
             The trade winds mainly develop from the subtropical high pressure belts (Horse latitudes) 
             The polar winds mainly develops from the high pressure belt of the polar region 
             The westeries mainly develops from the horse latitude and moves in a north easterly direction from 
            the south west ( northern hemisphere) 
            Importance of prevailing wind 
            a. Trade winds belts are good for ship or marine vessels sailing westward 
            b. Westerly wind belts are good for long distance flying 
            c. Transcontinental flying in the easterly direction requires less fuel and shorter time 
            Ferrel’s Law of deflection (coriolis force) 
             Ferrel’s law of deflection states that any freely moving body in the northern hemisphere is deflected 
            to the right-hand side of its’ flow in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the Southern 
            hemisphere 
             In this case, Westeries (prevailing wind) destined for the north is deflected to its’ right and therefore 
            take a North East direction in the northern hemisphere 
             The polar wind destined for the south would take the South West direction in the northern 
            hemisphere 
             A trade wind destined for the north would take a north west direction   
            Page 42 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
             The Coriolis force: is the act of deflection of a freely moving body to the left or right hand side of its 
            ‘movement depending on the hemisphere it has developed 
            Isobars on an air pressure map 
             Isobars are lines drawn on a map joining all places 
            of the same air pressure 
             Isobars helps gives direction of the movement of 
            wind on a particular place

             Explain the main types of air masses 
             Explain the weather associated with air mass 
            AN AIR MASS: 
            It’s a large volume of air whose temperature and humidity are fairly uniform 
            An air mass develops over an area which is extensive and also uniform in-built shape e.g over deserts, 
            oceans e.t.c 
            Types of air masses: 
             Cold 
             Dry 
             Moist 
             warm 
            Description of an Air Mass 
            (i) 
            Temperature 
            An air mass can be referred as  
             Cold or warm 
            Cold air masses are heavy while warm air masses are light 
            Page 43 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            (ii) 
            Humidity 
            An air mass may be described as :- 
             moist or dry 
            Air masses that crosses an ocean are normally moist while hose that passes over land are dry 
            Note: 
             A cold air mass is formed or develops when an air mass comes into contact with a cold surface for a 
            long period of time such as in polar regions 
             A warm air mass develops when an air mass comes in contact with a warm surface for a long period 
            such as in tropical and temperate regions 
            Source of an air mass 
            This is the origin of air masses which could be over land or over oceans 
            Air masses that has land as its source are called continental air mass while those that has oceans as their 
            source are called maritime air masses 
            Classification of air masses 
            They are classified according to  
            a. Latitude 
            Air masses are classified according to the region they develop:- 
             Tropical region air mass 
             Temperate region air mass 
             Polar region air mass 
             Equatorial regional air mass 
            b. Nature 
            Air masses may develop over land or over oceans 
            Air masses developing over land are called continental air mass while those developing over land 
            are called continental air mass while those developing over ocean are called maritime air mass  
            c. Latitude and nature 
            Air masses that develops over land in polar region are called polar continental air mass while those 
            developing over oceans in polar are called polar maritime air mass 
            Air mass that develops over land in temperate regions are called temperate continental air mass 
            while if it develops over oceans it is known as temperate maritime air mass 
            Air mass developing in tropical region over land are known as tropical continental air mass while 
            that developing over oceans is called tropical maritime air mass 
            Page 44 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            Air mass developing in equatorial region over land are called equatorial continental air mass while 
            if an air mass develop over ocean it is called equatorial maritime air mass 
            Note: an air mass becomes stable if its temperature and that of the surrounding environment is the same, 
            such air mass does not rise high 
            An air mass whose temperature is slightly higher than its surrounding environment is referred to as being 
            unstable as it continue rising as it is being cooled in the atmosphere, such air mass result in development of 
            heavy storm and rainfall 
            Weather associated with Air Masses 
             Air masses developing over the continents in tropical region may bring in dry hot air 
             It may result in cool air if the air mass develops over a cold such as polar region 
             It may result in high rainfall if the air mass develops in a high humid area 
            FRONTS 
            Success criteria: 
             Explain the term front 
             Explain the formation of fronts 
             Identify characteristics of different types of fronts 
             Describe the type of weather associated with each type of front 
             Explain the ITCZ and its impact on weather 
            A Front 
            It’s a line of boundary that separate a cold air mass and a warm air mass in low temperate air pressure belt 
            It separates the polar cold air mass from the warm westeries air mass 
            Types of fronts 
            They are two main types 
            a. Warm front 
            b. Cold front 
            A. Cold front 
            It occurs when a cold mass of air overtakes a warm air 
            mass

            The cold parcel of air displaces a warm air and force it to rise up 
            The formation of clouds and precipitation at the frontal zone is caused by frontal uplifting 
            Characteristics of cold front 
             Brings in cold air and lower temperature 
             Atmospheric pressure decreases steadily with rising warm air mass 
             Causes wind to change direction 
             It leads to the formation of cumulus and cumulonimbus and cirrus clouds 
            B. Warm front 
            A warm parcel of air displaces a cold parcel of air 
            A warm front is the transition zone in the atmosphere where an advancing warm subtropical moist air 
            mass replace a retreating cold dry polar air mass 
            Characteristics of a warm front 
             Brings in warm air  
             Atmospheric pressure steadily decreases 
             Changes the direction of wind 
             Shower, snow and drizzle follow 
             Cirrus, cirrostratus, altostratus and nimbostratus brings in precipitation 
            Occlusions 
             It occurs in mid-latitude depression when the 
            cold front catches up with the warm front 
             If the air behind the warm sector is colder than 
            the air in front of it, a cold occlusion occurs 
            See below 
            How a depression develops 
             Cold polar air generally moves in a westerly direction while the warm westerly winds moves in an 
            easterly direction 
             However, friction between the two air masses cause a 
            wave to develop 
            See below 
            Page 46 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
             The wave bulges into the cold air and becomes bigger and 
            pressure falls at the tip f the bulge(wave) 
             An anticlockwise circulation of wind blows around the low 
            pressure point 
             As the bulge develops, the warm air rises up over the cold air at the front of the bulge 
             The front where warm air rises is called the warm 
            front 
             If the rear of the bulge, the cold air forces its way 
            under the warm air 
             The rear fronts is called the cold front 
             The warm air between the two fronts is called the 
            warm sector 
             The warm front is normally more gently sloping than the cold  
            Weather associated with a depression (cyclone) 
            Explanation 
             The passage of temperature depression across a Centre ‘A’ 
             The sky will be clear except for a little high cirrus cloud 
             The wind will blow from the South East 
             After a while, a definite cloud over develops and light showers of rain occurs which gets heavier 
             The warm front passes ‘A’ 
             The rain stops and the wind changes from south east to south west at ‘A’ 
             Temperature rise and the air is humid because the warm sector lies over ‘A’ 
             As the cold front passes, the weather changes vary rapidly 
             The wind now blows from the North West and the temperature falls 
             With the passage of the depression at ‘A’ the sky clears and remains cool 
            The inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) 
            The climate of Africa is greatly influenced by the movement of air masses (maritime and continental) which 
            differ in moisture content and stability 
            Page 47 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            Unstable air mass will easily rise as compared to stable air mass 
            The zone where continental and maritime air mass meet is called the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) 
            The ITCZ is not stable but keeps moving between the southern Africa and northern part of Africa and 
            northern part of Africa depending on the position of the sun 
            In summer the ITCZ stretches in the southern Africa in January as seen below 
            In January 
            The ITCZ is normally the meeting of zone of air masses of different characteristics, air masses that are moist 
            and light are forced to rise above others that are cool and dry and result into frontal rainfall 
            However, the ITCZ is not the only factor that causes rainfall in Africa but same factors include  
             
             
            Highlands facing warm moist air mass 
            Convection currents in hot tropical air 
             The ITCZ is not a front because air masses meeting in the zone have little difference in temperature 
            and pressure 
             The ITCZ is normally associated with rains coming from the cumulonimbus clouds accompanied by 
            lightening, thunder and heavy rains 
             Some gusty winds which bring rain showers 
             The cumulus clouds brought in by the ITCZ slightly reduces the temperature 
            LOCAL WINDS 
            Success criteria: 
             Explain the term local winds 
             Explain the characteristics of local winds

             Explain the occurance of land and sea breeses 
             Explain the influence of land and sea breeze on local and human activities 
            Local winds 
             They affect a smaller local area 
             They are influenced by the immediate surrounding environment such as relief or temperature  
            i) 
            Land and sea breeze winds 
            Sea breeze 
            It’s the movement of cool air from the sea 
            to the land 
            Sea breeze normally takes place during 
            the day 
            High temperature of the sun creates low 
            air pressure over the land and wind blows 
            from the sea to the land 
            This normally happen due to difference in the cooling and heating system of land and water body 
            Land gets heated up faster than a water body therefore emit heat as it loses its air pressure 
            See below 
            Land breeze 
            It’s the movement of cool air from the land surface to the sea 
            Land breeze normally takes place during the night 
            The low temperature of the night makes the land to lose its warmth abruptly and create a high 
            pressure over land while the sea (water body) emits its heat slowly and thus creates an area of 
            low air pressure 
            See below 
            Page 49 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            Note: in tropic sea, at night land breeze can be strong making fish sail out with them from the 
            coast, however, during the morning fish may return with the sea breeze 
            Sailing ships leave at night when land breezes drive them seaward 
            ii) 
            Regional winds 
            These include winds such as the Fohn of Alpine, the Chinook of Rocky Mountain, the Chiperoni 
            of Africa, Hamattan of North Africa 
            Local winds can be divided into three main types 
            a. Depression winds 
            These are local winds created or caused by low air pressure  
            Such winds can further be divided into two parts 
            i) 
            ii) 
            i) 
            ii) 
            Warm winds 
            Cold winds 
            Warm depression winds 
            These are hot and dusty 
            If such winds cross a water body, they become very humid and may cause rainfall 
            Examples include:- 
             Sirocco in North Africa 
             Leveche in Spain 
             Khamsin in Egypt 
             Hamattan in West Africa 
             Santa Ana in California 
             Zonder in South America 
             Brick fielder in Australia 
             Chili in Tunisia 
            Cold depression winds 
            These are often very strong gusty and bitterly cold depression winds especially if they pass 
            through a narrow valley eg. Mistral of France 
            Example of cold winds  
             Mistral of France (Central Europe)

             Bora of Yugoslavia 
             Pampero of South America (Argentina) 
             Southerly Buster of Australia  
             Buran 
            b. Descending winds (mountain winds) 
            They descend mountains into low laying lands (valleys) 
            When descending winds are going down a slope on the leeward side, their temperature drops at the 
            rate of 6.5°c every 1000m 
            Examples of descending winds:- 
            i) 
            Chinook of the Rockies Mountain in North America 
            The Chinook raise the temperature of the prairies and make wheat cultivation in winter possible 
            ii) The Fohn of Switzerland across the Alps mountain 
            It melts snow in winter and cause avalanches and also help in ripening of fruits like grapes 
            iii) The Berg of south Africa veldt descending the Drakensberg plateau of south Africa 
            It helps raise the temperature of the south coast of South Africa during winter (May-August) 
            Others include:- 
             Samun of Iran in Asia  
             Nevada’s if 
            USA 
             Ecuador of 
            South America 
            c. Convection winds 
            These are winds that are 
            caused by intense heating 
            of air and the heated air 
            produce convection winds 
            which give rise to dust and 
            sand storm 
            They normally occur in 
            some deserts 
            Examples include 
            i) 
            Dust devil of 
            Sahara (North Africa) 
            ii) 
            Note:  
            Simoon of Sahara desert too. 
            1.  The Hamattan of North Africa from Sahara desert are common in west Africa 
            They are hot, dry and dusty and causes great damage to crops 
            It splits trunks of trees

            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            In Guinea Coast such local winds encourages evaporation and cooling effect that leads to heavy 
            rainfall 
            2. The Chiperoni wind of southern Africa originates from Indian ocean 
            It is caused by the movement of Inter tropical Convergence Zone (I.C.T.Z) to the northern 
            hemisphere and is common from May to August 
            The Chiperon winds are loaded with moisture as it originates from an oceanic body 
            It brings persistent stratus clouds and drizzles in the Shire highlands 
            3. The Chinook (Snow eater) melts and dries up winter snow 
            It also moves pollutants such fumes away from their sources and raise the temperature by 19°c 
            definitely reducing snow falling in the region

            Depression/cyclones 
             Its an air mass which has low air pressure at the Centre and high outside 
             A depression is normally associated with oval shaped isobars 
             A depression is associated with instability or unsettled weather and rainfall 
             Depression normally develops along the temperature low pressure belt of 60° North/South 
             They consists of whirling masses of air (clockwise) in the southern hemisphere 
             They usually bring prolonged rainfall to the 
            coastal area and often very windy weather   
             A cyclone is a system of wind rotating around a 
            Centre of low-air pressure clockwise in the 
            southern hemisphere and anticlockwise in the 
            nation hemisphere 
             It has low air pressure at the Centre with cyclonic (inward) air flow and normally air ascends at the 
            Centre of a cyclone 
            i) 
            Temperate cyclones 
            They arise from westerly winds caused by the mixing of cold air from the tropical regions 
            They swell /whirl anti-clockwise in the southern hemisphere 
            They are associated with prolonged windy rains to coastal regions 
            See below 
            Explanation 
            In the 1st stage, the polar winds (cold air) 
            meets with warm air westerly in the temperate 
            low pressure belt 
            In the 2nd stage the polar wind is forced to take 
            a westerly direction while the westerly takes an 
            easterly direction 
            In 3rd stage, friction occurs that creates low air 
            pressure and the two winds swing and face each 
            other 
            In 4th stage, the warm westerly pushes against 
            the polar front and start rising against the cold 
            front where it creates a warm sector 
            The 5th stage, the warm westerly rises up into 
            the atmosphere where it gets cooled, condensed 
            and form clouds 
            Page 58 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            The 6th stage, the cold front catches up with the warm front and the process of occlusion is reached 
            The 7th stage, the cold front pushes the warm front into the atmosphere and take up its position on the 
            ground at this stage, a cyclone dies as the two fronts gets separated and the fronts are referred to as  occluded 
            fronts. 
            Direction of wind in cyclone and anticyclone 
            See below 
            a. Northern hemisphere 
            b. Southern hemisphere 
            Tropical cyclones 
            They occur mainly in the tropical region 
            arising from trade winds belts 
            They are characterized by strong destructive winds 
            They are smaller in size as compared to temperate depression (Cyclones) 
            They are called hurricanes in the West Indies or Willy Willies in Queensland of Australia or Typhoons in 
            India and China or Tornados in south USA and Guinea 
            Characteristics of tropical cyclones 
             There is sudden drop in air pressure 
             The temperature and humidity of the 
            surrounding area rises up 
             The skill looks dull with heavy clouds 
             When the vortex arise the wind 
            becomes violent 
             They move clockwise in southern 
            hemisphere 
             It is normally accompanied by heavy 
            rain and showers 
             Large amount of latent heat is produced during the condensation of moist tropical air

            Rotation in cyclones 
            Energy for the storm is supplied from latent heat of condensation of rising air as it cools 
            The difference in air pressure between the inner part of a cyclone and the out put make warm-light air to rise 
            while cool heavy air sinks 
            As heavier air flows inwards the rotation of the earth makes it swirl or rotate 
            Stages in development of a tropical cyclone 
            a. Formative stage 
            Meeting of two air masses and uplifting of lighter air mass 
            Condensation occurs resulting in heavy rainfall and during this process of condensation latent heat is 
            produced that makes the cyclone to rotate 
            b. Mature stage 
            Air pressure drops and the cyclone increases 
            c. Degenerative stage 
            The cyclone reaches the land and air pressure in the centre rises and the cyclone gradually dies out 
            Necessary conditions for tropical cyclones development 
            Warm moist air with a temperature above 27°c 
            Inward blowing of air toward the centre 
            An inward flow of air in the upper 
            layer of the atmosphere 
            effects of tropical cyclone 
            The high winds destroy building 
            bridges and trees in coastal area 
            They may cause sparkles of fire or 
            electric poles collide 
            They reduce moisture content over 
            the land surface and destroy crops 
            ANTI CYCLONES 
            It is an air mass that has high pressure at the Centre and low-outside

            Characteristics of anti-cyclones 
             They are slow moving or stationary  
             Produce a warming and a decrease in relative humidity  
             They bring hot, sunny conditions in summer with little cloud and coastal fogs  
             The skies are clear at night and temperatures are low in winter 
            Examples of anti-cyclones 
             South pacific high pressure

            Clouds remain in the atmosphere until they are heavy enough to fall down in form of precipitation 
            Clouds are formed through condensation of water vapor 
            They are classified according to appearance and height above sea level

             Identify areas in the world receiving different types of rainfall 
             Interpret rainfall data from different sources 
            It is measured using an instrument called a Rain gauge 
            See below 
            Position of rain gauge 
            It stands 30cm from the ground level to avoid splashes of 
            water 
            It is supposed to be sunk into the ground to reduce 
            evaporation 
            The funnel helps direct water into the jar 
            Note 
             The measuring cylinder is used t measure the amount of water that fell in an area 
             The tapped shape of a cylinder help improve accuracy 
            World distribution of rainfall 
            Types of rainfall 
            They are three 
            a. Convection rainfall 
            b. Cyclonic/ depression rainfall 
            c. Orthographic/ relief rainfall 
            A. Convection rainfall 
            Page 63 
            GGK MHANGO 0999357824 email: gmhango53@gmail.com 
            It is caused by intense heat that leads to the rising of warm moist light air 
            It is common in tropical regions 
            The rainfall is associated with lightning and thunderstorm 
            The thunder storm is caused by rapid expansion and contraction of air 
            B. Cyclonic/depression rainfall 
            It is a type of rainfall that occurs when air masses of 
            different characteristics meet 
            Warm light air mass is forced to rise above the cold dry 
            air which is heavy 
            The rainfall normally lasts for long period of time even 
            days 
            Cyclonic rainfall is common throughout the doldrums 
            where the trade winds meet 
            They are common in the temperate region 
            See below 
            C. Relief/orographic rainfall 
            It is caused by the rising of warm moist air mass above 
            highlands/ hills that are at right angle to an incoming 
            air mass 
            Warm moist air is forced to rise high altitude where it 
            gets cooled and condenses to form clouds 
            Common in high relief regions facing the direction of 
            warm moist air from the sea

            It is an aggregate of day to day weather over a prolonged period of time 
            Factors influencing climate 
             Latitude,  Altitude, Ocean current, Prevailing winds, Air masses, Distance from the sea 
            (Continentally)

            Latitude 
            It refers to the location of a place from the equator 
            Temperature decreases with increasing distance away from the equator 
            Altitude 
            Temperature decreases with increasing height above sea level. Higher places normally experience 
            higher rainfall than low lands 
            Ocean currents 
            Warm or cold ocean currents have an influence over the coastal land adjustment to their flow. 
            Warm ocean currents will often raise temperature and on-shore winds normally brings rainfall 
            Cold ocean currents will often reduce temperature and an on-shore wind is normally cool and dry 
            and discourages rainfall 
            Prevailing  winds 
            In temperate latitude prevailing winds from the land lower the winter temperature but raise the 
            summer temperature. Prevailing winds from the sea raise the winter temperature but lower the 
            summer temperature 
            In tropical latitude on-shore winds modify the temperature of coastal region because they have 
            blown over cooler ocean surface 
            Air masses 
            Air masses blowing from low latitude to higher latitudes warm the ocean over which they blow 
            Cool or dry air masses cause little or no rainfall while moist air masses bring warm and wet 
            conditions 
            Distance from the sea (Continentally) 
            This occurs due to the difference in the heating and cooling effect of the land and water body 
            This is very common in temperate region when oceanic bodies are warmer and influence the 
            temperature of the coastal regions (refer to land sea breeze) 
            Climate whose temperature are influenced by sea are called maritime/ oceanic/ insular climate 
            Climates whose temperature are influenced by remoteness (away from sea) are called continental 
            climate and they occur central-continents

            DYNAMICS ACROSS THE WORLD IN GENERAL AND CAMEROON IN 
            PARTICULAR 
            TOPIC: POPULATION NUMBERS 
            Introduction  
            Population geography has become an important part among all other sub branches of human 
            geography since most geographers realize that the numbers, densities, and characteristics of 
            human population provide an essential background for all geography and equally serves as a 
            reference point from which all other geographic elements are observed and from which they 
            singly or collectively derive significance and meaning. 
            As a study of spatial variation in human population, this study involves absolute numbers, 
            population characteristics, its distribution, growth and mobility. In it simplest terms, it can be 
            defined as “a science that deals with the distribution, composition, occupational structure, 
            migration and growth or decline of population in time and space”. It is also considered as the 
            study of the distribution of people on the earth surface, the evolution of human societies and how 
            far these societies have succeeded overtime and space. 
            Demography which is the scientific study of aspects population especially the absolute numbers 
            and demographic processes such as fertility, mortality, growth rate, etc is most often confused 
            with population geography. But a clear cut difference exist between them as seen below. 
            Differences between population geography and demography 
             Population geography lay emphasis on the spatial variation in human population, their 
            characteristics and their relationship with physical, cultural and economic phenomena while 
            demography is concerned with mainly enumeration (head count) of population using absolute 
            numbers and employing statistical methods and demographic processes. 
             Demography is narrower in scope than population geography and is viewed as a single topic 
            in population studies. 
             Demography examines various physical, intellectual and character qualities of populations in 
            relation to quantitative aspects while population geography tries to unravel the complex 
            interrelationship between physical and human environment and population respectively. 
            
            
            2 
            Population is looked from the numerical point and how this number changes with time. To 
            determine the degree of change of this numbers, a number of sources or methods are used. These 
            methods have been grouped into two categories. That is; 
            o The static source, which helps to ascertain the distribution and structure of a population. This 
            include; censuses, sample surveys, population commissions and enquiries. 
            o The dynamic sources include vital registration, migration records, changes in population 
            structure, records of change in occupation, employment and others. 
            Based on this, the following four methods are widely recognized and used. 
            1. Census: This is the total process of collecting, compiling and publishing demographic 
            pertaining to all persons in a defined territory at a particular time. It also refers to the 
            complete count of the population in a given country at a particular time or period. 
            Earliest modern censuses took place in Scandinavia and some Germanic and Italian states during 
            the 18th century. The first general census in USA took place in 1790, Britain and France in 1801. 
            Census has become the most important, reliable and widely used source of population statics 
            today and the period when a census is conducted varies from country to country. For example, in 
            Cameroon, it is done after 10years, Britain 10years. Other countries do it after 5years. The last 
            census in Cameron was conducted in 2005. The persons who do the counting during censuses are 
            known as enumerators. Two approaches are used in census. 
            a) The ‘de facto’ approach: In this approach, the counting and recording of each individual is 
            done at the place where he or she is found at the time of the census. This method is used in 
            Britain. With this method, there is the danger of double counting because of population 
            mobility which may inflate population figures. It is also very expensive and time consuming 
            especially as people are always mobile. 
            b) The ‘de jure’ approach: Here, the counting and recording of people is done according to 
            their usual place of residence. This approach is used in the USA. It is less satisfactory due to 
            the multiple residences of some people, the homelessness of others and population mobility 
            as it may make some people not to be counted. However, both approaches are used in Brazil 
            so as to avoid the weaknesses of both methods and benefit from their advantages. The “de 
            facto’ method has proven to be the best as the enumerator visits each house and do a head to 
            head count. 
            Lesson 1: SOURCES OF POPULATION DATA 
            According to the UN, a good census should comprise of; 
             The total population 
             Sex, age composition and marital status 
             Educational qualifications and literacy level 
             Economic characteristics 
             Occupational distribution 
             Household or family structure 
             Nationality or place of birth or citizenship 
             Fertility 
             Urban or rural residence or housing structure 
             The population/resource level of combination. 
            Advantages of census. 
            o It helps the country to estimate the working population 
            o It creates temporal employment for those involved 
            o It ,makes it possible for the total population of a country to be known 
            o It helps the government in her socio-economic development plans. 
            Disadvantages of census 
            o It usually disturbs economic activities 
            o It is too expensive or costly especially to poor countries due to its broad spectrum. Because 
            of it expensive nature, countries like Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Yemen, Vietnam, etc 
            do not undertake it. 
            o Data obtained from censuses present a lot of inaccuracy since people can falsify information. 
            o There is the possibility of double counting and non-counting of some people. For example, 
            children in rural areas who die before registration. 
            o Delays in the publication of results so that information is outdated by the time the results are 
            published. 
            o Inadequacy as not all information can be recorded. 
            2. Sample Surveys: This involves taking a portion of the full population to be a worthwhile and 
            meaningful representation of that population. In other words, it is an exercise whereby a 
            small proportion of a population is taken to represent the total population of a region. With 
            3 
            this method, information that could have been provided by the entire population is provided 
            by the small proportion of the population and this information can be obtained by posing 
            questions directly to the population (interviews) or composing and administering 
            questionnaires whereby the population is expected to provide answers which would ease the 
            collection and compilation of data. Using this method, the first step is by constructing a 
            sample frame. A sample frame is the proportion of the population that may be taken to 
            represent the total population of an area. And choosing a sample frame that would represent 
            the phenomenon under study, remains the most difficult problem. 
            However, to make a sample as accurate a possible, certain methods such as; the use of points, 
            lines or areas have been developed. For this, information can be obtained either through 
            random or systematic procedures which can either be in strata (stratified sampling) or 
            clusters. This method is also used in USA 
            Advantages of sample surveys 
            o It is less time consuming and can allow for more rapid analysis and publication of results. 
            o There is a decrease in human labour input and this further reduces cost. 
            o It is very economical as costs can greatly be reduced without a substantial reduction in 
            accuracy. This is because only a small proportion of the population is interviewed. 
            o It adds more meaning to census data by supplementing. This is because it can be used even 
            within censuses in order to obtain more detailed information on some aspects or groups. 
            o In some cases, it is very accurate when carefully designed and carried out by experts. 
            Disadvantages of sample surveys 
            o The population can either be overestimated or under estimated in some regions leading to 
            faulty results. 
            o There is bias inherent in the procedure of sampling 
            o Difficulties of choosing a sample frame that will adequately cover the phenomenon under 
            study or which will be representative of the whole population. 
            3. Vital Registrations: This involves the continuous, compulsory and legal recording of vital 
            events such as birth, deaths, marriages, divorces, annulments, separations and adoptions. All 
            these indicate the nature and possible changes in population. This system is very operational 
            in developed countries like Belgium, Sweden, Netherlands, etc but hardly operational in 
            developing countries. In Cameroon ofr instance, people only register when they want to 
            obtain birth certificates, identity cards at the ages of 18 years and in most cases, if people 
            4 
            have not reached school going age or employment, they may not have a birth certificate and 
            in such cases they may even die without being registered. As such, it not an efficient method 
            of data collection in developing countries. 
            Generally, vital registration data tends to be more precise and accurate especially for births 
            and deaths than that of the census and sample surveys. However, the difficulty with the 
            continuous registration apart from the cost incurred is to ensure that migration into, out of 
            and within the country is sufficiently well covered. The sources of vital registration include; 
            health centres, divisional and sub divisional offices, councils (municipalities), electoral 
            registers, migration at frontier posts, airports and seaports. 
            4. Migration Records: This method provides a source of data for both internal and 
            international movements but their reliability is highly questionable. Internal movements for 
            instance are quite difficult to record given that movements are very arbitrary and with varied 
            reasons. It should be noted that in the past, data for internal movements came from analysis 
            of successive census enumeration after allowance has been made for natural increase. Today, 
            it is analysed directly from census results reasons being that censuses ask questions about 
            change of residence, place of birth which facilitate analysis. Generally, internal migration 
            data remain among the least accurate of all demographic data because enumerating migrants 
            is very difficult especially where they do not cross any significant administrative boundaries. 
            Statistics of international migrations are available for only a small minority of countries but 
            again very unreliable. These statistics are drawn from frontier control, port statistics, passport 
            statistics, work permit for aliens etc. however, and many international migrants still escape 
            enumeration especially where frontiers are long or poorly controlled. This makes it difficult 
            for accurate data to be obtained. 
            Lesson 2: Population Distribution 
            A. Meaning 
            Population distribution is the description of the manner in which people are spread on the earth 
            surface. It is therefore an attempt aimed at mapping and representing the visual spread of 
            population n umbers on the globe. However, there are many problems associated with the 
            concept. This is because preparation of its data suffers from much subjectivity. Thus in 
            considering areal representation of visual population data, (population distribution) great 
            importance is attached to population density as there is a very close link between them. It should 
            5 
            
            
            6 
            
            be noted here that population density will be our main focus here while population distribution 
            will be examine in the following lesson. 
            B. Concept of population density. 
            1. Meaning:  
            Population density refers to the ratio between the population size and a given size area expressed 
            per Km2. That is to say it is an expression of the ratio between population size and a given unit of 
            land usually per square km. It can also be referred to as the measure of the number of people 
            living in a specific unit of land expressed per square km, or the degree of compaction or 
            proximity in a population ie the closeness of people living on a given surface and the spatial 
            balance of their social and economic assets. It is calculated using the following formula. 
            PD = 𝑇𝑃
            𝑇𝐴
                Where: TP= Total Population 
                                        TA= Total land area. 
            It should be recalled here that not all places on the earth surface have the same densities. That is 
            there are places with high densities and high living standards (western Europe like Britain, 
            Germany,etc), regions with moderate densities but low living standards ( most Asian countries 
            like China, India, Indonesia, etc) and others with low densities and low living standards (Chad, 
            Burma, Brazil, New Guinea, etc). There are equally areas with low densities of below 25 persons 
            per km but with high living standards (Sweden, Norway, New Zealand etc). 
            2. Types and measurements of population densities. 
            a) Crude density: This is the commonest and widely used method. It is simply the direct 
            measurement of the total number of people living per unit area. 
            �
            �𝒓𝒖𝒅𝒆 𝑫𝒆𝒏𝒔𝒊𝒕𝒚= 𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝑷𝒐𝒑𝒖𝒍𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏
            𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝒍𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒂𝒓𝒆𝒂 
            From the crude density, the average population density can be calculated. Average population 
            density is thus expressed as the sum of the crude densities of various regions in relation to the 
            number of regions. It is calculated as: 
            �
            �𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦= ∑𝑃𝑑
            𝑛
            Where: ∑pd = Sum of population density of the regions 
                                                                                            n = number of regions 
            Significance of crude density 
            o It is a useful indicator of the concentration of people in specific areas 
            
            
            7 
            
            o It is a useful index of comparison between areas. This is only possible where areas in 
            question are not too dissimilar in human and physical conditions. 
            o It is a useful index for periodic comparison. That is to compare changes in population density 
            at different periods of time. 
            Weaknesses of crude density 
            o It does not give any indication of living standards 
            o It can also be very misleading as a measure of population distribution since it shows that 
            population distribution is even. 
            o It makes no difference between the population distribution of rural and urban areas. 
            o It does not consider the resources available in an area or the characteristics of the population. 
            That is why it’s called crude density. 
            b) Man/Land-use Density: This view was discovered that people tended to congregate more in 
            some areas and leaving large areas sparsely inhabited and less used. Here, some 
            modifications were made to the numerator which could be either the total population, 
            agricultural or working population. The denominator on the other hand can be the inhabited, 
            rural, cultivable, or an area weighted according to its land use. The following measures are 
            used here; 
            i) Nutritional Density: It is also known as agricultural density. It is the ratio between the total 
            number of people engaged in agriculture in an area and the total cultivated areas and not the 
            total land area. It is calculated thus; 
            N.D = 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
            𝐶𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎
            
            This gives the number of agriculturalists per unit of cultivated land area or man/cultivated land 
            ratio. For example, if an area has 10.000 people engaged in agriculture and the total cultivated 
            land is 5000km2, then the agricultural or nutritional density would be; 
            �
            �.𝐷.=10.000
            5000
            = 2 agricultural workers per square km of cultivated land. 
            From the index, when the value is low, it means there are few people on the cultivable land and 
            thus surplus land exists. But when the values are high, it indicates overcrowding on cultivable 
            land thereby indicating a situation of farmland shortage and hence high pressure on land. 
            
            
            8 
            
            Such densities are generally higher in Economically Less Developed Countries than in 
            Economically More Developed Countries given that more people are engaged in agriculture in 
            the former than the latter. 
            Significance of Nutritional Densities. 
             It usually gives a better indication of living standards. 
             It can also indicate the magnitude of land shortage or availability. 
             It can determine whether it is an intensive or extensive agricultural system being practiced.  
            Weaknesses of nutritional Density. 
             It is difficult to determine the real size of cultivable land. This is because its definition is 
            relative and varies even within the same country. 
             In some areas, cultivable and cultivated land is not distinguished. 
             It is difficult to determine the real size of the population engaged in cultivation of land. 
            With such weaknesses, the index is best suitable in countries of small population sizes of 
            the agricultural population eg Britain with less than 5%. 
            ii) Physiological Density: This is the ratio between the total population and cultivable land 
            areas or land suitable for agricultural purposes. In other words, it is the number of people per 
            unit of cultivable land. It is calculated thus: 
            �
            �ℎ𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝑃𝐷)=𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
            𝐶𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎 
            This gives the number of persons per square km of cultivable land. When the density is high, it 
            indicates that there is population pressure on the land. This index is index is very useful in 
            countries like Egypt where about 96% of the population lives on about 4% of the land area. This 
            requires that the land must be judiciously used since land not cultivated is not necessarily 
            unproductive. 
            iii) Comparative Density: This was advanced by Vincent, a French Geographer. It is a type of 
            physiological density which gives the ratio between the total population and land area 
            weighted according to its productivity. For instance 1 square km of cultivated land is equated 
            to 3 square km of grassland. It is expressed thus; 
            �
            �𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
            𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎′𝑠𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦

            Its main significance is that it indicates a country’s ability to be economically self-sufficient. 
            High values indicate that food imports are necessary while low values indicate that food could be 
            exported. 
            The major weakness of this index is that it can mislead a country to undertake a bad policy of 
            restricting food imports and encouraging only food exports. 
            iv) Population/Resource Density: This is the ratio between the population and the potential and 
            utilized resources of an area. Where the population exceeds the resources, it indicates a 
            situation of overpopulation, but if the population is too small, to utilize the resources, it 
            shows a situation of under-population. And where the resources can adequately sustain the 
            population leading to high living standards, it indicates an optimum population situation.  
            c) Occupational Density 
            This is a measure of a certain sector of a population over the total land area. That is the ratio 
            between particular sectors of the economy which employs the population and the total land area 
            of the country. For instance, number of industrial workers, teachers, doctors etc, over the total 
            land area. It may be calculated as follows:

            𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 
            d) Room Density 
            It is the average number of people per room in a given urban area. The number of people per 
            room in urban areas is usually higher than in rural areas partly as a result of the housing 
            problems and high rents. This is a very important index in urban areas because crude density 
            makes no difference between urban and rural areas. It is equally very important in 
            areas/countries (e.g. England, Wales, and Scotland) where the people spend a considerable part 
            of their lives indoors.  It is calculated as follows; 
            The total population of the given urban area divided by either 
            o The net area occupied by the dwelling lots and incidental services used or 
            o The gross area occupied by the dwelling lots and incidental services used (buildings, streets, 
            parks) or 
            o The total built-up area or 
            o The total urban area. 
            Significance of room density 
            - - - 
            It helps in the understanding of congestion in towns, housing conditions in urban areas and 
            overcrowding. 
            It reflects changes in housing conditions over space (regional and rural-urban variations in 
            these conditions) and time. 
            In Britain and Ireland, the values of room density are useful indices of not only housing 
            conditions but also occupational density. 
            Weaknesses of room density - - - - - 
            It is difficult to measure the actual surface area of storey buildings especially skyscrapters. 
            It ignores sizes of rooms which greatly influence density. Large rooms reduce density while 
            small rooms increase it. 
            It is only restricted to urban areas. 
            It indicates nothing about the concentration of people within buildings or houses. 
            It says very little on congestion especially where vertical expansion partially invalidates 
            man/land ratios. 
            Other measures of Density 
            They measure different aspects of the population and include; 
             Protein or vitamin intake 
             Income level or per capita income. This is calculated as; 
            �
            �𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑁𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡
            𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
             Possession of luxuries goods (general index of consumption) 
             Car density. An area with a high car density (number of motor vehicles per km2 or per 
            person) is likely to be more developed than one whose car density is low. 
             The Doctor/patient ratio. This is simply the number of patients per doctor. It is expressed as 
            follows; 
            �

            𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠
             Literacy rate (the teacher/pupil ratio). This is expressed as; 
            �
            �𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑙 𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑛

            Graphical and Cartographical Techniques used to Represent and Map Population 
            Distribution and/or Population Density 
            10 
            Maps or diagrams are generally employed to represent population distribution/density in visual 
            form. The kind of data and information available for any particular study will in part determine 
            the type of map or diagram which can be drawn. The techniques used in this domain include; 
            1. Population Density Lapse Rate 
            This shows the relationship between population density and distance as there exist a clear 
            relationship between population density and distance from the central point. Thus population 
            density lapse rate is techniques that show the decline in population density with increasing 
            distance away from a central point of concentration which may be an urban centre or the centre 
            of an industrial area. The rate at which population density declines with increase in distance from 
            the central point is known as Lapse Rate implying that the relationship between population 
            density and distance from the central point is inverse or takes the form of a negative exponential 
            relationship. The rate of decline varies from region to region and it is assumed to decline by a 
            factor of 10% for every kilometer from the central point. 
            The steepness of the curve indicates the rate of decline and the steeper the curve the faster the 
            decline and vice versa.

            Distance (km) 
            The above graph show that as distance increases away from 0 (central point), population density 
            declines eg at 5km density is about 43 persons per km2 while at 5km it falls to about 23 persons 
            per km2. This general tendency reveals that the concept of distance decay applies in population 
            density. But this smooth relationship does not apply in all cases as it is often distorted at road 
            11 
            junctions, suburban shopping centres and industrial complexes as a direct relationship is 
            observed where density instead increases with distance. 
            Variations in Population Density Lapse Rates 
            Population density lapse rate varies between the developed and developing countries given their 
            differential levels of socio-economic development, also from one decade to another. 
            a) Developed Countries (Western cities) 
            The lapse rate here is more gradual and it is usually illustrated by a gently sloping curve. This 
            means that the densities between the cities and distance away to the rural areas are not too 
            different. This gentleness is attributed to the following; 
             Long history of urbanization such that today most city centres are suffering from congestion, 
            pollution and expansion. This has caused an almost even spread of population from the 
            centre to the periphery. 
             Government action in discouraging rapid growth within the city by urbanization. 
             Urban redevelopment, creation of greenbelts, satellite dormitories and new towns to 
            decongest the cities. 
            Generally, population densities drop in the cities and gradually increase towards the 
            periphery because of the following: 
             Improvement in social welfare facilities in rural areas (educational, medical, electricity etc) 
             Urban problems like pollution, noise, high crime wave etc, encouraging out movement from 
            cities and increasing densities at periphery. 
             Improvements in living standards in rural areas so that urban dwellers are attracted.  
             People on retirement prefer to stay in calm and quiet rural areas. The graph below illustrates 
            this situation.

            Figure: Population density lapse rate in a developed country 
            The graph shows a gentle slope with population density gradually decreasing in the urban centre 
            and increasing towards the periphery as illustrated by the arrows. The future trend shows 
            continuous increase away from the urban centre and decrease in the urban area as illustrated by 
            the downward and upward arrows. 
            b) Developing Countries (Non-western cities) 
            The lapse rate here is very steep showing that population density is higher in the cities and very 
            low in rural areas. A greater concentration of the population is found in the urban centre and 
            decreases rapidly with increase distance towards the periphery. The reasons for this are; 
             Rapid urbanization leading to concentration of people in cities. 
             Low or few technological improvements in rural areas 
             Poor transport modes making it difficult for easy or faster movements. 
             Greater enonomic development in urban areas leading to the creation of employment 
            opportunities in industries, transport, commercial activities etc, attracts many people from the 
            surrounding regions. 
             Higher per capita income and living standards in urban areas compared with rural areas. This 
            can be illustrated in the following graph.

            The graph shows that a concentration of population in the urban area and the future trend shows 
            that there would be just a little change i.e small outward movement to the periphery. 
            2. Measure of Population Concentration. 
            The Lorenz Curve 
            Geographers in general are naturally interested in the unevenness or concentration of population 
            both at a given point in time and as an evolutionary process. The degree of concentration is 
            greatest where population is agglomerated at one point and least where it is scattered or 
            dispersed. One of the methods used to measure the degree of concentration is the Lorenz curve. 
            It is a diagrammatical expression of the inequalities of distribution of either(people, food, wealth, 
            political power, personal contentment, medical care, industry and other such socio-economic 
            assets) in any society. In other words it is a graph showing the percentage of a phenomenon (may 
            be wealth, population, land area, output, etc) enjoyed by each household. It was originally 
            devised for measuring the concentration of income or wealth but today it used to measure the 
            degree of regularity or exact levels of distribution of both societal and spatial phenomenon. 
            Types of Lorenz Curve 
            a) Spatial type: This measures population, land use and the number of industries on land. It is 
            useful in population studies to show the spatial distribution of population over land area. 
            b) Societal type: It measures wealth, income, medical care, political power, food, etc in a given 
            society. 
            14 
            How to construct the Lorenz curve 
             The area is divided into units or census districts. 
             The total population and the total land area of the study area are determined. i.e the 
            proportion of the total population living in each census district or unit and land area of each 
            unit are calculated and expressed as percentages of the total population and land area.  
            e.g 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑋 
            �
            �𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
            𝑋 100
            1
            the same is done for the land area. 
             The census districts are then arranged starting from one with the smallest area to the biggest 
            and in each case, the corresponding population percentages written beside. 
             The cumulative percentages of both land and population calculated must sum up to 100% 
             Produce a cumulative graph with the Y-axis for cumulative percentage of land area and the 
            X-axis for cumulative percentage of population starting your numbering from 0-100 in each 
            case. 
             After this, the cumulative values are then plotted and traced to produce the Lorenz curve.

            Figure: concave and convex Lorenz curve. 
            From the graph above, it ca be observed that the actual trace line or concave curve is the Lorenz 
            curve. It illustrates unevenness or inequality in population distribution and demonstrates the real 
            or true situation of population distribution. It actually shows that some areas are densely 
            populated while others are sparsely populated. The curve can either be concave or convex and 
            15 
            the greater the concavity or convexity of the slope, the greater the inequality or unevenness of 
            population distribution. 
            Uses or significance or Lorenz Curve. - - - 
            It can be used to compare the degree of population concentration or densities of several areas 
            or countries. 
            It is used to measure the degree of regularity or irregularity of distribution of phenomena in 
            space and time. 
            The concentration curves of succeeding census can be compared. 
            Limitations of the Lorenz Curve. - - - 
            Data on income, political power, output, etc are only estimates. 
            It is used only where an area can be divided into equivalent units (communes, parishes or 
            census districts) 
            The available population data is hardly accurate for the period of time. 
            3. Areal Representation 
            Here, the representation of population distribution/densities is carried out in various ways such as 
            through choropleth maps, isopleths, etc. a common characteristics of this methods is that they 
            suffer from subjectivity in preparation and ambiguity since the maps may not be viewed or 
            evaluated in the same way intended by the computer. As a way to reduce this weakness, most of 
            these methods are combined. These techniques include: 
            a) Chorochromatic maps: This technique is used to map differences in population distribution 
            by simple shading or colouring. Various shades or colours depict different densities or 
            population concentration in an area. In order to avoid confusion, the densities are grouped 
            into classes and these classes are assigned shades or colours which may be darker or lighter 
            depending on the densities. Also variation in the closeness of the shades would indicate 
            differences in densities. Such maps are very easy to produce and are non-quantitative and 
            simply portray the presence or absence of a particular characteristic over a given area e.g 
            population distribution.  
            16 
            Advantages of chorochromatic maps - - 
            They are easy to draw if thew density claseses are well defined. 
            It is easy to compare differences in densities between various regions within the same 
            country. 
            Disadvantages or weaknesses  - - - 
            Shading over vast areas may hide variation in densities 
            Poorly designed classes of densities or shades may bring confusion and make interpretation 
            difficult. 
            b) Choropleth Maps: in depicting densities by choropleth method, areas of relatively 
            homogeneous densities are plotted with no regards to political divisions using various shades 
            or colours and as such, a detailed picture of the variations in density from one place to 
            another is given. This is a widely used method to show differences in population density and 
            it is an example of a quantitative map. They are constructed using the following guidelines. 
            This method can as well be used to the mapping of urban populations since variations in 
            population densities occur in towns. - 
            Firstly, the entire data set has to be broken into meaningful classes. 
            Secondly, the resulting classes have to be related to the data collection areas. - 
            Thirdly, the classes have to be portrayed correctly in cartographic form by assigning each 
            class shades or colours which are  lighter or darker. 
            17 
            Advantages of choropleth map - - - 
            They are easy to read or interprete since spatial densities are visually compared. 
            They are easy to construct once the classes have been well set or grouped. 
            It makes the determination of densely or sparsely populated areas to be identified with ease if 
            well constructed thus facilitates governement policy of population re-distribution. 
            Disadvantages or weaknesses - - - - 
            It is difficult to determine a scale for choropleth maps. 
            They hide concentration of population within each unit area as it portrays an even 
            distribution over vast areas. 
            They portray abrupt changes in densities or sharp boundaries between areas of different 
            densities. 
            A poorly designed system of shading or colouring can make very small spatial differences 
            appear very large or make very great differences appear small, thus making interpretation 
            difficult. 
            c) Isopleths: This tehnique is used to depict population distribution or density and 
            characteristics on a continental or global scale or even within a particular country. Isopleths 
            are lines connecting places of the same population size of a particular region expressed in 
            person per km2. Isopleths are therefore combined with choropleths to give them more 
            meaing. 
            18 
            It should be noted that though choropleths have these weaknesses, they are better than 
            isopleths in representing population densities because population density is an areal value 
            and not a point value as indicated by the isopleth lines. 
            d) Dot Maps: This is a simplest form of symbol which appears to relate to a point of location. 
            On such maps, each dot is placed at the appropriate location or settlement and must be 
            equidistant as each dot reprpesents a certain number of people at that particular location. 
            Large dots depicts higher population numbers (500,000 to 1,000,000) and smaller ones 
            represent between (100,000 to 500,000). It should be noted that where there are man y 
            smaller dots in a particular area, each dot may represent 5000 to 10,000 inhabitants. The 
            greater the number of dots the higher the population density and the fewer the number of dots 
            the lower the population density. 
            Advantages of Dot maps. - 
            Population densities of various regions within the same country can easily be compared. 
            19 
            - - 
            They become very easy to construct when the value of the dot and the appropriate locations 
            have been determined. 
            They are easy to interpret since by simply counting of dots, examining the sizes of the dots or 
            the clustering of the dots, the population situation can be deduced. 
            Drawbacks or Disadvantages of Dot maps. - - - 
            Choosing a scale which will be convenient and appropriate is difficult. 
            It gives the impression that some areas are completely uninhabited. But in reality, these areas 
            inhabited but not have populations sufficiently large enough to warrant a dot. 
            Difficulty of deciding where to locate the dots. That is, when they refer to specific point 
            locations, the difficulty arises if two or more of such dots have to be located at the same point 
            as it is difficult to know which of the dots really does represent a particular location. 
            e) Proportional Symbols (Circles and Squares): These are symbols widely used to represent the 
            spatial variation of population density and distribution especially the population of urban 
            centres. They are usually drawn in proportion to the number of inhabitants they represent 
            (their sizes depends on the population size of the area), and once the scale is determnined 
            though difficult, the circles or squares are then placed over specific areas or points where the 
            population occurs. This is however done after the map has been drawn. The larger the size of 
            the circle or square, the higher the population and vice versa. This technique is also used to 
            show ethnic and occupational structures of population and migrations. 
            Advantages of Proportional Symbols - 
            It makes it easy to compare the population of many areas in a country. 
            20 
            - 
            It is easy to interpret as the sizes of the circles give the population size and makes it possible 
            to determine which areas are more populated or less populated. 
            Weaknesses or Disadvantages - - - - 
            The circles often refer to points whose locations cannot be precisely determined. 
            This method does not readily convey density of population. 
            There is great difficulty in choosing a scale. This is because it entails the calculation of the 
            radius of the circle. 
            The extreme range of population density to be found in many areas of a country/region often 
            leads to an overlap of the circles or squares and this makes(causes) a difficulty in the drawing 
            and interpretation of the map. 
            f) Divided Circles: They are also known as pie graphs. These circles vary in size according to 
            the respective totals of population under consideration. It should be noted that a circle is 
            made up of 3600. The larger the sector of the circle, the greater the population and vice versa. 
            In order to obtain the size of each sector, the formula below is used; 
            �
            �𝑖𝑧𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎(𝑒𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑎𝑏𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑜𝑟 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒)
            𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑠(𝑒𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑖𝑛 𝑎𝑏𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑜𝑟 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒)
            100
            180
            100
            X 3600 = 900. 
            ×360°
            NB: it is multiplied by 3600 because a circle is made up of 3600. For example, if a segment of the 
            circle represents 25% of the total population, it means it covers 25% of 3600 
            i.e 25
            This implies that 900 of the circle is occupied by 25 of the total population, meaning that the rest 
            of the 2700 would be occupied by the remaining 75% of the population. 
            On the other hand if a segment of the circle is 1800, to get the percentage of the population that 
            occupies this sector, this would be calculated thus; 
            X 100 = 50% 
            This implies that half of the circle (1800) is occupied by half of the population (50%). This 
            technique is illustrated I the following diagram. 
            21 
            Advantages of Divided Circles - - 
            Easy to interpret as the sizes of each sector of the circle depict the population number and 
            density. 
            Given that the population is shown in a single circle of 3600 comparisons can easily be made. 
            Disadvantages or weaknesses - 
            It portrays clear cut boundaries, a situation which is rare in the real world. 
            g) Columnar Diagram: It is also known as the bar graph or histogram. They are also used in 
            the representation of population data or densities especially in depicting regional or national 
            variations. Bar graphs normally have two axis (the horizontal and vertical axis). Here, the 
            scale must carefully chose to avoid construction and interpretation difficulties and once the 
            data is collected and scale chosen, the information can then  be presented diagrammatically 
            by drawing columns of appropriate lengths with towns or regions having highest densities or 
            population numbers represented first and then descends to towns with the lowest densities or 
            population numbers. 
            22 
            h) Population Potential: It is simply means the accessibility of people from a given point i.e a 
            measurement of how near people are to a point within a country. This measure assumes that 
            the influence an individual exerts is inversely proportional to distance from the central point. 
            This was suggested by Stewart in 1947 and then modified in 1960 by Warntz and Neft. 
            According to Stewart, population potential of a point refers to a measure of the nearness of 
            people to that point or as a measure of general accessibility or as a measure of influence of 
            people at a distance. It can be calculated using the following formula; 
            Population Potential =∑p/d 
            Where P=population at another point and 
            d=distance of that point from another 
            Example: The populations of 5 towns are shown and the method of calculation for the 
            potential at each place.

            23 
            Conclusion of the lesson 
            Statistical analyses have been devised to simplify complexities of population distribution. But 
            unlike linear distributions, areal distributions are less easy to analyse because of irregular sizes of 
            administrative units, mobility of population and variations in the physical environment. Looking 
            at the different methods, it would be realized that different methods results in both gain and loss. 
            The gain here is that it gives a different viewpoint of population distribution and a loss because 
            in it, there is the inevitable generalization of data. Despite this, they however remain necessary 
            when studying population distribution.

            Lesson 3: Spatial Population Distribution 
            Introduction  
            The distribution of people on the globe reflects the configuration of land (about 29%) and water 
            (71%) on the earth’s surface. Estimates reveals that only 11% of the land surface represents no 
            serious limitation to settlement and agriculture while the bulk of the remaining 89% is either hot 
            deserts, cold deserts, high or steep sided mountains and forests. This variation in the 
            characteristics of the earth’s surface has influenced the manner of spread on the surface of the 
            earth making man to choose particular spots to live in and avoiding others. 
            Spatial distribution of population therefore describes the manner or way I which the population is 
            spread out across the earth’s surface or particular regions thereof. World population has been 
            very dynamic in time and space as it can be seen that by 1850 it was about 1098 million, rose to 
            2730 by 1950, 1980 – 4,432 million and by the year 2000 it was slightly above 6 billion. The 
            most conspicuous feature about the spatial world population distribution is its extreme 
            24 
            unevenness. This unevenness is demonstrated by the fact that a glance at the world map of 
            population distributions shows areas with very dense population, some sparsely populated, others 
            moderately populated and others uninhabited. This unevenness can be seen in the following 
            analysis. 
            A) Variations at different spatial scales 
            1) Distribution at continental Level: This illustrates unevenness with some continents densely 
            populated, others moderately and others sparsely populated. For instance the African 
            continent had an estimated population of 345 million in 1969 and in the year 2000, it rose to 
            about 871.8 million, recording a total percentage of about 12.7% of global population. The 
            Asian continent on the other hand had an estimated population of 1988 million and 3548.1 
            million in both 1969 and 2000 respectively contributing to more than half of mankind having 
            55.9% and 58.3% respectively of the world population. It should be noted here that Asia and 
            Europe accommodate over three-quarters (about 75%) of the world’s population. From this, 
            it is clear that the Old world (Europe and Asia) is far more populated than the New world 
            (Africa, the Americas and Oceania).it should be noted here that these figures and proportion 
            are constantly changing since population is very dynamic. 
            2) Distribution at National Level: Disparity here is seen between and within nations. Between 
            nations, it can be observed that there is a contrast between nations (China, India, Japan, 
            Pakistan, etc.) with over 100 million people and nations with less than a million 
            people(Gabon, Swaziland, Djibouti, Botswana, etc). Within the national territory, unevenness 
            is also exhibited wherein some regions are densely populated while others are sparse. For 
            example in Cameroon, a greater part of the population is concentrated in the coastal 
            lowlands. Also in Egypt, about 96% of the total population live only on about 4% of its land 
            area i.e. concentrated along the Nile valley. 
            3) Distribution at latitudinal level: Generally, population densities decrease with increase in 
            latitudes i.e. more than 90% of the world’s population inhabit the Northern Hemisphere 
            while less than 10% live in the Southern Hemisphere. Still within these hemispheres, there is 
            a disparity in population distribution. For example in the northern hemisphere, less than 1% 
            of the population live North of latitude 600, about 50% live between 200N and 400N while 
            about 85% live between latitude 200N and 680N. It should be noted here that this Northern 
            hemisphere also contains the four major concentrations of humanity (south and south East 
            25 
            Asia, Europe, north eastern part of North America, and Coastal West Africa). In this area, 
            over 63% of the world’s population live on only 10% of the world’s land area. This 
            unevenness is due to the fact that this area contains the great deserts (sahara, Arabian) and 
            high mountain chains (Himalayas) of the world. 
            4) Altitudinal Distribution: Generally, population distribution with height shows a lapse rate. 
            That is the numbers and densities decrease with increase in altitude or height. On a global 
            scale, about 85% of the population lives in areas less than 500m high which is about 57% of 
            the land area. It should be noted that about 56.2% of the world’s population live between sea 
            level and 200m. 
            However, in tropical areas the situation slightly different as population densities in some 
            regions actually tend to increase with height up to a certain level before following the normal 
            pattern of lapsing with height. 
            5) Distribution with Distance from coast (sea): This is in line with the influence of insularity 
            (nearness to the sea) and continentality (distance from the sea). On a global scale, about 75% 
            (3/4) of the population live between the coast and 1000km inland, and 2/3 live between the 
            coast and 500km inland. It can therefore be concluded that a greater part of the world’s 
            population is concentrated along the coastal areas while inland, sparsely populated areas are 
            noticed. The main factors accountable for this disparity between the coast and inland areas 
            are differences in climatic conditions and commercial prospects. 
            6) Distribution at Regional scale: The unevenness at regional scale is very pronounced in the 
            continent of Asia where five countries (China, India, Japan, Pakistan, and Indonesia) have 
            half of the world’s population. This is a great contrast to the situation of West Africa which 
            has less than 10% of the world’s population but spreads across 15 countries. - 
            Notion of Habitable and Non-habitable space 
            Habitable (Ecumene) Areas or space: The term Ecumene refers to the inhabited portions or 
            regions of the earth. These inhabited areas are estimate to cover approximately 60% of the 
            earth’s land surface. - 
            Non-habitable (Ecumene) Areas or space: This refers to the uninhabited or intermittently 
            inhabited or very sparsely inhabited areas of the earth’s land surface. These areas include the 
            polar areas, hot deserts, dense forests, high mountain areas. They are estimated to cover 
            approximately 40% of the earth’s land surface. 
            26 
            The sparsely and Densely populated areas of the world. - 
            Densely populated areas: The very densely populated areas have high population densities 
            of above 50 persons per square km. the three primary concentrations that fall within this 
            domain include; 
            a) South-East Asia(China, India, Pakistan) with high growth rate having about 50% of the 
            population on less than 10% of the world’s  total land area. 
            b) Europe: This region constitutes the world’s third largest population cluster concentrated 
            mainly in Western Europe. It accommodates about 11% of the world population on less than 
            5% of the total land area. It however has a low growth rate. 
            c) North East America: This area accommodates about 4% of world population with low 
            growth rates. 
            It should be noted here that these three primary areas of concentration contain close to 70% of 
            the world’s population and beside them there are secondary concentrations of dense population 
            existing in pockets along the coasts of Africa (north and south), south America(east brazil and 
            some lowlands), and Oceania(Philippines, New Zealand etc). These zones constitute about 25% 
            of the world’s surface area. Tertiary population concentrations appear as “knots” as is the case of 
            the clusters of the high basin of Mexico or as “string” like along the Nile Valley and California.  - - 
            Moderately populated or intermediate areas: They have moderate densities ranging 
            between 10 and 50 person per square km. These areas include the interiors of Africa, south 
            America and Asia. Within this group, Africa has high growth rate while south America and 
            Asia have lower growth rates. 
            Sparsely populated areas:  These are areas with low population densities below 10 persons 
            per square km. these include mostly hot deserts, high mountains, the tundra region(Northern 
            Canada, Northern Russia, Iceland, Greenland and the Scandinavia), the tropical rainforest of 
            the amazon and equatorial Africa. All these areas put together accommodates just 25% of the 
            world’s population. It is worth noting here that areas of sparse population surpass those of 
            high population density. 
            B) Factors of Population Distribution 
            In looking for a plausible explanation to the unevenness or disparity that characterize the spatial 
            distribution of world population, we cannot subscribe to the purely deterministic viewpoint that 
            27 
            natural elements(factors) are the only controlling factors of population distribution as many 
            social, economic, political, demographic and historical factors play a vital role in population 
            distribution. This is as seen below. 
            1) Physical Factors 
            a) Climate: Generally, the manner in which humans are spread across the surface of the earth is 
            greatly influenced by the prevailing climatic conditions across the globe. This is seen in the 
            sense that extreme climatic conditions (too cold, hot and wet or hot and dry) repel human 
            habitation while conducive climatic conditions favour habitation. For example, the cold lands 
            (high latitudes 600-900) north and south of the equator are noted for their extreme (too cold) 
            conditions with frozen surfaces, low temperatures below freezing point, etc which all reterd 
            plant growth thus repelling human habitation. The hot dry regions on their part (150-350) 
            north and south of the equator exhibits aspects of repulsion though found within the tropics. 
            This is because these areas constitutes the main hot deserts(Sahara, Arabian, etc) deserts of 
            the world noted for their very high temperatures(350), low rainfall(250mm), making it 
            difficult for humans to carry out their activities smoothly.  
            On the other hand, areas with favorable climatic conditions like the low and middle latitudes 
            (00-300 and 300-600) or the hot-wet lands of the world, north and south of the equator are 
            noted for their high population concentration due to their favorable climatic conditions such 
            as high temperatures throughout the year (270), high relative humidity and abundant 
            sunshine, etc which supports plant growth and human settlement. It should however be noted 
            that there are areas within these hot-wet lands where we have low population densities like 
            the rainforest zones(Amazon and Congo basin, pacific islands), the presence of pest, 
            mosquitos have rendered these areas almost uninhabitable. But modern techniques have 
            permitted man to survive in these areas despite the extremes of climatic conditions. 
            b) Relief: With relief, population numbers and densities generally decrease with increase 
            altitude (height). About 85% of the world population live in areas less than 500m signifying 
            that high rugged mountains with steep slopes(Rockies, Andes, etc) repel population due to 
            the negative environmental conditions(cold weather conditions, barrenness of the soil, steep 
            slopes, etc) all repel human habitation especially in the middle and high latitudes. This is 
            because not all high altitude or mountainous areas are sparsely populated (e.g the Ethiopian 
            highlands, the western highlands of Cameroon, etc). In this case, latitude is of great 
            28 
            importance as it is asserted that the influence of mountainous areas or altitude on population 
            distribution depends on their latitudes. Still in highland areas, Aspect is another important 
            element of relief which exerts its influence on population distribution as insolation falls 
            unevenly on both slopes. Hence sun facing slopes (Adret) tend to have higher population 
            concentration than the sun shaded slopes (Ubac). This equally explains why south facing 
            slopes I the northern hemisphere are more populated than the north facing slopes. 
            In contrast to high altitude, low altitudes areas(lowlands) are generally attractive to human 
            habitation because they provide better environmental conditions such as fertile soils, well 
            drained land, contains a lot of natural resources, etc which all attracts human habitation. 
            However, there are exceptions to the general rule that lowlands are populated than 
            mountainous areas as there are some lowland areas with very sparse population densities e.g 
            the Amazon and congo basins. 
            c) Soil: Throughout history, different soils have exerted different degrees of influence on 
            population concentration. The general notion about soils and population concentration is that 
            regions of the world with fertile soils such as the chernozems of the steppes, prairies and 
            other grasslands, the volcanic soils of Ethiopian highlands and fertile alluvial soils found 
            along river valleys and plains(Ganges, Indu, Nile valley, coastal plains of Cameroon), have 
            all set the basis for large population concentration in these areas, though there exist minor 
            exceptions within these zones where there are patches of sparse population 
            densities/concentrations. 
            On the other hand, infertile soils of the world which might have resulted from excess erosion 
            or heavy leaching, are often associated with sparse population as they are unsuitable and 
            cannot support any meaningful agricultural activity. Examples of such soils are the podzols 
            of the cold continental temperate lands and the laterites of the humid tropics. However, the 
            attractiveness of soils also depends on man’s agricultural interest and techniques as infertile 
            soils I many areas have been made attractive with the use of chemical fertilizers thus 
            attracting population. 
            d) Drainage: drainage attracts and repels human habitation depending on the nature of drainage 
            in the area. In the former, it attracts population mostly areas where there is water scarcity(e.g 
            the sahel/desert regions), case of the Nile in Egypt which is known to cater for about 95% of 
            the entire population of Egypt for various uses like HEP generation, domestic use, fishing, 
            etc. 
            29 
            On the other hand, rivers and lakes may also repel population concentration as their courses 
            may be infested with pest and disease vectors such as mosquitos which causes malaria, black 
            fly which causes river blindness. Some rivers may be too liable to floods or too deeply 
            incised as to form gorges or ravines. While others maybe too torrential, narrow or wide. The 
            case of Ghana where river blindness (Onchocersiasis) has helped repel people from settling 
            along the valleys of rivers Volta and Tano. 
            e) Biotic Factor: Population distribution responds to varying distribution of plants and animals. 
            That different vegetation types like selvas, savannah, taiga and steppes influence different 
            human occupation and concentration. The role of this vegetation also varies greatly 
            depending on the climate and soil conditions. Hence dense forest regions (tropical rainforest 
            areas of Amazon and Congo basins, the northern forest lands of Northern Canada and 
            Northern Eurasia) are generally sparsely populated because of the difficulties presented by 
            this forest. 
            On the other hand, the tropical and temperate grassland areas (savannah regions, the prairies, 
            steppes) offer better conditions for human habitation. This is because they offer god 
            opportunities for agricultural activities (fertile soils) while some possess precious minerals 
            and accessibility is relatively easier as roads construction is easier. Thus human settlement 
            and other activities can easily be carried out. 
            f) Mineral and Energy resources: Mineral and energy resources exercise a powerful influence 
            upon population distribution especially where there is the technical know-how and social 
            organization to prospect and exploit them. The presence of minerals like iron ore, coper, 
            bauxite, coal, etc has both in the past and present encouraged human activities in areas where 
            they are found. For example, coal has attracted large population concentration because it has 
            exerted a much greater stimulus to industrial location especially in the past as it was the only 
            available source of energy leading to the development of settlements like the Rand of South 
            Africa, Ruhr Westphalia in Germany, etc. It should however be noted that the influence of 
            coal has dropped today due to the development of new energy sources like HEP, nuclear 
            power, etc. therefore, mineral and energy resources vary in their ability to attract population 
            concentration depending on their quality, quantity, value to industrial production, etc. 
            generally in areas where mineral are absent, there is hardly any population concentration and 
            densities are low. This is the case of Paraguay in South America. 
            30 
            2) Human Factors: Economic activities such as agriculture, industrial activities, commercial 
            activities, transport exert a great influence on the distribution of the world’s population as the 
            type and scale of these activities exercise enormous control on the spatial distribution of 
            population as dense population corresponds to areas of advanced economic activities while in 
            areas of backward economic activities, population distribution is sparse. Agriculture for 
            example influence population in the sense that areas with intensive subsistence and 
            commercial systems (eg, the Ganges valley, Western highlands of Cameroon etc) have high 
            densities while areas with extensive subsistence (eg, Amazon and Congo basins areas, part of 
            Malaysia etc) have sparse or low population densities.  
            3) Historical factors: It is evident that past population distribution influence present and will 
            probably influence future distributions as in examining the age of settlement in any area has 
            often been loosely concluded that “regions of ancient civilization are usually areas of high 
            population densities”. This implies that regions of the world that have old civilization (eg, the 
            Nile and delta in Egypt, Far north region of Cameroon, China and India, etc) tend to have 
            high concentration of people. This is because of early human history (population inertia) that 
            has attracted many people over the years, sustained births and advanced levels of 
            development. 
            On the other hand, relatively recent settlements tend to have low population densities. This is 
            the case of the new world areas as Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, etc which is due 
            to the harsh climatic and poor soil conditions 
            4) Social factors: Here we are basically referring to the effects of various disasters (both natural 
            and man-made) and religious influence. Disasters for example usually cause short-term 
            adjustments and redistribution of population. This is because they happen suddenly and so 
            surviving population move out (out migration or emigration e.g Lake Nyos disaster of 1986, 
            cyclones in Eastern Europe and Caribbean’s, etc). 
            On the other hand, social disaster (man-made) tend to produce greater and more long lasting 
            consequences for example the trans-Atlantic slave trade left most of Africa sparsely 
            populated, the operation Zionist that took jews all over the world back to Palestine, etc 
            5) Government policy: Government policy has also influenced the distributional pattern of 
            population and it has contributed to the settlement and re-settlement of population in certain 
            parts of countries. This is evident through the creation of facilities and economic structures 
            especially in depressed areas so as to enable population over spill to resettle and thereby 
            31 
            relieve many large cities from the problems of congestion and overcrowding. Government 
            has also created residential quarters at the outskirts of major cities (dormitory towns), new 
            towns, and encouraged industrial development in depressed areas. 
            On the contrary, regions which have been neglected by the government with little or no 
            investments are often sparsely populated. This is the case of the interior of Brazil and the 
            south eastern part of Cameroon. 
            Conclusion 
            To effectively discuss the spatial distribution of world population, two sets of factors 
            (physical and human) must be considered not in isolation but as inter-related influences on 
            population distribution. The significance of these elements varies in time and space since 
            population distribution is a dynamic process and the effects of human factors are so strong 
            today that we cannot subscribe to the purely deterministic viewpoint which holds that natural 
            elements are the controlling factors of population distribution. 
            TOPIC: POPULATION STRUCTURE/COMPOSITION 
            Lesson 5: Population Structure 
            A) Meaning of population composition/structure 
            Population composition or structure refers to those aspects of population which may be 
            measured and for which data are usually obtained either from censuses or vital migration. 
            These aspects include; Age, Sex, marital status, economic composition, size and composition 
            of families and households, nationality, language, religion and ethnic composition. These 
            aspects are sometimes termed the quantitative aspects of population studies which contrast 
            with the qualitative aspects like physical and psychological characteristics, social and cultural 
            groupings. 
            B) The various components. 
            1. Demographic: This examines all the age-sex composition of a population at a given time 
            period. That is the different age groups (infants and adolescents, adults and the aged/old) in a 
            population and the number of males and females or the proportion of males or females as a 
            decimal (sex composition). A detail of these components will be seen in the subsequent 
            lessons. 
            2. Socio-political: These are aspects of the population which can be identified when 
            populations are divided into superficial and personal attributes. That is to say they are the 
            32 
            acquired (individual) aspects of the population and are grouped into language, religion, 
            nationality, culture, marital status, political affiliation, living conditions and even alliance to 
            team sports. Here, we are going to dwell on marital status, religion and language for social 
            characteristics and nationality for the political. 
            a) Marital status: This refers to the proportion of persons who are either single, married, 
            widowed or divorced in a given population. It is one of the important aspects of population 
            structure which should be taken into consideration when discussing population growth of a 
            country and more emphasis is laid on; single population (the proportion of people who have 
            never been married before and are still not married), marriage (a legal union between two 
            persons of the opposite sex as husband and wife established by civil, religious or traditional 
            means. Marriage can either be monogamy or polygamy), widowhood (the state of a single 
            person existing in a population because of death of a partner), and divorce (which is the 
            legal separation of once married couple). Factors influencing marital status include: age 
            structure, sex ratio, economic condition, literacy level 
            b) Religion: Religion may be referred to as an attempt to explain the nature and mystery of 
            life. Zelinsky noted that amongst the numerous definitions of religion, we must include; “a 
            mental complex, a highly diversified body of customs, a formal institution i.e church or 
            denomination and a group of persons sharing some degree of religious identity by virtue of 
            tradition or common observance”. Most religions involve procedure of faith and worship, 
            normally of a God and usually encompass secret observances and codes of behavior. The 
            most dominant religious groups in the world today include; Christianity (common in 
            Europe, America, Africa and other regions of European settlement), Islam (over Arabia, 
            northern Africa and western Asia), Buddhism (in central Asia), Hinduism, Bahai, Judaism, 
            Shinto and Confucianism.  
            c) Language: The term is rather ambiguous, as a lack of uniform classification languages has 
            impeded the comparison of linguistic data between different countries. The languages of the 
            world are extremely diverse. Today, they number about 2800 and often numerous dialects. 
            Many languages belong to the same stock or family and also, have a common decent. Some 
            include the Indo-European, Sematic, Dravidian and Malayo-Polynesian. These vast 
            divisions of this family of languages are symptomatic of the rapid evolution and 
            diversification of language e.g many changes in languages are due to invention and many 
            are due to changing modes of life. Languages are closely related to the environment, race, 
            33 
            culture and history. These factors are however not constant this is because human migration, 
            intermixture and natural changes have made the world patterns of languages to continually 
            change. 
            d) Nationality: The term “nation” is often used geographically to denote a group of people 
            who are conscious of their own nationality i.e a people with common sentiment, tradition, 
            territory who wish to maintain their cultural unity free from political domination. It is a 
            concept that reflects the natural political status of the country to which a person belongs in a 
            legal sense, it refers to a country of citizenship. This can be achieved true birth and through 
            nationalization. 
            3. Economic Composition: The economic composition of the population being a non
            demographic aspect of population, can be identified when people are divided according to 
            attributes of living standards that is to aspects of achieved status characteristics. Population 
            can therefore be grouped by occupations and employment and also by such livelihood criteria 
            as wealth, income, working hours and spending decisions. Under this aspect, more attention 
            would be focused on the active population, its industrial and occupational structure and 
            socio-economic composition. 
            a) Active population: In it strict and official sense, active population comprises of all those 
            who are engaged in remunerative occupations (earn pay as wages or salaries) such as in 
            primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary activities and who seek a livelihood in such 
            occupations. The size of the working population varies widely and is affected by both 
            demographic and socio-economic and political factors. The working or active population is 
            also fairly closely related to the size of the total population and the age structure. That is to 
            say, in young rapidly growing populations of developing countries, the active population 
            tends to be small and there is “heavy youth dependency” because of the high proportion of 
            children and mainly boys and old men play a great role in the economy of such countries. On 
            the other hand, advanced ageing at the apex and the base creates a state of “heavy old-age 
            dependency”. 
            b) Occupational structure: The occupation of an individual refers to his/her trade, profession, 
            or type of work and can be classified under primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary 
            activities. This structure is also determined by socio-economic factors and changes with 
            socio-economic progress in the society. There is therefore a variation between developed 
            countries with advanced economies and developing countries with backward economies. In 
            34 
            developing countries(Cameroon, Brazil etc), the proportion of people involved in the primary 
            sector (agriculture, mining, hunting etc) is very high (about70%) while in the developed 
            countries (USA, Britain, etc) this proportion is low (less than 5%. 
            c) Industrial composition: The industrial classification of the active population refers to 
            branches of activities and it is based on the type of establishment, product made or service 
            rendered. However, the list of industries is very long and there are complications in their 
            classification these complications are compounded as a result of the diversity of 
            establishments within any industry and the rapid birth and growth of industries. For easy 
            understanding of the industrial composition, it is analysed in three main groups i.e primary 
            activities (agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting), secondary activities (manufacturing, 
            production of electrical power and gas and construction), tertiary activities (commerce, 
            transportation, communication and services of all kinds), quaternary activities (includes 
            education and training services). - 
            Lesson 6: Age and Sex composition 
            A) Meaning: Age structure of composition refers to the proportion of people contained within 
            the various age groups. The age structure varies from one country to another and also within 
            countries. It is influenced by variables or parameters such as mortality, fertility and 
            migration, which are highly interrelated. Here, the population of every given country is 
            divided into three main groups i.e infants and adolescent (young or youthful), Adults and the 
            Aged or old. 
            Sex composition or structure on the other hand refers to the number of males and females 
            in the total population of a country. In other words, it is an expression of male/female 
            proportions in a total population. It can be expressed in a number of ways such as; - 
            The number of males per 100 or 1000 females or vice versa or males or females as a 
            percentage of the total population. 
            As a proportion males or females as a decimal of unity (where males and females are equal). 
            B) World patterns of Age and Sex composition. 
            Looking at the age structure of the world population, it can be noticed that the percentage of 
            population found in each age group varies with different countries and with regions. In the case 
            of the developing countries for example, the population is mostly dominated by the young or 
            youthful (young and adolescents 0-19years) constituting about 40% of the total population. This 
            35 
            is typical of the Asian, Latin America and African countries where birth rates and mortality rates 
            are high and as a result of this high mortality rate, very few people attain old age (beyond 
            65years). On the other hand, the More Economically Developed Countries tend to experience the 
            direct opposite of a growing population i.e they are faced with an ageing population which in 
            recent years has been on an increase. An ageing or aged population is a population dominated by 
            old people (beyond 65 years) constituting about 15% of the total population. This is typical in 
            countries such as USA, New Zealand, Australia, etc. People in these countries live longer 
            because of decreased mortality which as a result of improved medical facilities, good diet and 
            sanitary conditions. 
            Like age composition, the sex ratio varies from country to country but the degree of disparity is 
            not as great as the former. Generally speaking from a world view, females are more than males 
            except in countries in countries where factors like wars and migration have distorted the pattern. 
            In most developed countries like Britain, there are more females than males (106 females per 100 
            males). Same with Japan and Indonesia where the number of females slightly outnumber males. 
            The situation is not different in developing countries as females are more than males. In 
            Cameroon for example, (987 census), females constituted 51% while males 49% of the total 
            population. However, there are some few disparities where males outnumber females like in 
            China, India, and Pakistan. Within country levels, disparities occur in areas like military and 
            mining areas where men outnumber women. While in tourist resorts, women outnumber men due 
            to the nature of opportunities available there.  
            Factors Explaining Differential Sex-composition. 
            1. Preponderance (Excess) of male births but higher pre-natal deaths: Generally, male 
            births usually exceed female births in most societies. The excess is even greater at 
            conception although towards the later ages, women tend to outnumber men. A world trend 
            show that the average sex ratio at birth is about 105males: 100 females. The causes of this 
            trend are not certain but generally accepted that it is a biological phenomenon. Social factors 
            may also help explain it as in some societies, the desire for male children influences sex 
            ratios. This leads to discriminatory or selective abortion and female infanticide (e.g in China 
            the one-child policy). Despite these excess of males over females at birth, the trend does not 
            continue for a long time. The number of males is greatly reduced as time goes by. This is 
            due to the fact that they suffer from a higher pre-natal mortality.  
            36 
            2. Mortality differences of the sexes: Disparity exist between sexes in the three age groups. 
            Statistics show that in all these age groups, male mortality is higher than that females. i.e at 
            childhood, the mortality rate for males is about 10 to 20% especially in developing countries 
            but lower in developed countries. At the middle age group (between 30-44 years), the 
            situation is almost balanced. However, great disparity sets in again at the old age group 
            (above the age of 60). This disparity can be explained by a combination of both biological, 
            environmental and socio-economic reasons. Biologically, men are a weaker sex since they 
            contract a greater number of diseases than women. Nature of jobs, marital ages, effects of 
            war, road accidents, is some the reasons why mean die earlier than women. In some 
            countries like in South East Asia and parts of Africa, female deaths however exceed those of 
            males. This is because of low status of women, the frequent occurrence of deaths during 
            delivery, and their involvement in heavy work since they have high socio-economic burden. 
            3. Effects of migration: The imbalance in the sex ratio, characterizes many countries can also 
            be explained by sex-selective effects of migration. Generally, men are more mobile than 
            women especially in the adult age groups. As such, areas experiencing net immigration are 
            likely to have more males than females. This was the case during the trans-oceanic 
            migrations in the 19th and 20th centuries with great immigrant countries like the USA, 
            Canada, etc received more males than females. On the other hand, areas experiencing net 
            emigration will tend to have more females than males. 
            Importance of sex ratio - - - - 
            It influences the marriage type (polygamy where the imbalance is great, and monogamy 
            where it is fairly balanced) 
            It influences the rate of fertility and mortality. 
            Determines the role of women in the society. In areas where men dominate, women take 
            some risky activities as they are few e.g Israel, Libya, etc. 
            For social effects, where women dominate, prostitution is common than where fairly 
            balanced. Crimes as rape may be common where men dominate. 
            C) Youthful or Expanding Population: This is a situation in a country where the youths form a 
            bulk of the population (constituting over 40%) while the aged form only a smaller proportion 
            (less than 5%) of the entire population.  The former is composed of those who fall between 0
            19years i.e it is subdivided into infants (0-12 years) and adolescents (13-19 years). 
            Economically, this group is grossly non-productive and biologically non-reproductive or 
            37 
            - - - - - - - - - - - - 
            marginally reproductive. It is generally considered a dependent age group because it 
            contributes little or nothing to the socio-economic development of the country as most are 
            school children. This is associated with the developing countries of Asia, Latin America, 
            Africa where birth rate and mortality are high. However, the introduction of medical facilities 
            has reduced mortality rate leading to an increase in this age group. This type of population is 
            associated with the following consequences. 
            Large population growth in the feature as young people grow up to childbearing ages. 
            High rate of unemployment as the rate of population growth is not accompanied by economic 
            development.  
            High dependency ratio is an important characteristic of such populations. This is because the 
            number of people dependent on the active or working population is very high and this may 
            result in low living standards. 
            Low per capita income leading to low standards of living. 
            High government expenditure on the provision of services needed by the young especially 
            educational and health services. This may provoke over taxing of the working population so 
            as to raise government revenue. 
            There would be a growing burden on the country’s agricultural or food supply systems.  
            The government of any country experiencing a youthful population has however taken 
            measures aimed at reducing the negative consequences of such populations as follows: 
            Encourage out migration or immigration. 
            Intensification of agriculture with the use of a lot of farm inputs. 
            Creation of industries to provide employment avenues. 
            Rural resettlement and development schemes. 
            Measure to introduce birth control programmes in an attempt to stabilize population 
            numbers. The implementation of these measures in countries like China, India, Pakistan, 
            Brazil, etc.  
            Creation of more schools and hospitals.  
            D) Ageing or Greying Population: An ageing population is that in which there is an increasing 
            number of the aged and a decreasing number of the young. In other words, it is a population 
            with a large population of aged persons and a smaller proportion of young persons. This is 
            mostly associated with the economically and demographically advanced countries such as 
            Japan, USA, Germany, Belgium, etc. Such countries have attained the fourth stage of the 
            38 
            
            
            39 
            
            demographic transition model with low birth and death rates. The number of people above 
            65-70 years in these countries continues to increase, thus high life expectancy.  
            Reasons for an Ageing Population.  - Improvement in medical facilities -   Better nutrition/diet. - High level of economic development - Improved sanitary or environmental conditions. - Desire to maintain high standards of living, thus few children. - Better catering facilities especially in old homes created by government and therefore leading 
            to high life expectancy. 
            Consequences of an Ageing population 
            a) Demographic consequences 
            Positive - Rise in life expectancy given the many old people. This is mainly because of the 
            improvement in medical facilities which have greatly reduced mortality and increased the 
            number of years an individual lives from birth. - Greater migration from urban areas to retirement villages (or rural areas) 
            Negative - An increase in the proportion of old people in the population increases the mortality rate. The 
            older a person is, the greater likelihood of the person dying. - Very small growth rate or natural increase mainly because of the low fertility and to an extent 
            increase in mortality rate of the aged. - Increase in dependency ratio as dependence is contributed more by the old people. 
            b) Social consequences  
            Positive - Increase in retirement age. This is because of the labour shortage in such a population as a 
            result of the few young people to take over the various jobs. This therefore necessitates a 
            prolongation in the number of years of the working population resulting in an increase in the 
            retirement age. - A drop in mortality and fertility keeps population low. Thus, the slow rate of population 
            growth is advantageous in that it avoids all the defects of a youthful or expanding population. 
            
            Negative - - - - - - - - - - - 
            There will be a drop in the number of school children mainly because of the drastic decrease 
            in birth rate (baby dust). This may explain the reason for the low average number of children 
            per class in developed countries compared to the situation in schools in developing countries. 
            Increase in social insecurity burden. In most countries where ageing population is 
            experienced, the government provides facilities like health care, pension, education, free 
            accommodation, unemployment benefits, etc. This social security burden continues to grow 
            as more people become dependent rather than producers. 
            Little or underutilization of social amenities like schools, entertainment spots, etc given the 
            few youths. 
            A rise in the dependency ratio threatens living standards. This is because there is a possible 
            reduction in output per head (income per capita). 
            Possible inflow of immigrants from different countries 
            Retirement villages become growth points in social infrastructure as the number of the aged 
            and the retired grow each day. 
            c) Economic consequences 
            Positive  
            There would be greater technological development in the production of industrial and 
            agricultural products. These automatic systems are compensated for shortages in able men. 
            There is an increase in the demand for goods needed by old people such as walking sticks, 
            hat, blankets, pipes and wheel chairs. 
            There is a low labour mobility since geographical and occupational mobility of youths and 
            young adults is limited. This is however advantageous because there is stability in economic 
            life. 
            Retirement villages become growth poles in development of industries producing products 
            for the aged, small trading centres, other socio-economic facilities develop. 
            Negative 
            Increase in pension bills given that there are many old people who are on retirement despite 
            the fact that some developed countries like Germany have increased the retirement age of 
            workers. 
            40 
            - - - 
            There will be a shortage in labour force especially for technical and labour intensive jobs 
            because of birth control reducing the number of youths who would grow up to adult or 
            working age group. 
            Manufacturers of baby good and foods will face a severe slump and most may go out of 
            production while manufacturers of products needed by the old will face a boom. 
            Consumption pattern also changes with ageing in terms of food, industrial goods, medical 
            and housing requirements. 
            Lesson 7: Concept of Age-Sex Pyramid or Population Pyramid 
            A) Meaning and types 
            A population pyramid is a frequency distribution histogram of the population a specific area or 
            country set on a vertical axis showing the various age groups and a horizontal axis which depicts 
            the absolute numbers or percentages of the two sexes (male and female), with males represented 
            on the left and females on the right. In other words, it is a graphical technique used to show the 
            age and the sex structure of a population with a vertical axis representing the age groups and a 
            horizontal axis depicting the percentage or number of the two sexes with males on the left and 
            females on the right. 
            Types of Age-Sex Pyramids 
            1. Progressive or Expansive Pyramids:  This pyramid is characterized by a broad (expanding) 
            base, concave sides and narrows towards the apex. In this pyramid, both birth and death rates 
            are high although death rate is declining. children form a very large number (45 -50%) of the 
            total population while the old or aged forms a small proportion (4-10%). This is the case of 
            most developing countries of Africa, Latin America, Asia, excluding Japan and CIS. 
            41 
            2. Regressive or Contractive (Constrictive) Pyramids: This pyramid is characterized by a 
            narrow base, a central section that bulges out with convex sides and a wider apex. This gives 
            it a “bell” or “beehive” shape. Here, both birth and death rates are low and declining. 
            Children form a very small proportion (about 30%) of the total population while the aged 
            accounts for above 15%. This type of pyramids are common in most developed countries 
            especially those of Western Europe (Germany, France, Britain, etc.), USA, Canada and 
            Japan. The narrow base showing the existence of few children is mainly because of low birth 
            rate as a result of stiff birth control. The bulging of the middle section indicates the presence 
            of many adults and the wide apex depicts large number of the aged. This is as a result of high 
            living standards, high quality diet, etc. 
            3. Stationary or Static Pyramids: It has a roughly equal number of people in all age groups 
            characterized by a narrow base, convex sides and a wider top. These are not as pronounced as 
            in the regressive pyramid. Here the population has an unchanging low fertility and mortality. 
            Children account for about 35-40% of the total population and the aged account for about 
            10%. The low or declining fertility is due to birth control measures while the low mortality is 
            as a result of better medical facilities, good diet and sanitary conditions. There is therefore a 
            relatively longer life expectancy, low dependency ratio and slow and stable or constant 
            population growth. This is common in most developed countries especially in major cities. 
            42 
            4. Intermediate or composite pyramids: This pyramid has characteristics of progressive and 
            regressive pyramids. This is common in countries that are undergoing some demographic 
            evolution or passing through stages of development. Here, the implementation of birth 
            control measures helps to reduce fertility while improvements in medical technology reduces 
            the high death rate and increase the number reaching middle and old age groups. Examples of 
            countries experiencing this type include: Argentina, China, Cuba, and Mexico.  
            B) Factors Influencing the shapes of Age-Sex Pyramids. 
            i. 
            Demographic factors 
            1. Fertility and Mortality: These are important demographic factors which affect population 
            pyramids as any change in them affects the population growth and thus cause a change in the 
            age-sex pyramid. For example, in case where birth and death rate are declining as a result of 
            birth and death control, there will be a slow population growth. This often takes place over a 
            43 
            long time and would lead to an increasing proportion of the aged a declining proportion of 
            children that is an ageing population. This will give rise to a pyramid with a wide apex 
            showing a higher proportion of the older age group due to good medical facilities and narrow 
            base showing less number of children. The reverse is true for a case where birth rate remains 
            high and death rate is declining as in many economically developing countries. 
            2. Migration: Migration is sex selective especially over long distances where only the male 
            adults are mostly concerned. In countries where there is the large influx of this age/sex 
            group, it will immediately cause a bulge on the male side of the population pyramid at the 
            middle in the short run. For example during the trans-oceanic migrations of the 19th and early 
            20th centuries, the USA, Canada experienced this. On the other hand, the areas which have 
            experienced the massive out migration suffer drastic reduction in their young adults males. 
            This produces an indentation on the male segment of the pyramid indicating a loss in this age 
            group. This was the experienced in most African countries during the trans-Atlantic slave 
            trade. 
            ii. Non-Demographic Factors. 
            1. Marital behavior: It varies from region to region and this affects the nature of population 
            pyramids. For example in countries where the tradition of early and polygamous marriages is 
            strong as in many developing countries of Africa, Asia, this will lead to rapid population 
            growth due to high birth rate. This also applies in countries where a high proportion of 
            married people exist. All this will lead to a youthful population producing broad based 
            population pyramids. On the other hand, countries where monogamous and late marriages 
            dominate as in developed countries, fertility or birth rate is lower and reduces growth rate. 
            This produces narrow base pyramids as in regressive pyramids. 
            2. War: When breaks out in any region, the short-term effect would be the death of people 
            affecting all age and sex groups. There is however some sex selectiveness in the deaths as the 
            most affected are the adult males. This is because those involved in fighting wars are 
            dominantly the adult males who make up the bulk of the armed forces. This generally leads 
            to shrinking of the population pyramids and serious indentations on the adult male segment 
            of such pyramids. 
            3. Famine: It results from drought or crop failure which may affect the sizes and shapes of 
            population pyramids as it may either lead to an increase in the number of deaths especially 
            when it persist for a long time or triggers off out migration (emigration). The effects of 
            44 
            famine are however age selective. That is to say, the immediate effects children and aged 
            (old people) die first. This is because they are less resistant to hunger as compared to the 
            adults thus more vulnerable. This therefore reduces the proportion of these age groups and 
            may narrow the base and apex of the sex-age pyramid while leaving the adult section 
            unchanged. 
            4. Population policies: Population policies varies from country to country and affects 
            population pyramids differently. Governments of some countries especially developing 
            countries have instituted policies such as prohibition of birth control, non-legalization of 
            abortion, giving of family allowances and marriage loans. All this has resulted to rapid 
            population growth giving rise to a broad base pyramid. This is evident to most African, Latin 
            America and Asian countries. On the other hand, population policies in developed countries 
            are anti-natalistic i.e these are policies aimed at reducing birth rate and limiting population 
            growth. Countries practicing this include; USA, Canada, Japan, Germany, etc. The 
            implementation of these measures has led to narrowing of the base of their population 
            pyramids (regressive pyramids). 
            5. Improved medical services: This implies the availability of good medical equipment, drugs, 
            better vaccination programmes, etc. this affects the mortality and fertility rate. The 
            immediate or short-run effect would be a drastic reduction in death rate. In developing 
            countries, this would greatly increase the number of surviving children and would result in 
            broad base pyramids (progressive pyramids). On the other hand, a reduction in infant 
            mortality especially I developed countries greatly reduces the need for a lot of children. This 
            may lead to a fall in birth rate and produces narrow base pyramids. In the long run. Such 
            improvement in medical services will lead to higher life expectancy at birth resulting in a 
            greater and increasing proportion of the population reaching old age, producing narrow base 
            and broad top pyramids (regressive pyramids). 
            6. Economic depression: In the short-run, there would be a drop in the volume or size of the 
            population pyramid. This is because the resultant unemployment provokes massive out 
            migration of those in the working age group thus population pyramid would have a 
            constriction at the middle and it would be more pronounced at the male section given that 
            males are more migratory. In the long run, a baby dust may occur. This is because the 
            continuous outflow of young adults would reduce the birth rates. 
            45 
            7. Natural disasters (Environmental Hazards): Natural disasters like earthquakes/Tsunamis, 
            volcanic eruptions, floods and unexpected droughts often cause the death and out migration 
            of many people affecting all age and sex groups. This often reduces the size of the population 
            pyramids on both sides given that the whole population is affected. 
            8. Epidemics: These are large scale diseases that have rapid spread e.g cholera, measles, 
            meningitis, flu, HIV/AIDS etc. They have short and long term effects on population 
            pyramids of many countries especially those in the developing world where medical facilities 
            are still poor. The effects of diseases like cholera, measles, meningitis, are generally age 
            selective as they are more pronounced in infants leading to high infant mortality thereby 
            causing the base of the age-sex pyramids of such regions to be narrow. 
            C) Indices of Population Structure. 
            1. Dependency Ratio. 
            This is the ratio of the young (children) and the aged (the non-active) to the working (active or 
            adult group. In other words, it is the proportion or ratio of people in the population who 
            contribute little or nothing to the socio-economic development of the country (i.e young and 
            aged) to those who contribute (i.e. adults). It therefore measures the working population and the 
            dependent population. It is calculated thus: 
            Young (0−19)+𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑑(65+)(𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡)
            Adults (20−64)(active age)- 
            It should be noted that when dependency ratio is calculated and the result is above 1 or 100%, it 
            means that the non-active population outweighs the active population and the burden would be 
            high. This is the case with LEDCs. On the other hand, when the dependency ratio is less than 1 
            or 100%, it means that the active population outweighs the non-active and there would be great 
            reduction in the burden. This is typical of MEDCs. 
            Assumptions of Dependency Ratio. 
            Every member of the society is a consumer but only some are producers - 
            Adults from 16-64 or 20-64 year are producers while children less than 16 or 20 years and 
            the aged more than 65 years are the dependent population or burden of the adults. 
            46 
            Advantages of Dependency Ratio. - - - - 
            Comparison can easily be made between regions e.g between developing and developed 
            countries. 
            It can determine which regions are economically advanced or economically backward. 
            It can also help the government in her socio-economic planning policies. 
            The demographic characteristics of a country can also be known by calculating the 
            dependency ratio 
            Weaknesses of Dependency Ratio. 
             Dependency ratio may be crude or misleading because many people stay on at school even 
            after the youthful age group and into adult age. 
             In both developed and developing countries many people may still be working after 65 years. 
            This makes statistics for dependency questionable. 
             The proportion of unemployed adults who depend on other adults is to high in some 
            countries especially LEDCs.

            TOPIC: POPULATION CHANGE OVER TIME (POPULATION GROWTH) 
            Lesson 8: Historical Evolution of the World’s Population. 
            The study of the evolution of world population indicates very interesting trends and phases of 
            change over time. The world’s population growth was very slow or gradual before 1650. This 
            could be attributed to the epidemics, tribal wars, famine, poor medical facilities which caused 
            many deaths. In the absence of census at the time of Christ, the world’s population was estimated 
            at 300million and by 1650 it rose to about 500million people. Between 1650 and 1750 world 
            population started to increase at a faster rate than before. During this period, it was estimated at 
            47 
            791million. Between 1750 and 1850 world population noticed a more rapid and accelerated 
            growth as it doubled during this period. This increase could be attributed to the influence of the 
            economic and social changes such as the industrial and agrarian revolutions, improv3ment in 
            medical facilities and better sanitary conditions. At this time, it was the developed countries that 
            contributed to the global population growth. This is because the difference between births and 
            deaths were greater than those of the developing countries. 
            By 1850, world population stood at about 1,262 million. It doubled again by between 1850 and 
            1950 were it was about 2,515 million. The trend continued and just in about twenty-five years 
            (1980) it doubled again as it attained 4,500million. By this time up till date, the developing 
            countries were those contributing and are still contributing to this rapid population growth. By 
            the year 2000AD, world population stood about 6,130 million. Although the overall rate of 
            growth is slowing down the actual numbers per year are still increasing and by mid-1980s, the 
            estimated addition was 75millionper year but today it has risen to between 85 million and 
            96million each year and over 10,000 people are added to world population after every hour. It 
            was estimated that by 2010 world population would be about 7000million and by 2025 it may 
            stand at about 8300million (UN estimate). It should be noted that from the year 2010 to 2025 
            world population is only projected. The trend of increase in world population and projection are 
            shown on the following diagram. 
            48 
            A) Meaning: 
            Looking at the growth rate, the average annual growth rate of the world’s population of between 
            1.7% to 2% is fairly high, and it is not evenly distributed as there are marked variations between 
            economically developed and economically developing countries. The developed countries have 
            far lower growth rates that lie between 0.5% and 0.7% while the developing countries lie 
            between 1.9% - 2.5% which is considerably higher. Continentally, developing continents of 
            Asia, Latin America and Africa have far higher growth rates than Europe, North America, and 
            Australia. Africa being the highest (2.36%) and Europe the lowest. As a result of this disparities 
            in the rates of growth in the year 2000, it was observed that out of the about 6 billion people on 
            earth, the MEDCs accommodated only 1 billion whereas up to 5 billion resided in the LEDCs. 
            Lesson 9: Population Growth. 
            Population change (growth) is the indicator of the trend or direction which the population of a 
            region, continent or even the world is taking. It is simplest terms it can be referred to as the 
            increase in the population or number of people in an area. This can either be positive i.e. when it 
            is neither increasing nor negative when it drops. It can as well be zero population growth which 
            is achieved when birth rates and death rates are roughly equal and the average number of 
            49 
            
            
            50 
            
            children per family is about 2.3. Zero population growth is however difficult to attain 
            everywhere especially in Africa where there is still high birth rates hence jeopardizing the 
            chances of achieving zero population growth. It is however possible to attain this in the 
            developed countries given that birth and death rates are very low and roughly equal. These are 
            countries that have attained the fourth stage of the DTM. 
            Generally, birth rates in developing countries are very high, being up to 40 per thousand and 
            above with high fertility rates of over 120 per thousand. These are countries in Asia (excluding 
            Japan and China), Latin America (excluding Argentina and Cuba) and Africa. The highest birth 
            rate in 1997 were recorded in Africa south of the Sahara (Sub Sahara Africa) and some Middle 
            East countries with rates of over 50 per thousand. High birth and fertility rates are characteristics 
            of underdevelopment. 
            On the other hand, developed countries experience low fertility with birth rates of less than 
            20 per thousand e.g. Europe, USA, Australia, New Zealand and former U.S.S.R (CIS). Low birth 
            and fertility rates are thus characteristics of development. The world pattern of fertility is 
            therefore strongly bimodal with the bulk of the world’s population experiencing high fertility and 
            the other low. 
            B) The Population Change System. 
            The dynamism of population and the nature of change in terms of births, deaths numbers, 
            distribution, structure, and migration over time and space makes it to be considered as an open 
            system referred to as the population change system. This is because it has inputs, processes and 
            outputs. This is illustrated on the diagram below.

            Deaths  
            Emigration  
            Emigrants  
            The inputs into the system are those components which contribute to population increase. They 
            include births and immigrants (in-migrants). The more the number of births and influx of people 
            into an area/country each year and the greater the inputs and vice versa. With other determinants 
            held constant, the population would increase giving rise to a positive population change. 
            The processes are Natural increase or change and Net migration. Natural increase is the 
            difference between births and deaths (B-D). this operates when the difference between Birth and 
            Death is positive, but when the difference is negative, it is termed natural decrease. On the other 
            hand, Net migration is the difference between immigrants and emigrants (I-E) which may be 
            positive or negative. A positive net migration balance indicates that the number of immigrants is 
            more than the number of emigrants and in this case, the growth rate of the immigrant country 
            increase leading to an increase in the population of that country. For example the case of USA, 
            Australia and New Zealand. On the other hand, a negative net migration balance indicates that 
            51 
            the number of emigrants is more than that of immigrants. This would lead to a decrease in the 
            growth rate and population of the departure country. Most countries suffering from wars, famine, 
            experience this situation. 
            Outputs. 
            The outputs from the system constitute those components which help to bring about population 
            decrease. These include deaths and emigrants (out-migrants). When these numbers are high, the 
            greater would be the loss from the system and other determinants held constant, the population 
            would decline. This gives a negative population change. 
            The input, outputs and processes therefore operate to produce the total population which may be 
            high, low or stable. When inputs and outputs of the population system are in state of balance, the 
            population system would be in a state of equilibrium. In this state, the total population would 
            remain stable i.e. neither increasing nor decreasing and the change is not significant as the rate of 
            growth is very slow. This is common in countries which have attained the fourth stage of the 
            DTM whose population have an almost “Zero growth rate” with migrations highly regulated by 
            law and birth rates maintained at a replacement rate. 
            C) Determinants of Population Growth. 
            1. Fertility (Birth Rates) 
            It is the occurrence of live births. In other words, it is the level of childbearing in an individual 
            but more often in a society or nation. It should not be confused with fecundity which is the 
            reproductive capacity of an individual or the ability to have children. This is one of the major 
            inputs into the population system and contributes much to the global population growth. 
            Generally, birth rates in developing countries are very high, being up to 40 per thousand and 
            above with high fertility rates of over 120 per thousand. These are countries in Asia (excluding 
            Japan and China), Latin America (excluding Argentina and Cuba) and Africa. The highest rates 
            in 1997 were recorded in Africa south of the Sahara (Sub Sahara Africa) and some Middle East 
            countries with rates of over 50 per thousand. Thus high birth and fertility rates are characteristics 
            of underdevelopment. 
            52 
            On the other hand, developed countries experience low fertility with birth rates of less than 20 
            per thousand. Thus low birth and fertility are characteristics of development. The world pattern 
            of fertility is therefore strongly bimodal with the bulk of the world’s population experiencing 
            high fertility and the other low. Fertility is therefore one of the best socio-economic criteria for 
            distinguishing between developed and underdeveloped countries. 
            Indices of Fertility 
            These are the various methods used to ascertain or measure the fertility rate. They include: 
            a. Crude Birth Rate: This is the ratio of the number of live births in a period of time usually 
            one year to the total population expressed per thousand. This rate is very important because it 
            it demonstrates gross additions to the population through births and can also give a rough 
            idea of fertility trends in a particular country. It is calculated thus: 
            �

            𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
            ×1000
            1
            b. Fertility Ratio or Child-Woman Ratio: This shows the number of children under 5 years in 
            a population per 1000 women of the reproductive age (generally given as being between 15 
            to 45 or 49). Its main advantage is that it is a standardized rate and its limitation is that it 
            cannot be calculated annually but only for the five years preceding a census. It is calculated 
            as follows: 
            �
            �𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑛 𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 5

            ×100 𝑜𝑟 1000
            1
            c. General Fertility Rate: This is the ratio of the total number of registered births in a year 
            expressed per thousand women of normal reproduction or child bearing age (15-49years). It 
            is calculated as follows: 
            �

            ×1000
            1
            d. Cohort (Age-Specific) Fertility Rate: This is the number of births to mothers or fathers 
            grouped according to their year of birth. The calculations, may take into consideration 
            legitimate or illegitimate births or both. This can be expressed as follows: 
            �
            �𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑠 𝑡𝑜 𝑚𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑠 (𝑜𝑟 𝑓𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑠)𝑜𝑓 𝑎 𝑔𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛 𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑋

            54 
            
            e. Total Fertility Rate (TFR): This is the average number of children a woman is expected to 
            have during her lifetime. World average rate is estimated at about 3.1. The TFR is one of the 
            best indicators of future population growth. Its main advantage is that it takes into account 
            the female age-structure. 
            f. Replacement Rate: This is the level of birth (number of children born) in a year just 
            sufficient to balance the number of deaths in the same year. The global rate in the year 2000 
            stood at 2.1%. This is common in societies with zero population growth. 
            g. Reproduction rate: This is the average number of female babies born per one thousand 
            women during their reproductive period. This figure is not influenced by the age composition 
            of the population. 
            2. Mortality (Death Rate) 
            This is the occurrence of death. It is different from fertility in that it is more stable and 
            predictable and so it is less prone to rampant fluctuations as in fertility especially in the short 
            term. Death control is equally more acceptable than birth control and thus the rate of decline of 
            death is faster than that of fertility. Deaths occur at any age in ones life while fertility is more age 
            specific. Mortality is equally individual, inevitable and involuntary as opposed to fertility. 
            Looking at the trends of mortality, the rates though declining in developing countries, they 
            are still higher in some areas (especially in Africa) than the world’s average and even within the 
            developing world, there exist a disparity between the countries. For example, in 1970, average 
            mortality rate in Latin America was 21 per 1000, Asia 17 per 1000 and Africa between 25 and 30 
            per 1000. These rates however keep declining as the years go by. The increase in mortality in 
            most developing countries is attributed to inadequate medical facilities and few medical 
            personnel relative to the population, insufficient of clean water and food, poor hygiene and 
            sanitation, poverty, contagious diseases and increasing conflicts. However, the decline in death 
            or mortality rate in these areas may be attributed to the improvements in medical facilities, 
            importation of medical technology, better hygiene and sanitation, rising living standards , etc. 
            On the other hand, mortality rates in the developed countries are quite low, ranging between 
            8 to 10 per 1000. This low mortality can be attributed to advanced and sophisticated medical 
            technology, good hygiene and sanitation, etc. The decline in death rate has led to a sharp increase 
            in life expectancy which is about 75 years. 
            
            
            Factors influencing mortality (Death rates) 
            1. Demographic (age and sex): If the population of a country is made up of high proportion of 
            old, death rate will be higher as opposed to regions where the population is dominated by 
            adults. Also in regions where there is an excess of males over females, death rate will be 
            higher than in regions where there is a higher number of females over males. This is because 
            male mortality at all ages is higher than those of females. 
            2. Medical facilities and supply of medicines: In areas with better medical services and 
            enough supplies of drugs like in the developed countries, death rates will be lower than in 
            areas where these facilities are poor e.g developing countries. 
            3. Social class/security: Mortality is higher in the poorer sections of the population than the 
            richer sections. This is because they are unable to afford medical treatment, balanced diet, 
            better housing and sanitary conditions etc. 
            4. Level of economic development: there is a link between death rate and the level of 
            economic development. Regions with low death rates between 5%o and 8%o are 
            economically developed and enjoying high standards of living. This is because of available 
            medical care, better diets and sanitary conditions. On the other hand, high mortality rates of 
            between 20%o and 30%o are associated with economically backward areas experiencing low 
            living standards. This is because of the inability to afford medical care, poor diet, etc. 
            5. Occupations: Generally any occupation like mining, quarrying, building and construction, 
            administration, research (due to mental strain) which is strenuous and involves a lot of harsh 
            conditions often leads to relatively high death rates. 
            6. Place of residence: In the developed world, death rates are higher in urban than in rural 
            areas. This is because rural areas are healthier than urban areas. Urban areas also suffer from 
            crowded living conditions, high traffic densities, atmospheric pollution etc. On the other 
            hand, in most developing regions, mortality is lower I urban areas than in rural areas. This is 
            because of improvements in urban living conditions and the concentration of good medical 
            facilities in towns. 
            7. Environmental catastrophes: They include earth quake, tsunami, drought, flood, etc. 
            Indices of Mortality. 
            a. Crude Death Rate (CDR): This is the ratio between the number of deaths in a single year 
            and the total population expressed per 1000. It is called crude because it does not give any 
            55 
            indication of the causes of death. That is whether they are dying from diseases, starvation or 
            as a result of wars. It also does not indicate the age at which people are dying. Thus they are 
            only satisfactory when used in the comparison of population groups with identical 
            compositions. It is the most commonly used measure of mortality. It may be calculated thus:

            ×1000
            1
            b. Infant Mortality Rate: This is simply the number of deaths of infants below one year old 
            per thousand live births in a given period. It is far higher in developing countries than in the 
            developed ones. The lower the rate, the fewer the infant deaths and vice versa. It is calculated 
            as follows. 
            �
            �𝑜.𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑏𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑠 𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑜𝑙𝑑 𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟

            1
            c. Age-Specific Death Rates: This is simply the number of deaths of people of a certain age 
            group per 1000. For example infant mortality rate, adult or aged death rates. This provides a 
            more detailed analysis of the death rate situation of a region. When calculated, it facilitates 
            the construction of life tables of countries. It can be calculated thus: 
            �
            �𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑟 𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝 𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟

            ×1000
            1
            d. Standardized Mortality Rates (SMRs): This is the ratio of observed to expected deaths. 
            The expected deaths are derived from national figures while the observed deaths reflects the 
            real situation. This thus helps in comparison between national and locals trends. SMR of 100 
            indicates that the age-standardized mortality rate in the group being studied is the same as the 
            overall or standard population. But when it is less than 100, it shows a lower than average 
            death rate and over 100 shows a higher than average death rate. It can be calculated using the 
            formula: 
            �
            �𝑀𝑅 =𝑂𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠

            ×100
            1
            e. Maternal Mortality Rate: This is the number of women dying from causes arising from 
            deliveries and complications of pregnancy and childbirth per 10.000 live births. It is 
            generally far higher in developing countries than in developed countries. This is mainly due 
            to poor medical facilities and inadequate and poor pre-natal care. 
            56 
            
            
            57 
            
            f. Life Tables: It is summary of the likelihood of living from one age to any other. These are 
            tables showing the analysis of mortality by age and sex. They are usually compiled and 
            analyzed from census or vital registration data and their accuracy depends on the 
            effectiveness of these two sources of population statistics. It usually shows for each age 
            group, the number of deaths, the number of survivors and the expectancy of those living. E 
            The various life tables include; the life table mortality rate (i.e. it presents the probability of 
            dying during a given interval usually one year), the survival table (shows the number of 
            survivors at each age from birth), death tables (comprise the number of deaths at each age 
            and for both sexes), average life expectancy or life span, problem or median life (the duration 
            necessary to reduce the population to one-half). 
            3. Net Migration 
            When migration or immigration is more than out migration or emigration, a region will 
            experience high population growth but where the reverse situation takes place, then there 
            would be a slow population growth rate. Thus departure areas lose while receiving areas 
            gain. 
            Measures of Population Growth. 
            These are the various ways or methods used to ascertain or to calculate population growth. 
            They include: 
            1. Population Growth Rate: This measure the rate of increase or decrease of population 
            resulting from natural increase and net migration expressed as a percentage of the total 
            population. This measure is advantageous because it takes into consideration the effects of 
            natural increase and net migration. This commonly used measure is calculated thus:

            Where B =Births, D= Deaths, I = Immigration and E = Emigration. 
            2. Natural Increase or Decrease: Natural increase is the excess of births over deaths or the 
            positive difference between birth and deaths. In other words, it is the growth of a population 
            brought about as births exceeds deaths. 
            Natural decrease on the other hand is a situation where there is a negative difference between 
            births and deaths. It is calculated as follows: 
            �
            �𝐼 =𝐵−𝐷 
            3. Natural Increase and Decrease Rates: Natural increase rate is the positive difference 
            between the crude birth and deaths rates expressed per thousand of the total population while 
            the natural decrease rate is the negative difference between the two of them also expressed 
            per thousand of the total population. These two are less common and rarely occur. Calculated 
            thus:

            1
            Or Crude Birth Rate (CBR) – Crude Death Rate (CDR) 
            4. The Annual Rate of Increase: This is one of the most common and comprehensive 
            measures of population growth. This is because it takes into consideration both the effects of 
            natural increase and migration. This rate is advantageous because it is helpful in assessing 
            accuracy of vital and migration records. The following formula is used. 
            �

            Where Po is the population at the beginning of the period 
            P1= population at the end of the period and  
            t= the number of years. The two main components i.e. Po and P1 may be gotten from 
            census returns or population estimates.  
            5. The Population Equation (Balancing Equation) Method: This is the basic method or 
            measure used to calculate the numerical change of population over time. The future size of a 
            population depends on a range of functions, which are taken into consideration when doing 
            the calculation. The following formula is used. 
            �
            �2 =𝑃1+(𝐵−𝐷)+(𝐼−𝐸) 
            Where P2 =Population at a later date, 
            P1 =Population at the earlier date 
            B=Births 
            D=Deaths between the two periods 
            I=Immigration (in-migration) and 
            E=Emigration (out-migration) between the periods 
            B – D will be Natural Increase while 
            58 
            
            
            59 
            
                I – E would be Net migration which may be positive or negative. 
            6. Doubling Time: This is one of the earliest measures of population change. Doubling time 
            converts the annual growth rate percentage into a statistic that estimates the number of years 
            that will take the target population to double. (i.e. grow twice as its original size.). A simple 
            way of calculating doubling time is to apply the law of 70. In other words, any population 
            growing at a constant annual percentage can have its doubling growth rate into 70. It is 
            written thus: 
            �
            �𝑜𝑢𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒= 70
            𝐴𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡 
            For example: Given that the population growth rate is 2.8% per annum, and the population 
            stands at 15 million. Calculate the doubling time of the population. 
            �
            �.𝑇=70
            2.8=25𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠 
            PRACTICAL WORK 4: MEASUREMENTS OR CALCULATIONS OF 
            DEMOGRAPHIC INDICES - Fertility, fecundity, birth rate - Mortality - Growth rate - Population projections/doubling time - Net migration 
            Lesson 10: Factors of Population Growth. 
            These are the numerous socio-economic and natural factors that pass through fertility, mortality, 
            and net migration to influence the rate of population growth. They include: 
            1. Marriage: Marital behavior contributes to rapid or slow population growth in various 
            regions of the world. Countries with high percentage of married persons, early and 
            polygamous marriages, are very likely to have faster population growth through natural 
            increase than regions where the proportion is low. 
            2. Government Policy: Government through her influence on fertility may either encourage or 
            discourage population growth. In areas where government practice pro-birth that is, 
            encourages high birth rate (the case of Germany and Italy in the 1930s and most developing 
            countries today) would increase fertility and thus high birth rate. On the other hand, countries 
            which institute anti-natal policies (‘one child’ policy in china) aimed at reducing population 
            growth. 
            3. Improved medical services: Aspects of improvement here include opening of more 
            hospitals and health centres, child care units, availability of drugs and vaccines, increase 
            doctor/patient ratio, etc play a dual role in affecting population growth. This is seen in the 
            sense that this improvement I developing countries has contributed to increasing growth rate 
            because of better pre-natal care and reduced infant mortality. On the other hand, in the 
            developed world, this improvement has helped slow down the rate of population growth. 
            4. Environmental factors: These factors (famine, epidemics, natural disasters, etc) are known 
            to be very destructive and act negatively on population growth given that they reduce 
            population numbers through death as many people are often killed, encourage a lot of out 
            migration or emigration. 
            5. Wars: These adversely affect population growth as they cause mass deaths and out migration 
            of people contributing or slowing down population growth because during war time, the rate 
            of reproduction is almost zero (baby dust) as the adult group which is the most biologically 
            reproductive age group is involved and many of them die in the course of the war. For 
            instance the First and Second World Wars, Rwandan Civil war, Sudan, Liberia, etc all led to 
            the loss of millions of lives (mostly adults). 
            Lesson 11: Modern Demographic Explosions 
            Demographic explosion or demographic revolution refers to the sharp increase in the number of 
            people that have been or are being liberated from colonial dependence, has become one of the 
            most important worldwide problems in socioeconomic development in recent decades. 
            A) Causes of modern demographic explosion. 
            1. Agricultural advancements: This advancement especially in the 20th century has allowed 
            humans to increase food production using fertilizers, pesticides allowing humans with more 
            access to food that leads to subsequent population explosions. 
            2. Better medical facilities: Science was able to produce better means of producing food, 
            which allowed families to feed more mouths. Medical science equally made many 
            60 
            discoveries thanks to which they were able to defeat a whole range of diseases that had 
            claimed thousands of lives until now were cured because of the invention of vaccines. 
            3. Technological advancement in fertility treatment: With the latest technological 
            advancements and more discoveries in medical science, it has become possible for couples 
            who are unable to conceive to undergo fertility treatment methods and have their own babies. 
            Today there are effective medicines that increase the chance of conception thus increasing 
            global population. 
            4. Immigration: Many people prefer to move to developed countries like USA, Canada, where 
            the best facilities are available in terms of medical, education, security and employment. The 
            result is that those people settle over there, eventually making those places overcrowded. 
            5. Lack of family planning: This is mostly common in most developing countries as they have 
            a large number of people who are illiterate, live below poverty line and have little or no 
            knowledge about family planning. They also give out children for marriage at very early age 
            since they are unable to understand the harmful effects of overpopulation and lack of quality 
            education prompts them to avoid family planning measures. 
            6. Poor contraceptives use: Coupled with poor family planning on the part of partners can lead 
            to unexpected pregnancies though contraceptives are easily available for use thereby 
            increasing global population. 
            B) Consequences  
            a. Depletion of natural resources: The earth can only produce a limited amount of water and 
            food, which is falling short of the current needs. Thus, acts of violence and aggression like 
            cutting down forests, hunting wildlife recklessly, pollution, etc. outside of a war zone have 
            increased while competing for resources. 
            b. Degradation of the environment: With the overuse of coal, oil and natural gas, it has started 
            producing some serious effects on our environment coupled with the exponential rise in the 
            use of vehicles and industries. All these has badly affected the quality of air as it increases 
            CO2 emissions leading to global warming, melting of polar ice, changing climate patterns, 
            rise in sea levels, etc. 
            c. Conflicts and wars: Conflicts over water and other resources are becoming a source of 
            tension between countries, which could result in wars. These equally cause more diseases to 
            spread making them harder to control. All of these will only become worse if solutions are 
            not sought out for the factors affecting our population. 
            61 
            d. Rise in unemployment: When a country becomes overpopulated, it gives rise to 
            unemployment as there are fewer jobs to support a larger number of people. This rise in 
            unemployment gives rise to crime such as theft, as people want to feed their families and 
            provide them basic amenities of life. 
            e. High cost of living: As the difference between demand and supply continues to expand due 
            to overpopulation, it raises the prices of various essential commodities including food, shelter 
            and healthcare. This indicates people have to pay more to survive and feed their families. 
            f. 
            Pandemics and epidemics: Poverty is linked to many environmental and social reasons such 
            as overcrowding and unhygienic living conditions, malnutrition and inaccessible, inadequate 
            or non-existent healthcare, for which the poor are more likely to be exposed to infectious 
            diseases. High densities increase the chance of the emergence of new pandemics and 
            epidemics. 
            g. Malnutrition, starvation and famine:  When the availability of resources is scarce, 
            starvation, malnutrition, along with ill health and diseases caused by diet-deficiency such as 
            rickets become more likely. 
            h. Lower life expectancy: Low life expectancy is mostly experienced in less developed regions 
            as a result of the booms in population. This cause a shortage of resources resulting in less 
            access to medical care, freshwater, food and jobs and ultimately in a sharp fall in life 
            expectancy. 
            C) Managing Population Growth 
            i. 
            Pro-natal policies: These are policies which are designed with the purpose of increasing the 
            birth rate/fertility rate of an area/country. They are found in countries with either very slow 
            natural increase or natural decrease and in areas with ageing population. This is usually 
            carried out by giving out incentives such as money or material goods to families if they have 
            below or above a certain number of children. 
            Singapore is one of the countries that have championed this policy. In 1988, Singapore 
            pushed a campaign offering 12 weeks maternity leave for mothers of 4+ children, posters and 
            slogans “have 3 or more”, and offered larger and larger child benefits for each child a family 
            had. This was due to a fall in birth rate due to men and women deciding not to have families, 
            and pursue a career instead. 
            iii. Anti-natal policies: An anti-natal policy is a population policy which aims to discourage 
            births. This can be done through education on family planning and increased access to 
            62 
            
            
            63 
            
            contraception, or by law. An example of an anti-natal policy, which encourages families to 
            have fewer children, is the famous “one child policy” in china introduced in 1978 – 1980. 
            This policy was encouraged rather forcefully by the Chinese government, forcing women to 
            have abortions if they already had a child as well heavy fine of about £3,000 while for those 
            who respected the policy benefited from free education, housing priority and family benefits. 
            In certain instances, two babies were permitted if; both parents lived in the rural areas or 
            were from one-child household, if the first child was a female or died in the Sichuon 
            earthquake in 2018, etc. 
            The policy recorded a remarkable impact as fertility rate dropped from 5.7 in 1960 to 1.5 in 
            2011, about 400 million births may have been prevented. It also led to an ageing population 
            with increase dependency ratio, etc. 
            Lesson 12: Models of Population Growth; The Demographic Transition Model (DTM) 
            A) Meaning: Demographic transition is the distinct various stages in demographic growth 
            through which a population passes. The DTM describes a sequence of changes over a period 
            of time in the relationship between birth rates and death rates and overall population change. 
            These changes are held to occur as a nation progresses from a rural, agrarian and illiterate 
            state to a predominantly urban, industrial and literate one. This model was developed by F.W 
            Notestein and W.S Thompson in 1945 and was based on demographic studies in Northern 
            America and Western Europe. Four stages are clearly distinguished by Notestein but 
            convincing evidences shows that a fifth stage exists.  
            B) Stages (Demographic and Socioeconomic characteristics) 
            Stage 1: High Stationary or Primitive Regime or Phase 
            a. Demographic characteristics: At this stage marking the beginning of the cycle, both birth 
            and death rates are high and subject t6o short term fluctuations. Both rage between 30 and 40 
            per 1000. Infant mortality is very high as about 200 per 1000 children die before reaching the 
            age of 15 years. Population growth is very slow and fluctuates. Life expectancy here is very 
            low being about 35 years. The age-sex pyramid of such regions experiencing this stage 
            would be expansive with a broad base and very narrow apex. 
            b. Socio-economic characteristics - High rate of illiteracy as a result of grossly inadequate educational facilities - Poorly developed social amenities like pipe borne water, electricity, etc. 
            - - - - - 
            Low per capita income 
            Low standards of living 
            A purely subsistence agricultural society with backward methods of production. 
            Non-exploitation of potential resources 
            It is a stage of zero industrial development and very poor transport facilities. 
            Generally, the social, economic and political characteristics of this stage correspond to those 
            of the traditional society according to W.W Rostow in his stages of economic growth. 
            However, this stage rarely exist today but some evidence show that some underdeveloped or 
            uncivilized parts of tropical Africa, rainforest tribes in the Amazon and S.E Asia still 
            experience some of these characteristics. 
            Stage 2: Early Expanding Regime (Phase) - - - - 
            a. Demographic characteristics: At this stage, birth rate (fertility) remain high (about 35 per 
            1000) but death rates (mortality) fall rapidly to about 20 per 1000. Infant mortality is also 
            lower due to improved medical facilities and other factors although still high when compared 
            to other stages. This leads to high natural increase and rapid population growth. Life 
            expectancy at this stage also increases between 45 to 50 years which is still low compared to 
            other stages. Dependency ratio is high for countries at this stage and the age-sex pyramid 
            depicts the expansive type with a youthful population having a broad base and narrows 
            gradually towards the apex. 
            b. Socio-economic characteristics - 
            Development of educational facilities, although still inadequate but the literacy level is 
            higher than in the first stage 
            Improvement in health facilities which results in lower death rates. 
            Provision of other amenities like pipe borne water, electricity, etc 
            Per capita income is a bit higher than in the first stage 
            Investment rates generally increases from 5% to 10% of the National Income - - 
            Agriculture has been greatly revolutionized with the introduction of modern methods of 
            production 
            The secondary sector is introduced with the development of some major manufacturing 
            industries although capital is mostly from outside the region (foreign investments) 
            64 
            - 
            Improvements in living standards. 
            NB: These socio-economic and political characteristics are similar to those of the pre
            conditions for take-off and take off itself according to W.W Rostow’s stages of economic 
            growth model. Most African, Asian and Latin American countries are found at this stage. 
            The U.K and other western European countries exhibited these characteristics between 1750 
            and 1870 i.e. at the beginning of the industrial revolution. 
            Stage 3: Late Expanding Regime/Phase 
            a. Demographic characteristics: At this stage birth rates start falling rapidly (between 20 and 
            25 per 1000) due to birth control methods, low infant mortality, rise in status of women, etc 
            while death rates continue to fall slightly (about 10 to 15 per 1000) due to improved medical 
            facilities, good diets, clean housing and better housing, etc. Infant mortality is low. These 
            give rise to a slowly increasing population. Life expectancy is higher between 55 and 65 
            years. Dependency ratio is reduced. The age-sex pyramid begins to contract at the base and 
            widens at the apex. This thus shows an intermediate age-sex pyramid. 
            b. Socio-economic characteristics - - - - - - - - 
            Rise in per capita income 
            Great expansion in trade 
            Agriculture is highly mechanized resulting in high output 
            Increase in investment rate 
            Great improvements in the provisions of social amenities 
            Medical services and facilities continue to improve 
            Higher literacy level compared to stage two. 
            Steady consolidation of the new industrialized society. 
            NB: This socio-economic characteristics are similar to those of the drive towards maturity 
            according to W.W Rostow’s model of economic growth model and examples of countries at 
            this stage today include; China, Cuba, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Portugal, New 
            Zealand, etc. 
            Stage 4: Low Stationary or Fluctuating or Mature Regime 
            a. Demographic characteristics: At this stage, both birth rate and death rate remain low and 
            fluctuating slightly. Birth rate is between 10 and 15 per 1000 due to high life expectancy, 
            high literacy level, later and monogamous marriages, etc while death rate is between 8 and 
            12 per 1000 due to great improvement in medical facilities, good diets, housing, sanitary 
            65 
            conditions, etc. In few instances like the case of Germany and Sweden, death rate may rise 
            above death rate leading to a natural population decline. This is mainly because of ageing. 
            Life expectancy at this stage is very high above 75 years and dependency ratio increases. The 
            age-sex pyramid is the regressive or constrictive type with a wide apex showing an 
            increasing number of old people and a narrow base showing a decreasing number of children. 
            b. Socio-economic characteristics. - - - - - - - 
            High literacy level 
            Development of a good social security system to cater for the aged 
            Highly developed medical facilities with a lot of specialized equipment and personnel 
            Industrial development is at its peak and geared towards the production of durables. 
            Per capita income is very high leading to high living standards 
            There is rapid growth of quaternary occupations, increase materialism and the location of 
            resources to social welfare. 
            Transport development reaches its zenith with high level of connectivity. 
            NB: The socio-economic and political characteristics of this stage are similar to those of the 
            stages of high mass consumption which is the last stage in the economic growth model 
            according to W.W Rostow. Examples of countries at this stage include: Germany, UK, 
            Canada, USA, Norway and many economically developed countries. They are considered 
            demographically advanced. 
            Stage 5: Low and Declining Regime/Phase 
            This occurs when birth rate falls or is lower than death rate. Here, birth rate ranges between 8 
            and 10 per 1000 while death rate between 10 and 12 per 1000. This gives rise to a declining 
            population as population growth becomes negative. This is a characteristic of economically 
            and demographically developed countries like Sweden, Germany, and Japan. Life expectancy 
            here is very high with a high dependency ratio given that the number of old people keeps 
            increasing. The reason for high death here is purely demographic i.e. due to the ageing of the 
            population. On the non-demographic point of view, population decline may be experienced 
            during wars, famine, natural disasters, etc. the socio-economic characteristics of this stage 
            corresponds to W.W Rostow’s high mass consumption stage in his economic growth model. 
            66 
            C) Application of the Model to Cameroon. 
            a. Demographic characteristics - - - - - 
            The DTM in Cameroon shows an evolution in terms of birth and death rates in Cameroon 
            indicating that Cameron has passed through stage one of the DTM but has not attained stage 
            four. Demographic, socio-economic and political evidence show that Cameroon is largely in 
            the second stage and has evolved into the early part of stage three. 
            Birth rate is still high. In 1976, the crude birth rate was 45 per 1000, then in 1997 it dropped 
            slightly to 41 per 1000. 
            Mortality or death rate is rapidly declining. For instance mortality rate between 1960 and 
            1965 was 23.4 per 1000 and dropped to 10.7 per 1000 between 1995 and the year 2000. 
            Infant mortality is still high though declining.  
            There is high natural increase leading to high population growth. 
            There has been a slight increase in life expectancy. 
            b. Socio-economic characteristics. - - - 
            Higher literacy level as a result of the provision of educational facilities 
            Improvements in medical facilities, evidenced by the establishment of health units, 
            vaccination and inoculation campaigns, training of more doctors, etc. 
            Improvement in hygiene and sanitation 
            67 
            - - - - - 
            Provision of amenities like pipe borne water supply, electricity, etc. 
            Improvement in the level of economic development as investment levels have increased to 
            about 5%. 
            Agriculture has been revolutionized  
            Gradual increase in per capita income and living standards 
            Improvement in transport and trade expansion. 
            NB: The socio-economic and political characteristics are similar to those of stage 2 of W.W 
            Rostow’s economic growth model that is the pre-conditions for take-off stage. 
            D) Appraisal of the Model 
            Importance of the DTM 
             It provides a useful basis for further study of demographic changes. 
             It is used to show the population growth of a country changes over a period of time. 
             It may be used to compare rates of growth between different countries at a given point in 
            time. 
             It assists in government socio-economic planning policies. 
            Weaknesses or criticisms of the DTM 
            Despite its applicability, this model has its limitations. They include 
             It is drawn purely from the North American and European experience and it is very unlikely 
            that the developing countries would follow an identical growth model as they would certainly 
            undergo different population growth patterns because of their different racial, cultural and 
            historical backgrounds. 
             .in some developed countries like Sweden, Japan and Germany, birth rates have fallen below 
            death rates resulting to population decline indicating that the original model which shows 
            four stages may no longer hold today as demographic changes continuously occur. Indicating 
            a fifth stage. 
             The model did not take into consideration the negative effects of natural disasters and war on 
            the pattern of population growth. They would obviously distort the sequence of population 
            growth. 
             The time scale of the model especially in many S.E Asian countries like Hong Kong, 
            Malaysia, etc. is not being respected as they develop at a much faster rate than did the early 
            industrialized countries. 
            68 
             The population policies of countries differ and therefore their demographic growth would not 
            follow the same pattern. 
             The DTM does not take into account migration, which is a major component of population 
            change. 
             Differences in socio-economic and cultural behaviors and government attitude towards 
            population change in some countries have made it impossible to follow strictly the stages 
            predicted. 
             The model neglects the influence of cultural differences like early marriages and large family 
            sizes. 
             The fall in birth rate in stage 3 has been very slow in some countries than the model suggests 
            because of different religious or political opposition to birth control. 
             The model assumes that all countries would experience a fall in the death rate during stage 2 
            as a result of industrialization but this has not been the case, as many developing countries 
            never became industrialized. 
            TOPIC: POPULATION CHANGE OVER SPACE (MIGRATION) 
            Lesson 13: Migration 
            A) Meaning 
            Migration has been going on for thousands of years and the present distribution of man over 
            the earth surface owes much to it. In it simplest terms, migration can be referred to “a permanent 
            or semi-permanent change of residence with a complete re-adjustment of the community 
            affiliations of the migrant”. It can also be referred to “the movement or displacement of people 
            from one geographical area to another at a particular time”. This movement of people from place 
            to place can be viewed as a spontaneous human effort to achieve a balance between population 
            and resources. It is worth mentioning here that migration is a natural phenomenon which 
            produces demographic, social and economic interactions that together reduces some irregularities 
            of nature. 
            There are however some difficulties in an attempt to establish a clear and concise definition 
            of migration. As such, a classification has been made which applies in the domains of; origins 
            and destinations of migrants, distance, duration, motives, volumes and causes underlying it. Such 
            69 
            classifications are necessary to put the individual into context, given that population movements 
            can be so diversified, to see how it relates to or compares with other movements. 
            B) Characteristics or Differentials of Migration. 
            Migration is selective and differential migration simply means the tendency for certain elements 
            of the population to be more migratory than others. In other words, it is based on the concept that 
            some people and some groups are likely to migrate than others. These differentials or selectivity 
            occurs as follows; 
             Age selective: In both internal and external migration flows, late adolescents and young 
            adults usually predominate. They move more than the young and old people and are often 
            migrating to their first job and for education or merely for adventure. They adjust themselves 
            to their new environments than do the other age groups. 
             Sex Selective: This aspect needs critical examination because either males or females may in 
            certain economic circumstances be more migratory. Generally, in developed countries, short 
            distance internal migrants are mostly females while over long distances males predominates. 
            On the other hand, in many developing countries, male migration predominates in both 
            internal and international migration. But with the improvement in transport facilities, 
            mobility has increased for box sexes today making it almost equal for both sexes especially 
            for internal migration. 
             Marital Status: Generally, single people migrate more than the married. This is because of 
            the constraints involved in moving families. In most developed countries however, there is 
            more and more migration of families. This is because of their small family sizes as opposed 
            to the large family sizes in developing countries. 
             Occupation: Migration is common among certain occupational groups than others. 
            Professional classes are more migratory than either semi-skilled or unskilled workers. Also 
            unemployed persons tend to be more migratory than employed persons. 
             Education Level: Those who have spent a longer period of time in education (school) or 
            those with higher literacy level migrate more than illiterates or the less educated. 
             Ethnic Group: Some ethnic groups are more migratory than others e.g. The Fulani are more 
            migratory than the Bantus. 
             Socio-economic groups: Generally the rich migrate more than the poor given that the rate of 
            migration is a function of money (ability to bear the cost of movement). 
            70 
             Races and Nationality: Whites migrates more than Blacks. 
            C) Laws and Theories of Migration 
            i) The Inverse Distance Law Theory by G.K. ZIPF. 
            He expanded on the first law of migration by Ravenstein (which states that the majority of 
            migrants travel short distances and their numbers decreases as distance increases). Thus the 
            inverse distance law states that “the volume of migration is inversely proportional to the 
            distance travelled by the migrants”. This is expressed mathematically as follows: 
            �
            �𝑖𝑗 ∝ 1
            𝐷𝑖𝑗
            Where Nij= the number of migrants from town i to town j and 
            Dij= is the distance between the two towns. 
            This inverse relationship means that a greater number of migrants move over short distances 
            and decrease as the distance increases. The distance decay concept therefore applies in this 
            model. The inverse distance law is illustrated on the following diagram. 
            A 
            4km 
            C 
            B 
            Figure: The inverse distance law. 
            The diagram shows three locations A, B and C at different distances. When the formula is 
            applied, the number of migrants between these places can be known. E.g. the number of 
            migrants from town A to town B (Nij) will be represented by 1/10 or 0.1 given that Dij is 0.2. 
            71 
            - - - - - - - 
            it shows that more people travel between A and C (0.25 shortest distance), followed by B and 
            C, and the least number is between A and B i.e. 0.1 (longest distance). This illustrates the 
            inverse relationship wherein as distances between places increase migration flow is smaller. 
            Conversely, the number of people increases over shorter distances. 
            Reasons for the above inverse relationship 
            Long distances are more costly and thus few people can afford transport cost while shorter 
            distances are cheaper and so more migrants can afford. 
            There is limited information about long distance places. 
            Family and friendship ties and heavy family responsibilities reduces long range movers. 
            Higher risk and hardship are involved in travelling over long distances than shorter ones. 
            Short distances do not involve a lot of documentation, as it is the case with long distances. 
            Communication and language difficulties discourage long distance movements. 
            Intervening obstacles like poor relief, harsh climate, and employment opportunities limit the 
            number of people moving over long distances. 
            ii) The Gravity Model 
            This is a model of interaction between two population centres based on Newton’s Law of 
            Universal Gravitation. Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation states that “any two heavenly 
            bodies attract one another with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses 
            and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them”. This is expressed using 
            the following formula. 
            �
            � =𝐺𝑀₁𝑀₂
            𝐷²
            Where F=the force of attraction 
            M₁ and M₂=the masses of the two bodies 
            D²=the distance apart squared 
            G=the Universal constant of nature. 
            From the formula, it can be deduced that: 
             As the distance (D) between the two bodies increases, the forces of attraction (F) relationship 
            between them decreases. This indicates an inverse or negative relationship. 
            72 
             If the masses (M₁ and M₂), increase, the force (F) between them increases as well. This 
            indicates a direct or positive relationship. 
            In population studies (notably migration) this model predicts the tendency for people to migrate 
            between two places. This model takes into consideration two important variables, that is, the 
            migrants and distance. It is a fundamental fact that most  migrations take place over relatively 
            shorter distances. This model is therefore based on the fact that migration is some function of 
            distance. It helps to explain the behavior of the migrant in relation to distance. This model is 
            expressed mathematically in the following formula:  
            �
            �𝑖𝑗 = 𝐾 𝑃𝑖𝑃𝑗
            (𝐷𝑖𝑗)²
            𝑜𝑟 𝑀𝑎𝑏 =𝐾 𝑃𝑎𝑃𝑏
            (𝐷𝑎𝑏)²
            Where Mij or Mab=the volume of migration between place i and j or a and b 
            Pi and Pj or Pa and Pb=populations of the two places j and i or a and b respectively 
            Dij2 or Dab2= Distance separating the two place i and j or a and b, squared. 
            K=constant of proportionality. 
            In the formula, the two towns i and j or a and b have replaced the two heavenly bodies, M1 M2 in 
            Newton’s Law. The populations Pi and Pj or Pa and Pb represent their masses and their 
            interactions Mij or Mab represent the force between them. The gravity model suggests two basic 
            relationships (principles). They are: 
            a. The size of the population at one or both towns: Here, the volume of migration is directly 
            proportional to the population size and product of the area or the destination. This implies 
            that the greater the population and population product (various attractions developed by the 
            population) and size of a town or city, the greater is its ability to attract migrants. Thus when 
            migration occurs over a certain distance, it tends to terminate in an urban area with large 
            population size and product. 
            b. The distance between the two towns: The volume of migration or interaction is inversely 
            proportional to the square of the distance separating the two regions. This simply means that 
            most migrants travel short distances and the number of migrants’ decreases as distance 
            increases. This notion summaries the first migration law of E.G Ravestein and the Inverse 
            Distance Law of G.K. Zipf (Distance decay concept). 
            Example 1: Using the3 formula above, calculate M for the region i with population 25,000 
            and region j with population of 50,000 with the two regions being 100km apart. 
            73 
            
            
            74 
            
            �
            �=25,000×50,000
            100² =1,250,000,000
            10,000 =125,000 𝑚𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑠 
            Example 2: Using the gravity model formula also, the spatial interaction between Bamenda 
            and the other towns can be calculated using the hypothetical information from the following 
            diagram. 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Bamenda is linked to four separate towns with different distances separating them and different 
            population sizes. If the gravity model formula is used without the K value, the following results 
            are obtained.  
            a. Bamenda and Bafoussam 
            =250,000×200,000

            6400 =2,734,375

            (50,000 people) 
            Bafoussam  
            (200,000 people) 
            250,000 ×50,000

            d. Bamenda and Fundong 
            =250,000× 65,000

            40,000
            =312,500 
            =16,250,000,000
            4900
            =3,316,326 
            From the values of predicted spatial interaction, it is observed that the movement of people 
            between Bamenda and Bafoussam and between Bamenda and Wum are different even though 
            they have the same distances from Bamenda. It’s therefore the difference in population size that 
            is significant here. It should however be noted that the results obtained above are unrealistic 
            (without using the multiplier or K-value) because the volume of spatial interaction is too large or 
            exaggerated. However, the formula can be modified in order to make the results more realistic 
            i.e. bring them closer to actual interactions. This can be done by scaling down, using the 
            multiplier or K-value constant. E.g if the modification made is a constant of 0.01, what will be 
            the actual volume of migration or interaction between i and j in example 1? 
            This would simply be 0.01 ´ 125,000 =1250 migrants. 
            In example 2, if the K value of 0.0001 is introduced to the formula, the resultant values of 
            predicted flows will be scaled down and brought closer to reality as follows: 
            a. 0.0001 ×7,812,500 = 781 
            b. 0.0001 ×2,734,375 = 273.5 
            c. 0.0001 ×312,500 = 31.25 
            d. 0.0001 ×3,16,326 = 331.6  
            Applicability of the Gravity Model - - 
            It is a useful way of examining the movement of people, goods, and ideas between two 
            places. 
            It integrates the frictional effects of distance, bringing out the fundamental fact that migration 
            or movement is a function of distance between two places which are complementary to each 
            other. - 
            It considers the influence of sizes of the population of both areas which is not considered in 
            other models. 
            75 
            Weaknesses of the Gravity Model - - - - - 
            It fails to consider the effects of intervening opportunities on the volume of migration 
            between two places but dwells only on population size and distance. 
            Although population size is important in determining movement, it is not the only 
            determinant or pull factor of migrational flows as indicated in the model. 
            In the case of distance, the model fails to consider the mode of transport and the difficulty of 
            movement (that is the nature of terrain). 
            The level of information available to migrants about the destination is inadequate. 
            The model does not consider or mention the contrast between regions (that is 
            complementarity). 
            iii) Intervening Opportunities Model by A.S. Stouffer 
            This model was postulated in 1940 by an American Psychologist by name A.S. Stouffer. The 
            model looks at the influence of opportunities found between the migrant’s area of origin and 
            destination on the volume of migration or spatial interaction. Opportunities are the pull or 
            seductive factors present at the destination that attract the population while intervening 
            opportunities are all the attractive or pull factors found between a migrant’s area of origin and 
            destination. In other words they are spatial sponges soaking up potential migrants between 
            complementary places. The model is expressed mathematically in the following formula. 
            �
            �𝑖𝑗 ∝ 𝑂𝑗
            𝑂𝑖𝑗
            Where Nij= Number of competing migrants between town i and j 
            Oj=The number of opportunities at j 
            Oij=The number of intervening opportunities between town i and j. 
            This model has two basic principles guiding it. They are: 
            a. That the volume of migration or the amount of interaction over a given distance is 
            directly proportional to the number of opportunities at the point of destination. This 
            implies that the more the opportunities at the destination, the greater the number of 
            migrants who move into it. 
            b. That the volume of migration or interaction is inversely proportional to the number of 
            opportunities between the point of departure and destination. This implies that the greater 
            the number of intervening opportunities between the two places, the smaller the volume 
            76 
            of migration and the fewer the number, the greater the volume of migration between the 
            two places. 
            Weaknesses of the model. - - 
            The model does not explain the causes of migration nor take into consideration other 
            significant variables affecting the volume of migration and interaction between competing 
            areas. 
            The mode of transport is not given. 
            Lesson 14: Notion of Spatial Interaction 
            A) Meaning 
            Spatial interaction refers to the movement of goods and services, people and ideas (information) 
            between specific areas and over certain distances in time and space. Some of the movements are 
            visible (tangible e.g people and goods) while others involves invisible (intangible e.g 
            information/ideas, etc). The rate of interaction varies from region to region depending on the 
            level of socio-economic development, literacy level of the population, the physical geography of 
            the regions and the distance separating them. 
            B) Factors Influencing the amount of Spatial interaction between regions 
            1. Complementarity: This simply means the degree to which two regions complement each 
            other. In order for two or more regions to interact there must be demand in one and a supply 
            in the other. That is, the demand for a good or service at one place must be matched by the 
            supply of that same good or service at another. (i.e supply must be backed by the ability to 
            pay for it). Complementary regions are linked by flows, which reflect the relative surpluses 
            and deficiencies of the regions and the greater the surpluses and deficiencies, the greater 
            would be the amount of interaction between them. It also involves farmers going to the farm 
            in the morning and returning in the evening, students going to school at the beginning of the 
            term and returning at the end of the term, etc. 
            2. Intervening Opportunities: For smooth interaction to take place between regions, there 
            must be the absence of intervening opportunities between the origin and destination. The 
            presence of these opportunities would reduce the amount of spatial interaction between 
            regions and so they should be absent. 
            3. Transferability: Interaction can only take place with products that are transferable even if 
            there are no intervening opportunities. For spatial interaction to take place, the products or 
            77 
            services must be mobile not just physically but economically. For example if a buyer at place 
            A pays for a product or service at place B and the product cannot be moved from B to A, 
            then interaction has not taken place. On the other hand, if the buyer at place A cannot afford 
            the product at place B, that product will be fixed to the spot. 
            Apart from these three factors advanced by Ullman, the volume of migration or interaction 
            between two regions depends on a number of factors. These include: 
            a. Cost of factor: Various types of costs may affect the amount of spatial interaction 
            between places. Such costs may include monetary cost, cost of energy, cost of 
            inconvenience, time cost, social cost, etc. Monetary cost is the most important here. For 
            example, the higher the cost of transport, the lesser the amount of interaction or migration 
            given that fewer people would be prepared to pay the high transport cost. 
            b. Distance: The amount of interaction varies with distance as the amount of spatial 
            interaction or volume of migration decreases with increasing distance between two 
            regions. Thus the amount of interaction is greater over short distances than over longer 
            distances. 
            c. Level of Information: The amount of spatial interaction is determined by the level of 
            information available between two regions that is knowledge of the destination by the 
            migrant. Hence the amount of interaction or migration is greater where migrants are well 
            informed and educated about the opportunities at the destination and would be lower 
            where migrants are less educated or informed. 
            d. Political Atmosphere: Spatial interaction between two countries/regions would be high 
            if the two regions are politically stable but when there is political instability in one or 
            both countries/regions, spatial interaction would be very low or non-existent. This also 
            applies with migration laws. 
            e. Nature of Physical Environment: Where there are physical obstacles like rugged or 
            hilly relief, swamps or floods, etc between two regions, especially in regions where there 
            is little or no development, the amount of interaction reduces. Conversely, where these 
            are absent or better developed, interaction would increase. 
            f. 
            Formation of Economic Unions: Where countries have organized and grouped 
            themselves in trading blocs (Economic unions) such as CEMAC, ECOWAS, EU, LAIA 
            the amount of spatial interaction between such regions will be greater than when such 
            unions do not exist. 
            78 
            g. Cultural Ties/Links: The degree of spatial interaction is greater between places with 
            some identical cultural aspects like language, education, ect than between regions with 
            contrasting aspects. 
            h. Population Size: The volume of migration or spatial interaction is directly proportional 
            to the population size. That is, the larger the population of the areas concerned, the 
            greater the volume of interaction and vice versa. 
            i. 
            Mode and Development of Transport: Physical distance separating areas is today not a 
            great influence on interaction due to improvement in technology. Thus areas with 
            efficient transport modes tend to have higher volumes of spatial interaction than those 
            where they are backward. 
            Lesson 15: Types or Forms of Migration. 
            The diversity of migration in terms of duration, direction, distance, volume and motive has made 
            the task of classifying migration difficult. Despite these shortcomings, perhaps the most 
            important and commonly used way for classifying migration is distance. This brings out two 
            distinct but broad types of migration (that is Internal and External or International). The various 
            types of movements fall under these broad types. This is seen below. 
            A) Voluntary versus Forced. 
            Voluntary movements occur when migrants move from choice. Here the decision to move is 
            taken by the migrant. Thus migration results from unforced motives because before the migrant 
            takes a decision to move voluntarily, he must have some good physical, economic, social and 
            political reasons which would improve on his quality of life or have greater freedom. 
            Forced/compulsory/ involuntary migration on the other hand occurs when people have virtually 
            no choice but to move from an area. It describes the expulsion of people from one place to 
            another and the decision to migrate is not taken by the migrant but by forced circumstances. 
            Much compulsory migration has resulted from either religious or political persecution, natural 
            disasters, wars or economic impositions. 
            B) Internal Migrations 
            These are concerned with the movement of people within a country or political unit. Here 
            therefore, migrants do not cross national boundaries. 
            Types of Internal Migrations 
            79 
            1. Rural-Urban Migration (Rural Exodus): It is simple the movement of people away from 
            the countryside (rural areas) to towns (urban areas) of a country. This movement is generally 
            the most important form of internal migration especially in countries experiencing 
            industrialization and technological progress. The intensity of rural exodus reached an 
            alarming proportion in the 20th century in the developing and is still very pronounced in these 
            areas nowadays due to the growth of transport media which has facilitated movement. 
            However, it has reached overwhelming proportions in both developed and developing 
            countries due to the growth of various modes of transport, which made displacement easy 
            and cheap. 
            Causes of Rural-Urban Migration 
            a. Push factors: These are factors which are present in the rural areas and trigger off or force 
            people out of them. They include: 
             Rural Population pressure: This exists when there are so many people settled on a small 
            land area resulting in overcrowding. It may be brought about by high natural increase or 
            rampant in migration as a result of fertile soils for agriculture leading to high population 
            densities. This often leads to scarcity of land for cultivation and settlement thus the ultimate 
            solution is out migration to town. E.g Parts of the western highlands (Bamileke rural areas) 
            of Cameroon, the Kano settled zone in Northern Nigeria, etc. 
             Mechanization of agriculture: This involves the use of machines in most of the farming 
            reduction in demand for agricultural labourers leading to a high rate of unemployment and 
            consequently triggers off rural exodus because the redundant labourers have no jobs and 
            hopes to find new jobs in towns. 
             Traditional land tenure system: In most developing countries land inheritance has led to 
            land fragmentation, making farm sizes very small as opposed to land consolidation in 
            developed countries. Sizes of individual farms are reduced such that they are operated only at 
            a subsistence level or below and make it difficult to support a family. Thus the end result is 
            out migration into towns. 
             Rural overpopulation: This is rampant in rural areas especially those of less developed 
            societies. Here population number exceeds resources resulting in low living standards. This 
            often results from rapid rural population growth, uneven distribution of agricultural land low 
            technology, etc. The effects are low incomes, low living standards, high rate of 
            80 
            unemployment, hunger, etc. As a result, there is usually rampant out migration from such 
            rural areas. 
             Absolute poverty: In some rural societies, people may stay for many months without money 
            to meet up with their basic needs. This may result partly from the high unemployment, the 
            dependence on purely subsistence agriculture where very little or nothing is sold. The need 
            for this therefore triggers off or forces people to move out to the towns where they hope to 
            fine jobs and make some money. 
             Food shortages: This may develop if the agricultural output is too low to support the 
            population of an area or if there is crop failure as a result of over cropping, blight, and 
            overgrazing, natural disasters. This often leads to widespread famine and thus triggers off a 
            lot of out migration from rural to urban areas. 
             Lack of or limited social amenities: Amenities like electricity, schools, hospitals, housing 
            facilities, pipe borne water etc. are lacking or very limited in most rural areas especially those 
            of the developing world and often trigger off waves of movement from rural to urban areas. 
             Repugnant traditions: Some rural areas in developing countries encourage traditions which 
            are extremely unpleasant e.g. forceful marriages, female circumcision, initiation into various 
            groups and witchcraft. This often forces people especially young adults out of the villages to 
            towns.  
            b. Pull Factors: These constitute the seductive amenities present in urban areas and lure people 
            from the rural areas. These factors are responsible for centripetal movements. They include: 
             Availability of Employment avenues (Opportunities): Urban areas offer more and better 
            employment opportunities than the rural areas. This is because economic growth has 
            occurred predominantly in urban areas leading to the creation of many job opportunities. 
            Thus as a result of the presence of these job opportunities, many rural dwellers are attracted 
            to move into these towns with the hope of picking up one. 
             High incomes and living standards: Generally, people in the urban areas have higher 
            incomes and a higher purchasing power than the rural population. This is mainly because 
            non-agricultural employments in urban areas are more paying than the purely agricultural 
            economies of rural areas. As a result of this, the living standards in urban areas are higher 
            therefore attracting many people from the rural areas. 
             Presence of seductive amenities: Towns offer many seductive amenities which canbe 
            grouped into two categories (public amenities e.g educational facilities, electricity, pipe 
            81 
            borne water, etc and entertainment spots e.g nightclubs, cinema shows, theatre, etc). these 
            amenities attract many people from the rural areas, especially those who have a taste for a 
            refined and easy life. 
             Wrong perception of urban areas: Generally the belief is that everything is wonderful in 
            urban areas especially when some friends or relatives return to the villages from town. This 
            perception attracts many people in the rural areas but when they migrate some may succeed 
            and others do not. 
             Improvement in transport:  Various modes of transport such as roads, railways, airports, 
            have been improved upon making movements attractive and easy. Transport development 
            has made known the opportunities present in urban areas and this has helped to increase the 
            number of new comers into towns. 
            Consequences (Effects) of Rural-Urban Migration 
            I. Economic Consequences 
            i. 
            Rural Areas (Source or Origin or Departure Areas) 
            a. Positive consequences: They include; 
             Relieve of the rural population pressure: Out migration to towns is a welcome relieve to 
            areas experiencing population pressure or overpopulation. When this happens, the land and 
            resources can therefore sustain the remaining population. 
             Correction of labour surpluses and reduction of rural unemployment: If rural exodus 
            takes place and some active adults are left behind, it is possible for a reorganization of the 
            community to take place on a sounder basis and with a higher standards of living. 
             Socio-economic development of rural areas: Financial support from urban areas promotes 
            socio-economic development in some rural areas. This is because those who migrate out are 
            able to work some money and then carry out investments like creating small and medium 
            size industries, contributing for projects like electricity, road, etc. 
             Broadening of Horizon of rural people: Migrants returning from the urban areas may help 
            spread new ideas, techniques and innovations that would contribute in the socio-economic 
            development of the rural environment and broadening of the knowledge of rural inhabitants. 
            b. Negative consequences. 
            82 
             Labour shortages: There will be labour shortages and fall in agricultural output because the 
            active population has migrated to towns due to various attractions in towns, leaving behind 
            the young and old with little or no strength. Thus a fall in agricultural productivity. 
             General Economic stagnation and idle resources: Out migration of people out of the rural 
            areas may also result in general economic stagnation and the unexploitation of resources in 
            affected rural areas. This is because little or no investments take place since there are acute 
            labour force shortages. 
            ii. 
            Urban Areas (Destination) 
            a. Positive consequences 
             Increased market potential: The high volume of in migrants helps to increase the market 
            potential in the urban areas. This is because the influx of people from the countryside 
            increases the population of the receiving areas. 
             Development of informal sector: The influx of rural dwellers into towns often encourages 
            the development of informal sector of the economy. This is employment that is not formally 
            recognized and the workers in this sector generally have no fixed hours, no employment 
            benefits and their activities are untaxed. 
             Supply of cheap labour: Urban areas have benefited from cheap man-power as a result of 
            the large numbers leaving the rural areas at little or no cost and which is ready to work at any 
            wage rate. This rural population is therefore an asset from which the dynamically expanding 
            urban areas have drawn much profit. 
            b. Negative consequences. 
             High rate of unemployment: Generally, the influx of migrants from rural areas often leads 
            to acute unemployment. This is because the employment opportunities are too few relative to 
            the invading migrants and most of them are unskilled. 
             Low living standards: As a result of the high rate of unemployment, standards of living are 
            very low with many people living below the poverty line and cannot afford most of their 
            needs. 
            II. Social Consequences 
            a. Rural Areas (Origin or Departure areas): The social consequences are largely negative. 
            They include; 
            83 
             There may be under-utilization of few social amenities available in some villages like health 
            facilities, entertainment spots, etc. This is because those strong members of the village 
            community who are supposed to utilize them have out migrated to towns 
             It may also lead to broken homes or separation of families and sexual immorality given that 
            the attractions in towns may keep one partner away from the other permanently. This 
            eventually increases the number of divorces. 
             The rampant out migration of mainly the youthful population may lead to a fall in school 
            enrolment figures and the closure of some schools in rural areas. 
             In some cases, the massive movement of people out of the rural areas leads to a drastic 
            reduction in the population and as a result of the scanty population, the government may not 
            provide social amenities like pipe borne water, electricity, health and education. 
            b. Urban Areas (Destination) 
            Negative Consequences: They include; 
            o Accommodation problems: The influx of migrants into towns/cities has caused grave 
            housing shortages and difficulties. Usually there are more people than the available houses 
            can accommodate. 
            o Congestion and overcrowding: The movement of rural dwellers into towns also leads to 
            congestion and overcrowding. This is noticed on streets (given the narrow and poorly 
            maintained streets in some towns) and on social facilities. The case of Douala is clear. 
            o High crime wave: Such crimes may include stealing, drug abuse, rape, murder, gambling, 
            etc. These crimes in most cases are perpetuated by jobless migrants. 
            o Pollution: The influx of people from the rural areas increases water, land, air and noise 
            pollution in urban areas. This often results from poor waste disposal, dumping of industrial 
            toxic waste, etc. 
            o Prostitution is rampant and becomes a profitable trade and the incidence of the spread of 
            sexually transmitted diseases increases. This is mainly because of unemployment and 
            frustration. 
            On a positive note, rural-urban migration may lead to greater development and increase in 
            the provision of social services like sport/games, electricity, hospitals/clinics, etc. This is as a 
            result of the increase in urban population. 
            III. Demographic Consequences 
            a. Rural Areas (Origin or Departure areas) 
            84 
            
            
            85 
            
             There will be depopulation in these areas. This is because the number of people who move 
            out of rural areas is more than the number that comes in especially in the case of 
            economically developing countries. Thus a reduction in population of rural areas. 
             Imbalance sex ratio: Generally, men are more prone to migration than women and it is not 
            uncommon for departure zones to become depopulated of their men folk while the reception 
            areas have an unfortunate lack of females. This makes the rural areas to be dominated by 
            females. However, this condition doesn’t remain the same for advanced countries as both 
            sexes are involved in migration. 
             The age structure differs between the rural and urban areas as rural areas become dominated 
            by the young (0-15years) and the Aged (65+) given that most of the adult population has 
            moved to towns. 
             There will be a drop in birth rate but death rate may remain high. The drop in birth rate is 
            mainly because most out migrants consists of the young adult population which is 
            biologically the most reproductive age group, leaving the children and aged who are 
            generally non-reproductive. 
             Dependency ration in the departure areas will be high. This is because the few adults who 
            remain in the rural areas have to take care of the many aged people and children. Thus the 
            burden on them tends to increase. 
            b. Urban Areas (Destination) 
             There will be an increase in the numerical strength of urban areas (i.e. total population) due 
            to the increasing influx of people from the rural areas contributing to the large population of 
            urban areas in developed and developing countries. 
             Imbalance sex ratio: In most urban areas, the age structure demonstrates a majority of young 
            and early older adult population (15-44years). In this age group, there is an excess of male 
            over females despite the increasing number of female migrants to towns nowadays. 
             The rate of population growth increases as many migrants are of childbearing ages. Birth 
            rates increase but death rates reduce resulting in rapid population growth especially in urban 
            areas of developing countries. 
            
            
            
            
            Ways of Limiting or Reducing Rural-Urban Migration and Solving Problems Created. 
            a. Measures to Curb or Limit Rural-Urban Migration 
             Provision of public utilities/amenities: The Cameroon government for instance has created 
            many schools and health centres in rural areas and has provided electricity to some rural 
            areas through her rural electrification programme. 
             Encouragement of rural development projects: Governments and local authorities 
            encourage the development of rural projects like pipe borne water supply, construction of 
            bridges and roads, the setting up of industries, agricultural projects, etc. These provides 
            employment to rural inhabitants and so help in reducing the rate of out migration. 
             Agricultural improvement: The governments of many countries have taken measures to 
            improve on agriculture given that it is the main economic activity in the rural areas. This has  
            been done by providing inputs like fertilizers, farm tools, pesticides/insecticides through 
            cooperatives or common initiative groups, etc. 
             Improvement in transport infrastructure: Governments of many countries have improved 
            on roads radiating from urban to rural areas with many being tarred. This has made 
            accessibility into the rural areas easy and facilitates movement of people, goods and services 
            into these areas 
             Provision of administrative services: Government administrative units/offices have been 
            extended to rural areas. This tendency of bringing administration closer to the rural dwellers 
            have helped to reduce the intensity of rural-urban migration. 
            b. Measures to solve problems created in towns 
             Urban renewal: This is a policy designed to regenerate decayed urban areas such as the 
            inner city. This is done through better town planning and urban redevelopment programmes. 
            It involves slum clearance, redevelopment of road infrastructure and making streets wider, 
            etc. 
             Decentralization of activities: Governments of many countries have encouraged the setting 
            up of new industries or the relocation of industries in the depressed or rural areas and 
            incentives for such relocation are which include tax concessions, loans at low interest rates, 
            etc are given. 
             Creation of new towns: New towns, well planned with better housing and employment 
            opportunities have been created in parts of some countries to relieve overcrowding and 
            86 
            congestion in the major towns by taking in the overspill population. E.g. Abuja in Nigeria, 
            Brasilia in Brazil. 
             Vertical construction of houses: To reduce the problem of housing and limited space in 
            some urban areas, there is the construction of storey buildings and skyscrapers. On the other 
            hand, the urban sprawl or the horizontal expansion of towns is often checked by the 
            establishment of Greenbelts e.g. around London, Birmingham, etc. 
             Zonation of activities: In most towns, particular activities are placed in specific zones in 
            order to reduce overcrowding e.g. industrial zones, commercial zones. This exists in 
            countries where there is proper urban planning. 
             More and better amenities like pipe borne water, electricity, hospitals, school, etc. are being 
            provided in an attempt to keep pace with the growing population of urban areas. 
            2. Rural-Rural Migration 
            This involves the movement of people from one rural area or village to another. 
            Causes of Rural-Rural migration 
            a. Rural population pressure: This is an important push factor which contributes to out 
            migration because high population density on land limits cultivable land area and thus people 
            who are unable to secure land for agriculture or settlement are forced to move out. 
            b. Infertile soil for agriculture: Given that agriculture is the mainstay of the rural areas, 
            infertile soils limit agricultural activities and therefore forces people out of such rural areas to 
            those with fertile soils. 
            c. Overpopulation: Rural overpopulation results from rapid population growth, which outstrips 
            resources. This is often indicated by the existence of high unemployment many landless 
            people, low incomes and living standards and possibly malnutrition and famine. Thus forcing 
            people out of such areas. 
            d. Intertribal wars: This mainly results from land disputes and have been responsible for 
            massive out movements from the affected areas to peaceful villages. They are common in the 
            North West region of Cameroon. E.g Bambili-Babanki, Balikumbat-Bafangi, Bali-Bawock, 
            etc. 
            e. Natural disasters: These may include floods, volcanic eruptions, toxic gas explosions which 
            may also cause out migration from one rural area to another. E.g the Mount Cameroon 
            eruption which affected the Bakingili village in South West (1999) and the Lake Nyos gas 
            explosion disaster (1986) in Wum. 
            87 
            3. Urban-Rural Migration 
            This involves the movements of people from the urban to the rural areas. It is not as 
            widespread as rural-urban migration but more prominent in the developed countries than in 
            developing countries where the reverse movement is more common. This movement does not 
            involve only people but also economic activities move away from urban areas (often termed 
            counter urbanization). 
            Causes of Urban-Rural migration 
            a. Push Factors 
            Retirement: A majority of old people when retired from their jobs in town prefer to move 
            out to the rural areas where there is calm, quietness and they are closer to nature. They also 
            prefer rural areas because their small pensions can sustain them here, as cost of living is 
            generally lower. 
            High cost of living: In most urban areas cost of living which is reflected in house rents, 
            medical bills, cost of feeding, clothing, etc is high and the most affected are the unemployed 
            or those with low incomes or pension. The inability of such people to sustain a living forces 
            them to abandon the urban areas and move to the countryside. 
            High land value (cost of land): The increasing population in urban areas often results in 
            limited space and since the population needs land for settlement and other activities like 
            industries, there is scramble for the limited land thereby increasing the cost of land and forces 
            those who cannot afford it to move to rural areas. 
            b. Pull Factors 
            Low cost of living: The cost of living is generally lower in the rural areas and this attracts 
            many migrants especially the old who can afford a livelihood with their meager pensions or 
            incomes. 
            Agricultural attraction: Many people are attracted to the rural areas by the urge to carry out 
            agricultural activities given the abundant, more fertile and cheaper land in these areas. 
            Improvement in transport facilities: Improvement in roads, railways, and air transport 
            systems has formed an easy link between the urbanites and rural counterparts. Thus 
            movements from urban to rural areas are now easier and cheaper. 
            Factory/industrial development: Decentralisation of economic activities has led to the 
            development of industries, shopping centres, etc in the countryside. These provide 
            employment avenues and thus attract many people from the urban areas. 
            88 
            
            
            89 
            
            Abundant and cheap land: Enough land is available and at lower cost in rural areas and this 
            attracts population for all types of development i.e. residential, industrial, shopping centres, 
            moving away from the crowded urban areas. 
            Environmental attraction: The clean, calm and quiet environment of rural areas (closer to 
            nature) attracts many people from the urban areas. They move away from the hustles and 
            bustles of urban areas. 
            Consequences of Urban-Rural Migration 
            a. Urban Areas (Origin or Departure) - Depopulation of urban areas i.e. the total population of urban areas reduces. - Movement of people out of urban areas reduces the problems of congestion and 
            overcrowding on social amenities, housing problems. - Helps to reduce the rate of unemployment. 
            b. Rural Areas (Destination) - Villages become growth poles that is, new points of economic development. This is due to 
            the fact that returning migrants who have worked enough money in towns carry out 
            developmental projects like small and medium size industries, etc. - Rural areas gain more labour from urban areas - Distortion of natural beauty in rural areas as natural vegetation is destroyed for other 
            activities. - Increasing cost of living in rural areas as the increasing number eventually exerts great 
            pressure on the resources of rural environments. 
            4. Intra-Urban Migration 
            This is the movement of people within the same urban area or from one part of the town to 
            another. This may be from the inner city to the suburbs or vice versa. A major factor of intra
            urban migration is place utility (which is a measure of attractiveness or unattractiveness of an 
            area, relative to alternative locations as perceived by the decision maker).  
            Factors (causes) of migration from the inner cities to the outer zones (suburbs) within 
            the same urban area. 
            a. Social Push – Push Factors - In the inner city, housing conditions are poor as there is grossly insufficient amenities, high 
            density and overcrowding. On the other hand, modern and high quality houses with amenities 
            and low density prevails in the suburbs. All these attract migrants from the inner city. 
            - - - - - - - 
            Inner cities are characterized by congestion, noise and air pollution from traffic and 
            industries, high crime wave, etc. This triggers off movements towards the suburbs with 
            cleaner environments, lower crime rate and less vandalism. 
            Insufficient and older services available to the population like schools and hospitals ethnic 
            and racial tension given the heterogeneous nature of such areas trigger out migration towards 
            the suburbs. 
            b. Economic Push – Pull factors. 
            Narrow and unplanned roads with limited parking space have created transportation 
            difficulties with a lot of delays in the inner city. It is therefore a reason for people to move to 
            the suburbs where there is a well-planned road system with wider streets, close to motorways 
            and ring roads. 
            Decline in older (traditional) secondary industries with congested sites in the inner city also 
            causes out migration given that this often results in much unemployment. While in the 
            suburbs, there has been the growth of modern industrial estates, footloose and service 
            industries, hypermarkets and regional shopping centres on cheaper and specious sites. 
            High rate of unemployment, lesser skilled jobs in traditional industries triggers out migration 
            from the inner city. On the contrary, the lower rate of unemployment and often more skilled 
            jobs in newer high-tech industries attract migrants to suburbs. 
            Land in the inner city is limited and expensive and thus, little or no space for parks and 
            individual gardens. This pushes migrants to the suburbs where there is abundant and cheap 
            land. 
            Limited planning and investments, large scale redevelopment and clearance also contributes 
            to out migration of people from inner cities while better planning, public and private 
            investments and high incomes and wealth attract migrants to the suburbs. 
            Consequences. 
            There would be a decrease in the population of the inner cities but an increase in the outer 
            zones or suburbs. 
            The inner cities are often left with a higher proportion of low-income families, handicapped 
            people, the elderly, single-parent families, the unemployed, recent immigrants, people with 
            few skills and limited qualifications. 
            90 
            
            
            91 
            
            The suburbs attract people of middle age, married with a growing family, possessing higher 
            skills and qualification, earning higher salaries and capable of buying their own homes and 
            cars. 
            A lot development in the inner city often leads to destruction of natural beauty of this 
            countryside. 
            5. Inter – Urban (Urban to Urban) Migration 
            This involves movement from one urban area to another. This movement is often associated 
            with differences in the level of development between towns in a country. Movements are 
            usually from towns with lower level of socio-economic development to those with high 
            levels. E.g. Bamenda to Douala, Bertoua to Yaounde, etc. 
            Causes of Inter – Urban Migration 
            a. Push Factors 
            Economic Push Factors 
             Movements away from departure town may be triggered by the inability to secure a job 
            (unemployment), absolute poverty, low wages and poor working conditions. 
             Increasing cost of living in terms of cost of feeding, Housing (rents), social bills, etc have 
            also contributed to the displacement of people from one town to another. 
             Overpopulation in some towns resulting in resource scarcity, unemployment, overcrowding 
            on amenities like schools, hospitals etc may also trigger off a lot of out migration to other 
            towns. 
             Improvement in transport links between the departure and receiving towns. 
            Social Push Factors 
            Limited or inadequacy of social amenities and services like educational and medical 
            facilities, electricity, pipe borne water, good housing may also trigger off out migration from 
            the departure town. 
            b. Pull Factors 
            Economic Factors 
             Availability of a wide range of job opportunities. In most countries, there are some towns 
            that are economically more developed than others possessing many industries, commercial 
            activities, a well-developed transport etc. 
             Higher incomes, better working conditions and high living standards are also some economic 
            pull factors, which attract migrants from one town to another. 
            Social Factors 
             Availability of a variety and better amenities in one town like better medical and educational 
            facilities, pipe borne water, housing, etc may act as a pull factor to migrants from other 
            towns. 
             Government policy of decentralization of socio-economic facilities, creation of new towns 
            and equipping them with better social amenities, transport development, industries, etc may 
            also attract migrants from other towns. 
            Consequences 
             Overcrowding/congestion  in receiving town 
             Increasing cost of living 
             Decrease population at departure town but increase in receiving towns. 
             Economic backwardness in departure town and greater economic progress in the 
            economically more developed towns. 
            6. Commuting (Daily Migration) 
            Commuting is a regular daily movement of people from their residences to their work places and 
            back. The migrants involved are known as commuters. A commuter is therefore a person who 
            lives in one community and works in another.  
            Types of commuting 
            a. Rural – Urban: This is where the commuter lives in a small town or village and travels to 
            work in a larger town or city. Here, there is rarely much movement in the reverse direction. 
            The commuter village is sometimes referred to as a dormitory village or a suburbanized 
            village. 
            b. Intra – Urban: This is where people who live in the suburbs travel into the city centre for 
            work. This category now includes inhabitants of inner-city areas who have to make the 
            reverse journey to the edge of the city’s industrial estates and regional shopping centres. 
            c. High Class: This includes businessmen, administrators and intellectuals. Their research work 
            or the need for personal contacts requires certain residential conditions. They may therefore 
            either live in the capital or other large city though their work may lie in a distance and less 
            important place or live in a highly specialized locality and commute to the centre for their 
            business activities. 
            92 
            - - - - - - - - - - 
            Reasons for Commuting 
            Improvements in the various modes of transport –roads, railways have made travel easy and 
            reliable. 
            The increase ownership of private cars facilitates easy movement of commuters and reduces 
            travelling time to city centres. 
            Industrial and commercial development in the city centres exercise a powerful attraction for 
            labour so that in the morning, it exerts a centripetal force as commuters converge from all 
            directions while in the evening it exerts a centrifugal force as commuters radiate outwards 
            and homewards. 
            Increase per capita income/high salaries that enable commuters to afford travelling costs. 
            Inadequate and high cost of housing in urban areas. This forces people to look for cheaper 
            housing further away from their work places e.g Southeast England. 
            The desire of many urban dwellers to live in rural or semi-rural environments. People feel 
            that their need to live in calm and cleaner environments outweighs the disadvantages of time 
            and cost of travel to work. 
            Modern housing is a long way from either the older inner-city industrial areas or from the 
            C.B.D. Thus people prefer to stay in such areas of modern houses and commute regularly to 
            and from the city centre. 
            The establishment of industrial estates and regional shopping centres further from the city 
            centre often results in a reverse movement where people move from the city centre to work in 
            such areas. 
            There is now more flexible working hours that allow people to travel during non-rush hour 
            times. 
            People prefer to stay in the suburbs to avoid the noise, congestion/overcrowding, pollution 
            and other socio-economic inconveniences associated with the city centres and the general 
            hustle and bustle in urban areas. 
            Effect or Consequences of Commuting. 
            a. Positive Consequences or Advantages of commuting. 
             It helps to reduce the housing problems which characterize towns and cities. 
             It enables great centres of economic activity to recruit sufficient manpower. 
            93 
             It permits people to carry out other activities e.g part time agriculture in rural areas given the 
            presence of cultivable land which help to subsidies their living. 
             It reduces pressure on social services and amenities in urban areas. 
             It leads to improvement in transport so as to enable easy movement of people. 
             It encourages socio-economic development around suburbs as people stay here, work in the 
            inner city and then carry out development in these areas. 
            b. Negative Consequences or Disadvantages of Commuting. 
             There is usually overcrowding/congestion in buses, trains and on roads during rush hours 
            (morning and afternoon). This may cause delay to work and a lot of inconveniences leading 
            to a fall in output in some cases. 
             A considerable amount of time is wasted on these daily journeys which often results in 
            fatigue and even ill-health especially if the distances covered each day are long. 
             Daily journeys to work represent a heavy economic change, which falls on the individual’s 
            purse. 
             The high volume of traffic increases the risk of accidents. The incidence of vehicle accidents 
            has increased especially during rush hours. 
             Commuting results in urban expansion. This urban sprawl encroaches on agricultural land, 
            thus reducing it and the outcome is a reduction in output. 
             It has led to an increase in noise and air pollution due to sounds of numerous vehicles and the 
            emission of smoke from the exhaust pipes of vehicles. 
            C) International or External Migration 
            This includes all movements involving the crossing of national frontiers or it involves the 
            movement of people from one country to another or from one continent to another. 
            Characteristics of International Migration. - -  
            It is relatively easier to obtain statistics on international migration at the entry or exit points 
            than internal migration, although illegal and clandestine migration makes records and 
            analysis very faulty in certain situations. 
            International migration unlike internal movements affects the total population of a country 
            either by increasing at the receiving country or decreasing at the departure country. - 
            The general cost involved in international migration is higher than in internal movement i.e. 
            cost of transport, feeding, etc. 
            94 
            - - - 
            A lot of documents are required to be made before undertaking external migration as 
            compared to internal migration. Examples include passports, visas, health documents, etc. 
            It difficult to assess the future of international migration given that migrations are the main 
            unknown component of population projections and estimates. 
            Migrants involved in international migration have to face a totally different physical and 
            socio-economic environment. E.g. new climate, culture, institutions, political system etc. 
            Causes (Determinants) of International Migration 
            a. Economic Factors 
            Push Factors 
             Economic backwardness often characterized by low level of industrial development, poor 
            transport development, mass unemployment, generalized poverty, low incomes and standards 
            of living have contributed to the movement of people out of such countries.  
             Economic crises faced by countries also triggers movements into other countries. These 
            crises which most African countries experienced in the later part of the 20th century led to 
            rampant movements of people to neighbouring countries. 
             Crop failure/famine. This is also a major reason which may force people to emigrate. 
            Drought, blight, floods and other negative environmental conditions often lead to crop failure 
            and therefore food shortages. This could trigger off wide scale emigration. 
            Pull Factors 
             Economic opportunities may attract migrants from poor to rich countries. Some of the 
            economic opportunities at the destination that may attract migrants include the availability of 
            and better job opportunities in industries, transport, commercial activities etc, better working 
            conditions, higher wages and living standards. 
             Presence of abundant and rich natural resources like minerals, forest wealth, and agricultural 
            products. 
            b. Demographic Factors 
            Push factors 
             Overpopulation/population pressure: This has played a great role in emigration. 
            Overpopulation is a situation where there is an excess of population over potential and 
            utilized resources. Thus the available resources cannot sustain the population because of 
            much population pressure on these resources. This often results in unemployment, famine, 
            95 
            food shortages, landless labourers, etc. This has contributed to high rate of emigration. For 
            example Ethiopia, Kabylie area of Algeria, etc. 
            Pull factors 
             Favourable immigration policies: The immigration policies of some countries have attracted 
            many migrants from other countries. In the 19th century, there was greater freedom of entry 
            than there is today. Examples of countries that practiced this are USA, Australia, New 
            Zealand, and France. 
            c. Political Factors 
            Push factors 
             War: This has been responsible for massive movements across borders into other countries in 
            the past and present. When there is war in a country, many people escape for safety without 
            taking into consideration the distance into neighbouring peaceful countries. Such migrants 
            are termed refugees. For example civil war in Sudan, first and second world wars, etc. 
             Forced international migration can also be triggered off because people in the country may 
            disagree with the ideology of the government in power or a totalitarian regime. Such people 
            may be persecuted and always threaten with arrest and detention and even killing. Many of 
            such people have been forced to emigrate and seek political asylum like refugees in other 
            countries. 
             Dictatorial policies of government may generate racial tension in the country and trigger off 
            international movements. E.g. the apartheid policy in South Africa made the white minority 
            to discriminate against the black majority causing many black South Africans to forcefully 
            migrate to neighbouring countries like Botswana, Zimbabwe, etc. 
            Pull factors 
             In peaceful countries where the freedom and lives of people are guaranteed, many people 
            would be attracted into such countries. For example USA, Canada Western Europe attract 
            many migrants from various parts of the world. 
            d. Religious Factors 
            Push factors 
             Religious Intolerance: This aspect was responsible for the emigration of the Pilgrim Fathers 
            in 1620 from Britain to North America and the Huguenots from France to America. They 
            moved mainly for the preservation of their faith. 
            96 
             Religious conflicts between two religious groups may also trigger off international migration 
            e.g. the clashes between the Muslims and Hindus in Pakistan made about six million Hindus 
            to involuntarily migrate from Pakistan to India. 
            Pull factors 
             Religious tolerance or freedom may act as a pull factor and attract many religious groups that 
            have suffered persecution in other countries. This is the case of most if not all western 
            democracies. 
            e. Environmental Factors 
            Push factors 
             Harsh or adverse physical environmental conditions such as drought which often results in 
            crop failure and thus low agricultural output leading to widespread famine, may induce 
            forceful international movements. This is the case of the Sahel regions of Africa. 
            Pull factors 
             Attractive environments free from natural disasters may act as a pull factor to migrants. Also 
            environments with a lot of tourist attractions may encourage international tourist movements. 
            The attractive mountain scenery, lake, waterfalls, rivers, etc in countries like Cameroon, 
            Switzerland, Kenya, etc. 
            Reasons for the increasing volume of international migration. - - - - 
            The collapse of the economies of most LEDCs that has resulted in large-scale 
            unemployment. For example Africa and most Latin America and Asian countries. This large 
            scale unemployment has triggered off large volumes of migration into the MEDCs where 
            jobs are available. 
            Increase wealth in the MEDCs. This makes them more attractive and guarantees the ability to 
            pay the cost of international migration by its citizens. In the LEDCs, the average incomes are 
            on the rise and so they can afford the cost of external movements. 
            There has been an overall improvement in the means of transportation (that is road, railway, 
            air and water). This has made movement easier, cheaper and faster. 
            Increase in global security. Even though sporadic terrorist attacks still occur in the world, the 
            world is now generally a safer place to work and move in than even before. This has 
            encouraged more movements between countries. 
            97 
            - - - - - 
            Globalization that has ensured the free circulation of businesses (trade) and their attendant 
            populations. 
            The rise in specialized education. Most major schools for particular studies are located in 
            specific countries. Many nationals therefore leave their countries into these countries to 
            acquire this education. 
            The development of efficient communication systems such as internet services and mobile 
            phones. This has increased the amount of information about destinations and thus 
            encouraging and increasing the number of international migrants. 
            The widening of association of nations. Regional groupings as CEMAC, ECOWAS, and EU 
            are widening their membership with time and relaxing barriers to movements between its 
            member states. This has fostered the free movement of people between these nations. 
            The growth of mass tourism. With the increase in incomes and improvements in the means of 
            movement, many more people stream to Southeast Asia, Latin America and East Africa for 
            leisure each year principally from economically developed countries. 
            Consequences of international migration. 
            a. Demographic consequences 
            1. Origin or Departure country 
             The departure country or region will become depopulated, that is a reduction in the total 
            population as a result of emigration. 
             The age-sex structure is affected. Usually there is an imbalance in the age composition and 
            sex ratio especially as such long distance migrations are both age and sex selective, males are 
            more prone to migration than females. 
             Decrease in the rate of population growth as a result of a fall in birth rate. This is because a 
            majority of emigrants are young adults and therefore, those most likely to bear children. 
             The age selective effects of emigration often results in an increase in the dependency ratio at 
            the origin. This is because the many children and the old who are left behind depend on a few 
            adults since most of the productive age group gas emigrated. 
            2. Receiving country 
             Increase in the rate of population growth as a result of increase in birth rate given that most 
            immigrants are of the reproductive age group. 
            98 
             Age-sex imbalance. The receiving regions usually experience an increase in the young adult 
            age group dominated by males due to the age and sex selective effects of migration 
            especially over longer distances. 
             The age-sex pyramids of reception areas are also affected. The pyramid on the adult male 
            side bulges indicating an increase in the proportion of this age/sex group. 
             There may be a reduction in dependency ratio as most immigrants are adult males (active 
            population) who can work to support the other age groups. 
            b. Economic consequences 
            1. Origin/Departure country. 
             Massive emigration often leads to a loss of the younger and active sector of the economy 
            resulting in a reduction or shortage of labour force. This may lead to a fall in productivity of 
            the land and industrial sectors. 
             Reduction in unemployment. Emigration usually relieves the origin of labour surpluses and 
            reduces the problems of unemployment in regions suffering from it. This may stimulate the 
            economy and lead to socio-economic development and an improvement in living standards. 
             When migrants return home, they may bring new skills, ideas, experience and innovations 
            that will aid in the socio-economic development of the economy. 
             The economic effects of remittance sent home is also important. Many international migrants 
            maintain links with their country of origin. 
            2. Destination/Receiving country 
             The massive influx of mostly young adults may provide a valuable source of labour which 
            increases the labour supply of the country. 
             Tourist financial benefits may also help to improve on the balance of payment situation of 
            the receiving country. 
             The market potential of recipient countries increases given the population increase. There is 
            more demand for gods and services especially as most migrants buy various items and send 
            to their home countries. 
             The receiving countries may suffer from unemployment especially in countries where the 
            influx does not correspond with the available employment opportunities and migrants are 
            unskilled. This may further create an informal sector in the economy. 
            c. Socio-Cultural consequences 
            99 
            1. Origin/Departure country. 
             Emigration whether voluntary or involuntary often leads to the breaking up of deeply 
            cherished family and friendly ties and creating an imbalance within the community left 
            behind. 
             Massive emigration may also lead to underutilization of social services/amenities like 
            schools, pipe borne water, electricity, etc if they have been provided. 
             Emigration may lead to the loss of a significant proportion of the highly educated and skilled 
            population to other countries where better opportunities (employment, higher wages, etc) are 
            offered (Brain drain). 
            2. Destination/Receiving country 
             Large scale immigrants bring pressure and even overcrowding on social services and 
            amenities of receiving countries like educational and medical facilities, water supply, etc. 
            This is a financial burden to the government. 
             The receiving country may also benefit a significant proportion of highly skilled and 
            educated professional population like teachers, medical doctors, engineers, scientist. These 
            groups of people bring in new ideas, skills and innovations highly advantageous to the 
            economy. 
             At the destination, immigration results in the mixing of races leading to the development of 
            multi-racial societies. E.g. USA, South America, etc 
             The mixing of diverse races and cultures is a source of tension or friction in many countries 
            e.g. it has been one of the causes of racial discrimination and friction in countries like 
            Canada, USA, South Africa, etc. 
             One of the most sensible social effects of international migration is the fact that some 
            immigrants are usually less law-abiding than residents. This however depends much upon 
            their integration and absorption into community life. 
             The culture of the recipient country is affected. Immigrants contribute in changing the 
            original cultural practices of a people. European art, music, way of dressing, language, 
            literature, philosophy, ethics, feeding habits, etc have spread widely in the developing 
            countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America mainly because of European immigration into 
            these areas from historic times till date. 
            100 
            D) Forced Migration (Refugeeism/Internally Displaced Persons – IDPs) 
            These are involuntary movements involving people who are forced by undesirable 
            circumstances to leave their country of origin to other countries. The term refugee comes 
            from the Latin word “fugere” meaning “to flee”. There are two categories of people under 
            this class; 
             Externally Displaced persons: They are people who have been forced out of their countries 
            for political or religious reasons or by natural disasters. These therefore are refugees. 
             Internally Displaced Persons: They are those who have been forced from their homes for 
            refugee-like reasons, but who remain within the borders of their own country. They are thus 
            not refugees because they are still under the jurisdiction of a government that might not want 
            international agencies to help them. They are found in Cameroon and many other countries. 
            Characteristics of Refugees. 
             A majority of refugees are found in developing countries about four-fifth of them. 
             Half of the world’s refugees are children of school age. 
             Most adult refugees are females. 
             Most of Africa’s refugees are rural to rural migrants. 
             Refugees usually live in extreme poverty and lack of food, shelter, clothing, education and 
            medical care. 
             They live in camps often characterized by water problems, poor waste disposal and poor 
            sanitary conditions. 
             They rarely have citizenship and few (if any) civil, legal or basic human rights.  
             Rapid spread of diseases in refugee’s camps with little or no medical attention. 
            Causes of Refugee/Internally Displaced Persons Movements. 
            a. Political factors: Political instability (wars, dictatorial governments) is a major cause of 
            refugee movements and has thus been responsible for the widespread displacement of people 
            from one country to another. 
            b. Natural disasters: Floods, landslides, volcanic eruptions, droughts, earthquakes/tsunamis are 
            natural disasters which have provoked refugee flows in areas where they occur and are 
            persistent. For instance floods in Maputo in Mozambique in the year 2000. 
            101 
            c.  
            Religious persecution/conflicts: This situation generates refugee flows. For instance 
            religious conflicts between Christians and Moslems in Sudan since the mid-1960s and in 
            2004/2005 led to the displacement of thousands of Sudanese to neighbouring countries. 
            d. Ethnic cleansing: This is the policy or practice of driving out of an area the people of one 
            race or religion by those of another. This has provoked a lot of refugee movements. For 
            example the violence and elimination of Albanians in Kosovo (in Yugoslavia) by Serbians in 
            1999. 
            e. Economic factors: The acute labour shortage in the sugar, cotton and tobacco plantations in 
            North and South America provoked the forceful movements of slaves from Africa to 
            America to work in these plantations. 
            f. 
            Accidents: The Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 in former USSR (present day CIS) which 
            was the result of a flawed reactor design that was operated with inadequately trained 
            personnel and the Bhopal chemical plant explosion in India sparked off massive refugee 
            movements as these accidents rendered thousands of people homeless. 
            Consequences of Refugee Movements 
            a. Departure country 
             There would be depopulation. The massive out flow of people reduces the total population 
            and population pressure on resources. This helps to relieve the region/country of its 
            overpopulation problems. 
             Loss of active population leading to a fall in labour force. This may lead to 
            underdevelopment, fall in productivity and GNP leading to low standards of living. 
             Mass unemployment, food shortages, poverty especially in countries devastated by war. 
             There may be some improvement in living standards as the massive outflow of population 
            reduces pressure on resources. 
             A drop in the rate of population growth as many people of the reproductive age group move 
            out. 
            b. Receiving countries 
             Increase in total population 
             Creation of camps mostly in the outskirts of the country to accommodate the excess 
            population. 
            102 
             Overcrowding/congestion on social/public amenities like schools, hospitals, pipe borne water 
            as the development of these aspects fails to keep pace with the number of refugees. 
             Food shortages which often lead to starvation, famine and deaths of many refugees. 
             High unemployment and poverty resulting in high crime wave like stealing, prostitution, drug 
            addiction, gambling. 
             Rapid spread of diseases like chicken pox, HIV/Aids especially in refugee camps. 
             Increase urbanization and urban problems like pollution, poor waste disposal, 
            accommodation problems, etc. 
             Living standards of refugees are very low given that they are unemployed and have to a large 
            extent depend on international humanitarian organisations for subsistence (food, drugs, etc.) 
             A lot of malnutrition especially among infants. This is due to poor diet and inadequate food 
            supply resulting in high infant mortality in refugee camps. 
             Age and sex imbalance – children and females dominate. The education of the children is 
            disturbed and there is overcrowding in schools. 
            Measures to Alleviate Refugee Problems 
             Development of refugee camps: The settlement area for refugees is usually provided by the 
            government of the receiving country. On such land, group houses or refugee camps have 
            been developed to provide lodging facilities to the homeless refugees. Such houses are 
            constructed with aid from national government, international organisations like UNHCR, 
            UNICEF. 
             Financial, material and moral support: This support is in the form of cash, food, clothing, 
            drugs, personnel and other basic needs. These are often provided by international 
            organization like UN through it agencies like FAO, humanitarian agencies like Red Cross, 
            etc. 
             Providing solutions to reasons for movement: The provision of solutions to political, 
            famine, natural disaster problems (reasons for the original out flow of the refugees) have led 
            to the voluntary repatriation or return of refugees to their home countries. 
             Development of projects: In order to help and re-integrate returnees, the UNHCR has 
            broaden its humanitarian assistance inside countries of origin by developing small scale 
            projects like in agriculture, small scale industries, etc aimed at meeting socio-economic needs 
            103 
            of the communities receiving large numbers of returnees and easing the resettlement of such 
            returnees. 
             Peace keeping forces: This is prominent in politically unstable or war torn countries. In this 
            case, international organisations like UN, African Union and NATO send a number of 
            military personnel in such countries to keep peace. These forces are usually given by some 
            countries and they go under the banner of the UN. 
            E) Inter – Regional Migration 
            This is the movement of people from one region to another. This could be between regions 
            within the same country or between countries. There are two types of inter-regional 
            movements. They are; 
             Colonizing migration: It takes place in regions which have not been inhabited for long but 
            provide good conditions for human habitation. These movements can be spontaneous or 
            planned. For example the movement of people into the Eastern region of Cameroon after 
            independence, the Westward movement in America in the Nineteenth century, etc. 
             The general drifts of population: They are usually from the less favoured regions to more 
            favoured ones. i.e it could be movement of people from a region of declining economic 
            importance to a region of booming economic growth. For instance, movement from the 
            western highlands towards the coast, drifts from Far North and Adamawa to towns of the 
            Centre and Littoral regions of Cameroon. 
            Causes of Inter – Regional migration 
            a. Physical factors 
            1. Push factors. 
             Regions with harsh climatic conditions like much cold or excessive heat, too wet or to dry 
            makes life difficult and forces people out of such areas. E.g the harsh climate of Far North 
            Russia. 
             Out migration is also triggered by rugged (rough) relief and poor (infertile) soils which 
            makes human activities like agriculture, road construction, etc difficult and livelihood 
            precarious. 
            2. Pull factors 
             Regions with favourable/equable climate, good relief, fertile soils and absence of natural 
            disasters are attractive to migrants and many would like to move to such areas. 
            104 
            b. Economic factors 
            1. Push factors 
             Unemployment i.e. limited opportunities in some parts of the country or region indicates that 
            poverty characterizes such regions and the people cannot meet up with their basic needs 
            leading to low living standards. Thus many people are therefore urged to move out. 
             Over population. This often leads to low per capita income and low living standards, 
            malnutrition thus triggers off movements. 
             Population pressure on land also forces people out of their area of origin to other regions as 
            there is limited land for agriculture and other activities. 
             Poor prospects in agriculture and industry or industrial decline have been responsible for out 
            migration. This may be due to limited capital, labour and even raw materials. 
            2. Pull factors 
             Availability of numerous employment opportunities, higher incomes/wages, better prospects 
            in agriculture and industry, lower cost of living and higher living standards, etc attracts 
            migrants from other regions. For example the movement of people into the centre and littoral 
            regions of Cameroon.  
             Existence of rich mineral deposit which attract rapid inflow of population e.g. the influx of 
            migrants into the Shaba province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
             Transport development is another encouraging factor of inter-regional migration. This is 
            because of the various transport modes like roads, railways, air making movements easier 
            and faster. 
            c. Social factors 
            1. Push factors 
             The lack or insufficiency of social or public facilities in the departure area such as 
            educational facilities, medical facilities, facilitates movements of people out of their origins 
            to other places. 
            2. Pull factors 
             The availability of these amenities in the receiving areas are attractive to migrants and thus 
            encourage movements into such areas. 
            105 
            d. Political factors 
            1. Push factors 
             Oppressive government policy of forced relocation as in the movement of Russians to Serbia 
            in the 1940s. 
             Poor governance and repressive government measures which often results in riots, wars 
            leading to loss of life and property. This often forces people to move out of the affected 
            areas. 
             Creation of new administrative units by the government or government policy of 
            decentralization where socio-economic opportunities move to depressed areas from 
            economically developed regions. When this takes place, workers may be transferred and they 
            are forced to migrate to such newly created administrative regions or districts. 
             Some people migrate when they disagree with the political ideology of the government in 
            power. 
            2. Pull factors 
             The existence of peace and freedom in particular regions or countries may act as a pull to 
            many migrants given that life and property is safe in such areas. 
             Good governance often provides fertile ground for peace and progress and limits political 
            agitation and therefore attracts migrants/investments. 
            e. Religious factors 
            1. Push factors 
             Religious persecution or intolerance forces religious groups concerned to migrate to other 
            areas where their religion can be practiced. 
            2. Pull factors. 
             Religious freedom and tolerance will act as a pull factor and would encourage or attract 
            migrants into such areas. 
            Consequences of Inter – Regional migration. 
            Demographic consequences 
            a. At origin or departure 
             Out movement here often leads to great loss of population especially the productive age 
            group resulting in a reduction in the population or depopulation. 
            106 
             It may also lead to a fall in fertility and growth rates given that a majority of the migrants are 
            in the reproductive age group. 
             Age-sex imbalances are also visible effects. 
             The population pyramid will show an indentation on the male side meaning loss through out 
            immigration given that males are more migratory. 
            At destination. 
             There would be a reduction in dependency ratios given that most migrants are active and 
            productive. 
             The age-sex pyramid would bulge on the male side showing a gain of young males. 
             It may lead to increase fertility, especially when migrants are poorer and less skilled or 
            educated. 
             Distorted age-sex structure given that mostly young adult males may dominate due to the age 
            and sex selective effects of migration. 
            b. Social consequences 
            At origin or departure 
             Under-utilization of few amenities available. 
             Limited provision of social services and amenities given the rampant out migration of people 
            and thus few people to use them. 
             The origin is deprived of its intellectual population i.e. brain drain/outflow of skills which 
            may result in under development. 
             Feedback of information and return of some migrants however loosens traditional social 
            structures and brings progress in the society through remittance. 
            At the destination. 
             More social services and amenities would be provided since there is an increase in population 
            who need these facilities. 
             May also result in a rich cultural mix in terms of language, traditions, inter-marriages, 
            feeding habits, etc. 
             There would be housing and communication difficulties. 
             There will be a boost in the intellectual and social and political life if migrants are educated 
            and thus bringing new ideas. 
            107 
             The influx of migrants results in a lot of social problems like congestion, overcrowding, land, 
            water, air pollution, etc.

            TOPIC: POPULATION GROWTH AND RELATION TO RESOURCES 
            USE/DEVELOPMENT 
            Lesson 16: Notion of Carrying Capacity 
            A) Meaning  
            The carrying capacity of an environment is the maximum potential number of people that the 
            resources of a particular area or environment can support. In other words, it is the level at which 
            the existing resources can sustain the expanding population. 
            B) Different ways of adjusting resources to carrying capacity 
            1. Instantaneous adjustment: here the rate of increase in population is unchanged until the 
            ceiling is reached. At this point (ceiling level), population growth suddenly stops and the 
            rate of increase becomes zero. This type of adjustment is very unlikely to occur in real life 
            and there is no evidence to support this from either human or animal populations. 
            2. Progressive or Gradual adjustment (the s-curve): Here population increase or growth 
            slows down gradually as it approaches the carrying capacity and then levels off when the 
            ceiling is finally reached. This situation is more realistic in life and occurs in most 
            developed countries where higher economic development and education have led to greater 
            birth control that slowed down the rate of population increase. 
            3. Progressive approximation or fluctuating gradual adjustment (the J-curve): In this 
            adjustment, the population rises and goes beyond or exceeds carrying capacity resulting in a 
            sudden check by such things like famine, war, diseases, birth control, etc. which causes a 
            fall in the total population. After some time, the population recovers and then fluctuates, 
            eventually settling down at the carrying capacity.  
            108 
            Lesson 17: Concepts of Population and Resources 
            A) Overpopulation 
            I) Meaning: It occurs or exists when there is an excess of population over utilized or potential 
            resources. In other words, it is a situation in which available resources are unable to provide 
            the population with a commendable standard of living or it is where population numbers far 
            exceeds the supporting capacities of the available resources in low standards. 
            Types of over population 
             Absolute overpopulation: It is a situation where there is a maximum exploitation and 
            utilization of resources, yet living standards remain low and there is no hope to transform 
            resources from stock. In other words, it occurs where the absolute limit of production has 
            been reached though living standards remain low. There is  a very rare occurrence of this 
            type. 
             Relative overpopulation: It is a situation wherein the population number is increasing faster 
            than the rate of resource development and present production is inadequate for the population 
            although there are chances for greater production. This type of overpopulation is very 
            common in countries like Bangladesh, Indonesia, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, etc. 
            II) Indicators of overpopulation. 
             Massive out-migration or emigration: This occurs mainly as a result of the high population 
            pressure on limited resources leading to food shortages, starvation, unemployment, etc. 
            thereby causing people to move out of the regions. 
             High rate of unemployment: In areas of overpopulation, the population numbers always 
            exceeds the available job opportunities. Thus the excess population would be unemployed. 
             Low per capita income: This is because the population number may be too large for the 
            limited resources. Low per capita income may also result from mismanagement of the 
            resources, capital flight, unexploitation of resources and not only from overpopulation. 
             Low average living standards: This is partly as a result of the low per capita income. It may 
            also result from the unexploitation of resources. 
             High population density: This may indicate that there is overpopulation in a society but it 
            should be noted that it is not in all cases where high densities indicates overpopulation. 
             Famine leading to hunger and malnutrition 
            109 
             High fertility, high but declining mortality resulting in rapid population growth and affecting 
            resources negatively. 
             Low exchange rate 
             Diminishing returns on factors of production 
             Population pressure on resources. 
             Increase landless labourers leading to high unemployment. 
             Low purchasing power although with a large market potential. 
            III) Measurements of overpopulation 
             Finding the per capita income 
             Investigating the level of employment 
             Existence of diminishing returns 
             Finding out the volume and direction of migration i.e. whether it is out or in migration. 
             Checking the life expectancy 
             Measuring the population density 
             Examining the changes in consumption pattern 
             Noting the changes, which exists in terms of international trade? 
            IV) 
            Causes of overpopulation 
             Decline in demand for labour 
             Increase in population 
             A decline in available resources. 
            V) 
            Consequences (See indicators above) 
            VI) 
            Solutions or checks 
            a. Demographic checks 
             Out migration should be encouraged while in-migration or immigration should be 
            discouraged. For example the overpopulation problem of Ireland, Britain and Italy in the 19th 
            century was relieved by massive emigration of people mainly to North America. 
             Control population growth. This can be done by the limitation of birth rates through the 
            implementation of birth control methods as the use of contraceptives, legalization of 
            abortion, sterilization of and family planning. 
            110 
            b. Economic checks 
             Agricultural development: This involves measures aimed at increasing agricultural output. 
            These measures include; increasing cultivable land area, improved and increased yields, 
            hybridization, and search for new food sources. 
             Industrial development: The establishment of industries in areas that have exclusively been 
            rural would help provide jobs to the large number of people and also process agricultural 
            produce, manufacture various farm chemicals and equipment like machines and other farm 
            inputs. 
             International trade: Trade between countries should be strengthen or improved upon as it will 
            enable food exports to be possible from countries that produce surpluses to countries 
            deficient in food production. 
             Finding more space: This has been done to create more space to accommodate the large 
            population numbers. There should be the vertical construction of houses e.g. storey buildings 
            or skyscrapers. 
            B) Under population 
            I) Meaning: It is a situation where there are far  more resources in an area (e.g. food 
            production, energy and minerals), than can be used by the people currently living there. In 
            other words, it is when the population is too small to utilize fully its resources or where the 
            resources and development could support a large population than the current one without 
            lowering the living standards or increasing unemployment. It therefore exist in places where 
            the resources are still intact or yet unexploited and its most likely to occur in developed 
            countries. Examples of under populated countries are; Canada, New Zealand, Gabon, Saudi 
            Arabia, Kuwait and the Amazon basin. 
            Types of under population 
             Absolute under population: This exists where population numbers are incapable of normal 
            demographic replacement or of adequate economic production. It is however very rare to find 
            this situation in the world given that population numbers may be increased by massive influx 
            (immigration) of people from other regions. The case of Australia, New Zealand, etc. 
             Relative under population: This is more visible in the real world and it occurs where there 
            are far more resources in an area like food production, than can be used by the people living 
            there. For example, the case of Canada. 
            111 
            II) Causes of under population 
             Better diet, good sanitary and health care which ensures fewer deaths of children (low infant 
            mortality) 
             High educational standards (or literacy level) create awareness of the advantages of small 
            families. 
             Better social welfare system, thus less need for more children as insurance against old age. 
             Better knowledge of birth control methods. 
             Careful or judicious use of available resources. 
            III) 
            Indicators of under population 
            a. In economically backward countries/regions 
             Presence of vast untapped resources given the low technology to exploit them. 
             Low per capita income and low living standards owing to the fact that the resources are 
            unexploited. 
             Possible inflow of migrants with foreign technology to exploit resources from which the 
            home country of the migrant is the main beneficiary. 
             Low socio-economic development. This is because in regions with few people, it is 
            uneconomic to provide good communication network, health, education and other facilities. 
             Low Human Development Index (HDI). 
            b. In economically advanced countries/regions 
             Luxurious average living standards given the high per capita income. 
             Existence of untapped resources mainly because they are much and not because of low 
            technology. 
             Wasteful usage of resources if not controlled 
             There would exist a small population ratio to utilized resources. 
             High rate of immigration 
             High HDI e.g. Canada, Sweden. 
            IV) 
            Measurements of under population (see measurements of overpopulation above) 
            V) 
            Solutions/ checks to under population 
             Immigration should be encouraged while emigration be discouraged. 
            112 
             In backward societies, under population may be resolved by improved medical facilities, diet 
            and declining mortality. 
             Government may encourage high birth rate by prohibiting all forms of birth control 
            measures. 
             Exportation of some of the resources to foreign countries deficient in them in the form of 
            foreign aid. 
             Transfer of technology and personnel to enable exploitation of idle resources. 
             Change in the agricultural system so as to stimulate agricultural expansion. 
            C) Optimum Population 
            a. Meaning: This is a population that achieves a given aim in the most satisfactory way. It is 
            however difficult to say but it lies somewhere in between under population and 
            overpopulation. Thus between the extremes of overpopulation and under population, there 
            exists optimum population. 
            Types of optimum population 
             Economic optimum: It is the maximum population number which can inhabit a given region 
            enabling a reasonable or highest standard of living under given or specific technical and 
            economic conditions. 
             Power optimum: This is the population which achieves the greatest level of production 
            above that which is required for its own subsistence. The power optimum is always higher 
            than the economic optimum as it requires government intervention as power represents are 
            collective aim which may take the form of enhancing development and increasing living 
            standards in the society. 
             Optimum rhythm of growth: This is the level of growth that best utilizes the resources and 
            technology available. It is a dynamic concept whereby population growth responds to 
            substantial technological advances which often results in an increases in the carrying capacity 
            of countries and regions and thus increases in living standards. 
            b. Indicators of optimum population. 
             Standards of living are usually averagely high with reference to diet, housing, health and 
            educational facilities, transport development, etc. 
             Level of employment: A situation of optimum population often exhibits full employment i.e. 
            a maximum of 2% rate of unemployment. 
            113 
             Demographic structure: There is a fairly balanced demographic composition of age, sex and 
            occupational structure. Birth and death rates are low. 
             Size of market is usually large with high purchasing power. 
             There is the rational development and use of increasing resources (sustainable management 
            of resources. 
             The area of cultivable land is relatively high with the use of a lot of agricultural inputs. 
            Factors influencing optimum population 
            a. Size of area: Generally if the geographical area is large, more resources would be found and 
            in such areas, the optimum population is likely to be attained. But where the size is small, 
            fewer resources would be found. 
            b. The geography of the area: Since resources may be abundant or scarce depending on the 
            optimum population would also vary. Thus in regions with abundant and exploited resources, 
            living standards would increase as opposed to regions with limited resources. 
            c. Stage of technological progress: With improvement in technology, more and more 
            resources can be discovered, exploited and thus optimum population can be achieved. 
            d. Quality of communication: With improvement in communication i.e. transport and 
            information technology, resources can easily move from one region or country to another. 
            Thus deficient regions would benefit from regions with surplus resources therefore 
            achievement of optimum population. 
            Optimum population as a dynamic concept. 
            The concept of optimum population is considered dynamic because it is not static but changes 
            over time and space in accordance with economic and social changes. These changes can either 
            be positive or negative thus leading to the achievement of optimum population or making it to 
            move towards overpopulation. The following aspects are responsible for this dynamism. 
            1. Changes in technology: Technological advances would obviously lead to the exploitation 
            and utilization of more resources of an area, giving rise to high per capita income and living 
            standards and would result in the establishment of a new higher equilibrium i.e. optimum 
            population. But where technology is stagnant or declines, resources are idle and remain 
            unexploited but the population may be increasing resulting in low per capita income and 
            standards of living which may change the situation from optimum to overpopulation. 
            114 
            2. Changes in demographic characteristics/structure: Where birth rate increases and death 
            rate is low, the result is a rapid increase in the total population. When population increases, it 
            has negative effects on resources. Also, more less productive youths dominate leading to a 
            new lower optimum as the population number is more than the available resources. But when 
            birth rate is checked and it reduces, total population also reduces and more productive adults 
            tend to dominate leading to a new higher optimum. 
            3. Discovery of new resources: If new resources are discovered through scientific research, 
            this would increase the stock or quality of resources, replace old ones which are exhausted 
            and lead to the establishment of a new higher optimum population. 
            4. Trade relations: The opening of new trading opportunities like markets with other regions 
            obviously increases the amount of resources and would lead to a higher optimum. But in the 
            case where old established trading opportunities have been lost, it would lead to a lower 
            optimum. 
            5. Decline in resources: A decline in resources may be caused by environmental hazards like 
            floods, drought, wars, etc. When this happens, it may lead to a new lower optimum or a 
            change from optimum to overpopulation because these may cause great destruction on 
            resources leading to drastic reduction. 
            6. Changes in territorial boundaries: Territorial expansion may result in an increase in 
            resources. This is because the new land adds to the existing cultivable land and may contain 
            some resources which may increase stock of resources of the country in question and 
            obviously leads to the establishment of new higher optimum. 
            Lesson 18: Theories 
            A) General views on population and resources 
            The views about population growth are very diversified and important in the study of the 
            relationship between food or resources in general and population growth. These views have been 
            divided into three major categories as follows; 
             Biological theories: These suggest that the influences on human population growth are 
            essentially the same as those regulating the growth in the numbers of plants and animals. It 
            has been argued for example that fertility diminishes and is regulated by population density. 
            The best example is the Malthusian theory. 
            115 
             Cultural theories: These suggest and hold that demographic growth is unique and emphasize 
            the importance of man’s reason and intellect in influencing his growth in numbers. The 
            declining birth rates in developed countries have been advanced as evidence of man’s ability 
            to control his growth in numbers. 
             Economic theories: They emphasize the importance of economic factors especially the 
            demand for labour as being the main influences on growth rates, patterns of migration and 
            population distribution. The main proponents of the view are the Marxist-Leninist 
            economists. 
            B) Malthus and Boserup’s Theories. 
            1. The Malthusian theory. 
            The Reverend Robert Thomas Malthus (1766 – 1834) was a British Demographer and 
            Clergyman. He was the leading and strong supporter of the idea of reduction in population 
            growth, published his view in 1798 in a document titled “Essay on the principle of Population 
            Growth”. Together with a group of his supporter who comprised of protestants, conservatives, 
            environmentalists, Americans, individuals all believed that restriction of growth was a necessity 
            in order to maintain the standard of living of the individuals. They were called the Malthusians 
            otherwise known as pessimists. This theory was based on two principles - 
            Britain at his time - - 
            That the population, when unobstructed or unchecked grows at a geometric or exponential 
            rate i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32………etc. and tends to double every 25 years as was the case of 
            That the means of subsistence, that is food supply even under excellent conditions only 
            increases at an arithmetic rate i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6…..etc. 
            His Aims 
            His model was out to investigate on how population growing unchecked will affect food supply. 
            His assumptions - 
            That the passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state i.e. 
            there is a universal tendency for the population to increase. 
            That food is necessary for existence of man. 
            Malthus in an attempt to solve this equation, he suggested some private or preventive checks and 
            positive or destructive checks which will help curb or reduce growth. 
            a. Private or preventive checks: They are those methods of limiting population growth 
            voluntarily by man. They include; 
            116 
            - - - - 
            Voluntary limitation of families through moral restraint (natural family planning) 
            Abstinence from sex till marriage 
            Encouragement of delayed or late marriages 
            Celibacy (not getting married and having no sexual relationship) and chastity (the state of not 
            having sex with anyone until the responsibilities of marriage could be accepted, thus having 
            sex only with the person you are married to). 
            b. Positive or destructive checks: These were checks imposed by the environment and are 
            geared towards reducing the population size involuntarily through increase in death rate. - - 
            Famine – which often results in starvation leading to an increase in deaths 
            Diseases, wars, poverty, pests, plagues and epidemics, natural disasters, infanticide, all of 
            which help to raise death rates and lead to low life expectancy. 
            Strength and weaknesses 
            a. Strengths (Application today) 
             It is on the basis of his principles that it is frequently advanced that foreign aid in developing 
            countries aggravates rather than relieves the problems of overpopulation. In line with 
            Malthus, population will increase to meet the improved level of subsistence. 
             Other Neo-Malthusian groups advocate massive birth control programmes in order to slow 
            down rates of increase. Thus many developed regions have controlled birth rate because of 
            the dangers of overpopulation, are thus accepting Malthus view. 
             It should be observed that in honour of Malthus that the concept of population ceiling that he 
            first used spurred up the development of an entire model on the carrying capacity of the 
            environment or population ceiling. 
             The case of many developing countries experiencing overpopulation with insufficient food 
            supply to equal the increasing population is living under conditions predicted by Malthus. 
            b. Weaknesses or negative criticisms. 
             The improvement in transport means allowed for more efficient trade between regions 
            making it possible and easier for food to be transported from areas of surplus to areas of 
            scarcity. 
             Improvements in agricultural techniques particularly intensification in the developed 
            countries which accompanied the agrarian revolution made crop yield to more than doubled. 
             New sources of food supply were also discovered in the seas and oceans. E.g fish resources 
            117 
             The industrial revolution helped to transform agricultural, mineral and other raw materials to 
            usable products which could sustain the growing population without a fall in living standards. 
             The massive implementation of birth control measures especially in developed countries 
            greatly reduced the rate of population growth. 
             High-density housing and cities have been built to solve the problem of shelter. 
             New material resources were discovered in regions hardly known during the time of Malthus. 
             The opening up of the New World (USA, Australia, New Zealand) and colonies not only 
            increased agricultural output but also provided an outlet for excess population in the form of 
            emigration thus reducing the population pressure on food resources in Europe. 
            2. Boserup’s Theory 
            Esther Boserup an optimist and a Danish economist developed her view about population growth 
            in 1965. Contrary to Malthus view, her she was a strong supporter of the idea of population 
            growth in line with that of Karl Marx. In her publication titled “the conditions of agricultural 
            growth” she suggested that in a purely subsistence society, an increase in population instead 
            stimulated agricultural production i.e. according to her, population growth enables agricultural 
            development to occur given that as the number of people increase, more food is needed to feed 
            them and so they have to develop techniques which would increase output. Hence necessity is 
            the mother of invention. 
             Her investigations - - - 
            At the earliest stage, small families subsist through forest fallow associated with shifting 
            cultivation. Here mainly crude tools like digging sticks and axes are used. 
            As population increases, the bush fallowing method is introduced with increasingly intense 
            cropping and the shortening of the fallow period. At this stage, hoes are use replacing the 
            digging sticks and manuring begins. 
            Further population growth is followed by a short fallow multiple-cropping system yielding 
            more than one harvest a year. Here, the plough is used thus replacing the crude tools making 
            it the most intensive system of agriculture with weeding becoming more frequent and 
            manuring is fully introduced. 
             Strengths or application today - 
            Since world war two, the general rapid increase in world population (baby boom) stimulated 
            great improvements in agriculture i.e. great efforts have been made to improve agriculture 
            and in particular to increase crop yield by a more intensive and efficient use of land. 
            118 
            - 
            Many countries where population is increasing or those facing population pressure have 
            undertaken agricultural development or improvement schemes or programs aimed at 
            revolutionizing agriculture and increasing output. This is because the increase in population 
            means increasing mouths to feed. E.g. green Revolution in Cameroon, Operation feed the 
            Nation in Nigeria, etc. 
             Weaknesses or negative criticisms - 
            Boserup assumed that people knew of the techniques required by more intensive systems and 
            that when the population grew, they would be willing to adopt them. This is not necessarily 
            true because in most parts of developing countries new techniques are unknown and even 
            when they become known, many people are still unwilling to adopt them. - - - - - - 
            She has also been criticized for describing agricultural systems simply in terms of intensity of 
            production. This is because different types of systems occur at a given intensity. 
            Her thesis does not take into consideration other growth factors like migration which may 
            lead to a rapid increase in population and affect the amount of food supply. 
            She did not foresee the disastrous effects of natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, etc 
            on agriculture which may lead to crop failure resulting in acute food shortage and negatively 
            affecting the growing population. 
            She neglected the operation of the law of diminishing return that besets agricultural 
            production even when new techniques are used. When this sets in, it slows down agricultural 
            productivity so that it can no longer keep pace with population growth. 
            Also, numerous bottlenecks and blueprints presented by governments especially in 
            developing countries slow down the application of new techniques where they are known. 
             Similarities between Malthus and Boserup - 
            Boserup’s idea of population growth is similar to that of Malthus only in the short-run in that 
            population is growing more than food resources. 
            Both views are tilted towards examining the relationship between population growth and the 
            rate of increase in food resources. Thus both compared and showed a complementarity of 
            ideas rather than an absolute negation of others ideas. 
             Contrasts. - 
            Population does not decline in Boserup but it does at a certain point in Malthus. 
            119 
            - - - - 
            To Boserup food resources grow more than population I the long run due to the adoption of 
            new techniques caused by population growth while Malthus says an increase in population 
            will instead bring about disaster if not checked as there will be food shortages. 
            Malthus was a British  demographer and developed his theory in the late 18th century that is 
            in  1789 while Boserup a Danish economist develop her theory I the 20th century that is in 
            Malthus’s theory explains situations of overpopulation, whereas that of Boserup pertains to 
            situations of under population. 
            To Boserup, food resources continue to expand and the gap between food and population 
            widens while in Malthus food resources drop and the gap narrows until where population 
            catches up with food resources and goes beyond.

            SETTLEMENT GEOGRAPHY 
            MODULE 5: UNDERSTANDING AND MANAGING OF SETTLEMENT DYNAMICS 
            ACROSS THE WORLD IN GENERAL AND CAMEROON IN PARTICULAR 
            GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
            Settlement is the central to human geography as it form the basis through which man can adapt 
            the environment to suit his own ends and it is through settlement that we have the most visible 
            sign of human culture being imposed on nature. As such, settlements which are studied at the 
            local, regional or global scale as well as in isolation or linked to other aspects of geography like 
            soil, climate, vegetation, etc. have long been of interest to geographers in terms of their forms, 
            sites and situations, patterns, distribution and their tendency towards change. 
            TOPIC: SETTLEMENT DEVELOPMENT 
            Lesson 1: Settlement 
            A) Meaning of settlement 
            The meaning of the word ‘settlement’ varies from region to region. At one end, it is considered 
            as “the grouping of human dwellings into urban and rural”. In another way, it is the buildings, 
            together with the tracks, roads, railways which may be an individual house or several houses 
            together with schools, shops, banks, cinemas and hospitals. Again, it refers to “any form of 
            human habitation where the inhabitants carry on variety of activities such as agriculture, trade, 
            manufacturing, defense, etc. ranging from a lone building (single isolated farmstead), to the 
            largest cities and conurbations of the world. 
            B) Evolution of settlement 
            Since settlements are not static but constitute some of the most dynamic aspects of the human 
            environment, thus studying their changing patterns therefore occupies a significant place in 
            settlement geography. The development and evolution of settlements started almost at the same 
            time man landed on earth but have since then evolved in various stages as follows 
             The period around 8000 BC (end of the last ice age): At this period settlements were band 
            of nomadic hunters and gatherers living in subtropical lands at subsistence level. During this 
            
            
            period (the stone-age) people were very migratory and the whole community was involved in 
            the search for food. i.e. living a hand to mouth life gathering just what they can eat. (the stage 
            of the early man governed by the principle of “the bread of tomorrow comes tomorrow”). 
             The period around 5000 – 6000 BC: At this time, two major technological changes known 
            as the “Neolithic Revolution” (First domestication of animals like sheep, cattle, goats. The 
            second the cultivation of cereals like rice, wheat and maize) occurred. This was the period 
            early man discovered agriculture, turning the migratory hunter-collector groups into a 
            sedentary farmer. The first permanent communities emerged though independently but at the 
            same time around rivers valleys/basins like the Nile (Egypt), Tigris and Euphrates 
            (Mesopotamia) and Lower Indus valley (India). All these developed almost at the same time 
            influenced by climate, soil, relief, etc. 
             The settled life necessitated a look towards a permanent system of communal living. This 
            was for reasons of friendship, mutual help and protection from enemies. In some cases, this 
            led to extreme clustering (Tukano Indians of Columbia). Settlements however consisted of 
            separate dwellings built in groups to varying degrees of compactness. This sedentary new 
            phenomenon of life saw the rapid development of non-farming activities like trade, 
            administration, engineers to introduce and maintain irrigation systems, craftsman, legal 
            system and an army for defense etc.  
            C) Factors affecting location of early settlements 
            1. Nature of the landscape: Settlements where located on or near rivers courses, privileged 
            spits which has access to water or at points of easy defense against hostile neighbours. For 
            example early settlements started in in river valleys (access to water, safety from attack, 
            fertile alluvial soils and rich pastures on flood plains) as the case of Nile valley for Egyptian 
            settlements. 
            2. Resource base: This is the case of areas of fertile soils, which were sites for many settlement 
            developments and was common along river valleys especially as these abound with fertile 
            alluvial soils in oasis and volcanic mountains. Other rich resources bases sites where those 
            with fish and forest which all provide for the needs of settlers thereby establishing the basis 
            for settlement growth or decline. 
            3. Economic possibilities: This refers to investment potentials in settlement on the available 
            resources and their durability. River valleys were important not only for agriculture but also 
            for the development of trade through the navigable rivers. 
            
            
            4. Ethnographic factors: This involves tribal settlements that may encourage settlements and 
            may determine the location and shape. For example, the Fulanis usually locate their homes 
            far into the bush where they can easily look after their own livestock and their houses are 
            usually made of grass. 
            5. Religious influence: It creates a gregarious tendency in specific groups of people i.e. people 
            with similar religion tend to locate their settlements around their place of worship. For 
            example, the Moslems near the mosque and their homes are enclosed in fences, while 
            Christians on the other hand build around chapels or churches. 
            It should be noted that settlements arising from these factors are complex and dynamic and 
            constantly adjust to changing conditions with time. This dynamism is generated by the 
            interaction between people and the environment. Thus once settlements are established, an in 
            built germ for their evolution is set into motion. 
            Lesson 2: Site and Situation of settlements 
            A) Site: It describes the physical characteristics of the actual point on which a settlement (be it 
            rural or urban) is located. In other words, it is the actual spot or piece of land on which a 
            settlement is originally built or is standing. It can also be referred to as the physical 
            conditions of the land area or spot where the settlement is implanted. 
            
            Types and examples of site. 
            i. Resource base sites: These are points with specific resources such as minerals. Good 
            examples under this category are Lubumbashi in the Katanga province of Zaire (DRC), 
            fishing points as the fishing ports of Douala in Cameroon, etc. 
            ii. Highland sites: These are typically hilltops and mountain tops that hardly support large 
            settlements since their productivity is limited and route network development is difficult. A 
            few of these hilltops however support settlements for strategic reasons as they serve as 
            excellent defensive sites. Example Le Puy, Cordes, Mandara villages, Tibesti and 
            Mediterranean hilltop settlements. 
            iii. Water points: This has gained a status of an ideal site because of the importance of water to 
            man, his animals and crops. These sites take different forms depending on the physical 
            
            
            feature favouring the development of the point as there exist; spring line site, river-borne 
            sites and coastal sites with each of these having a sub. 
            iv. Lines of route sites: Towns which are located on transportation lines are those to which trade 
            routes were very important in their development. The French geographer ‘Vidal de la 
            Blanche said that routes are responsible for the development and growth of town. Prominent 
            route sites include; lake side location, narrow strait sites, halts on main roads, railway foci, 
            ship canal locations. 
            B) Situation: It describes the location of a settlement relative to its surrounding or in relation to 
            the rest of the region. i.e. it is the location in the regional framework or in relation in the 
            wider positional aspects or surrounding features as neighbouring settlements, communication 
            lines, agriculture, industrial, political, social, cultural regions and large physical features like 
            rivers, hills etc. In other words, it describes the quality of a site which together with human 
            and political factors determines whether or not a settlement would remain small or grow 
            larger. Settlement situations are classified into linear, frontier and central. 
            Examples of settlement situation 
             Stop point situations: These are long communication lines whose flow is interrupted at 
            certain points. They can either be; halt or caravan barriers (where traders have a halt along 
            their journeys for food or water, drink or pass the night. E.g. Timbuktu and Oases along the 
            Trans Saharan caravan routes), obstruction (where route ways are interrupted by rapids on a 
            river), transshipment or break of bulk point (points where goods have to be transferred from 
            one type of vehicle to another or between two transport systems). 
             Route convergence points: Settlements are likely to grow up at points where two or more 
            routes criss-cross or meet. This could be two valleys meeting or the confluence of a river. 
            Examples include Kuala Lumpur at the confluence of the Klang and Gambak rivers in 
            Malaysia. 
            C) Factors affection settlement site 
            a. Physical factors 
            1. Influence of water: Early settlements were sited where there was a guaranteed water supply 
            due to the fact that water has been of great importance to man since creation either for 
            consumption or for economic activities. For this reason, many early settlements were located 
            oases and water holes especially in semi-arid and arid areas where water is partially 
            restricted. 
            
            
            2. Need for defense: Many settlements exist at points today due to need of safety from attack in 
            the past. These settlements chose sites that ensured their safety and could easily be defended. 
            This is the case in the regions where there were frequent inter-tribal wars and attacks by land 
            and sea and political instability. Thus in an attempt to choose naturally defensive positions 
            they picked hilltops, rock outcrops and islands as safe refuge. For example, the Mandara 
            settlements in Cameroon were sited to avoid the Hausa raids. 
            3. Shelter and aspect (climate): Shelter from bad weather and out look to sunshine is other 
            factors of site especially in areas out of the tropics. In such areas, rain shadows or leeward 
            sides of hills are preferred to exposed windward sides. With regards to temperature, sun 
            facing slopes are preferred to sun shadow slopes. This factor explains the occurrence of the 
            numerous Bakweri villages on the mid slopes of Mount Cameroon and villages on the 
            Western highlands. 
            4. Agricultural land or food supply: Areas with land suitable for the growing of crops and 
            rearing of animals were very attractive. This is because sites where ideal locations for 
            guaranteeing food supply. This explains while most settlements started along river valleys as 
            Nile, Euphrates, Tigris, Indus, Ganges, Yangtze, and coastal plains. 
            5. Building material: Since shelter is one of the basic necessities of life, it is necessary to 
            consider where to obtain building materials from. This was much so because materials are 
            heavy and in most cases the original settlements developed where transport modes were 
            poorly developed. They therefore choose settlement sites close to the source of building 
            materials. 
            6. Fuel supply: Fuel is very essential to rural settlers for cooking and warmth when cold. In 
            most cases, settlements are around forest so that firewood is readily available. This is because 
            in early settlements and still in least economically developed areas, firewood was/is the main 
            fuel source. 
            7. Absence of diseases: Sites are sought for because of poor medical facilities and the principle 
            if prevention is better than cure. So disease prevalent areas as middle Belt in Nigeria (with 
            the tsetse fly) and the Volta valley in Ghana (river blindness) are abandoned because of fear 
            of sleeping sickness and blindness respectively. 
            8. Relief: Flat low lying lands as the Paris Basin and North German Plain are favoured. This is 
            because it is easy to build, better quality soils exist and there is greater water availability as 
            
            
            opposed to steeper and higher ground as the Alps regions of France, Germany, Italy and 
            Switzerland. 
            9. Resources: Areas with access to specific resources such as salt (Nantwich and Cheshire in 
            England and Ejagham villages on the salt lake of Ejagham in Manyu division of the 
            Southwest region of Cameroon), iron ore and coal. 
            b. Human factors 
            1. Politically: To secure gained land. This is the case of Israeli settlements in West Bank and 
            extension of Cameroonian settlement in Bakassi area. Also, to ascertain balanced 
            development and change political capital as Brasilia in Brazil, Abuja in Nigeria, 
            Yamoussoukro in Ivory Coast (Cote D’ivoire). 
            2. Socially: These are to ensure decongestion as in the case of the British New Towns. This is 
            also the case of resettlement schemes as those after the Nyos disaster (Esu, Waindu, Kimbi 
            and Buabua). 
            3. Economically: This is basically for exploitation of resources. For example, Mini Matape, 
            Betare Oya in the Eastern region of Cameroon and the lumber village settlements in southern 
            Cameroon. 
            CONCEPT OF RURAL SETTLEMENT 
            Lesson 3: Rural Settlement 
            A) Meaning and types 
            i. Meaning: It is a small sized settlement that occupies the countryside and carries out 
            predominantly primary activities like agriculture, fishing, hunting, mining, lumbering, etc. It 
            can also be referred to as a place or traditional structure where a group of people live more or 
            less permanently close to their environment allowing them to share the problems of shelter, 
            defense, cultivation and services as well as to enjoy social activities.  
            ii. Types  
             Isolated dwelling: This is a type of rural settlement found in the middle of agricultural lands 
            where individual houses stand several kilometers apart from each other. They are also called 
            farmsteads and include farm or manor houses standing alone in the countryside used for the 
            storage of farm tools or surplus harvest as the case may be. Since they are isolated from each 
            
            
            other, they appear to be self-sufficient and are a result of economic necessity. They may 
            contain as many as 10 people. 
             Hamlets: They are smaller than villages and are made up of very few houses of about half a 
            dozen. In most cases such rural settlements are without a church and may have no school, 
            shop or other services. They usually have farms around them and the buildings materials are 
            precarious i.e. non-durable. They may include Fulani huts, Igloos, etc. 
             The village: This is a rural settlement with many houses than a hamlet and usually with a 
            school, church, small store, small postal agency, but may not have a municipal council. Its 
            population rages from 101 to 2000 people. Villages are subdivided based on tow principles 
            i.e. size (small with about 101 -500 people and large villages with about 501-2000people) 
            and land occupation (closed village and open village). 
            B) Size 
            i. Meaning: This is the area space occupied by either a village or a hamlet. i.e. the physical 
            size and it is measured in square kilometres, hectares or square miles. Using the statistical 
            approach, it can be referred to the number of people contained in a settlement. In this light 
            the number of inhabitants (the population size), it is common to get appellations as large 
            villages (501-2000 people), small villages (common in the tropics with 11 to 100 people) and 
            isolated farm dwellings (with 1 to 10 people). 
            ii. Factors influencing Rural settlement Size. 
            a. Natural or physical considerations/factors 
            1. Nature of terrain: In areas where the terrain is rugged, settlements are smaller in size. This 
            is because there is limited space to permit the growth of a continuous settlement. Settlements 
            will thus exist as isolated Bocages dotted at few level points such as plateau, saddles, etc. 
            Examples are the tiny villages on the chain of hills in the Kupe Manenguba and Lebialem 
            Divisions of the Southwest region of Cameroon. 
            2. Quality of soils: Rural settlements have often been called “agrarian workshops”. This is 
            because the bulk of the population in most of them is engaged in agriculture. Soil quality in 
            terms of its sustainability to agriculture is an important environment factor in settlement 
            growth. This explains why some of the largest villages as Hwang Ho, Yangtze-Kiang in 
            china. 
            3. Type of vegetation cover: The nature of the vegetation determines the ease with which 
            living space is created. In dense forest areas like the Congo and Amazon basins, villages are 
            
            
            smaller in size due to the difficult nature of clearing forest. But in grassland areas, villages 
            tend to be larger because it is easy to construct settlements. 
            b. Economic considerations/factors 
            1. Farming system: In areas where farming is intensive in nature, rural settlements are 
            generally larger. This is because this system of agriculture can support large populations. 
            This explains the large villages of Asia which are based on intensive rice culture (paddy). On 
            the other hand, areas where extensive farming is practiced, villages are always small in size 
            for example the Azande region of DRC. 
            2. Trade opportunities: Trade opportunities facilitate the development of settlements and so 
            villages endowed with trade opportunities tend to be large. This is the case of villages at river 
            crossing points. Also, many hitherto small villages have grown into large settlements due to 
            the coming of roads which have introduced trade opportunities. For example the Bamileke 
            villages in Cameroon traverse by trunk A roads, the numerous Bakundu villages on the 
            Kumba-Buea road, etc. 
            3. Degree of variety of functions: As the number of functions increase, the size of the village 
            also increases. This is because the employment structure is diverse and attracts many basic 
            workers. Also, the village starts to provide some higher order goods that require a large 
            threshold population and villages will have wider ranges. 
            4. Population density: Higher population densities reduce the settlement physical size of 
            villages. This is because the people are concentrated on a small area. This is the case of the 
            polders of Holland and Danish Archipelago of Denmark. On the other hand, low population 
            densities indicate spread of people over a wide area. This is the case of Lebialem division. 
            c. Political changes: Some villages may experience changes in administrative status and this 
            change changes its field or sphere of influence. The raising of the status of some villages to 
            sub divisional headquarters has attracted more people and resources. For example, Penka 
            Michel in the west region, Alou and Wabane in Lebialem division, Konye and Mbonge in the 
            Meme Division of the southwest region of Cameroon.  
            d. Social: This appears to be a very trivial factor but in most parts of Africa, cultural lineage 
            contributes in determining the settlement size. The aspect of cultural lineage becomes quite 
            significant if we recognize the clan as the nucleus of most villages today. 
            e. Technological level: The skills the people possess in utilizing their resources have a bearing 
            on the size of their village. For example in Sudan, those tribes which are more apt at growing 
            
            
            cassava and bananas and gathering food from the bush are concentrated together in greater 
            numbers than the other groups. 
            To conclude, it should be noted that villages are not static as they may rise and fall both in 
            population and area extent. Those which remain small have often suffered from either the 
            continued poverty of the surrounding land or their isolation from modern traffic routes. 
            Lesson 4: Settlement Morphology 
            A) Form: This refers to the nature and the arrangement of the buildings, the plot of land on 
            which they stand and the connecting tracks, roads and services. As such, the form of a rural 
            settlement goes beyond the mere notion of shape of the settlement. It equally embodies the 
            durability and pattern of rural settlement. It should be recalled here that all forms of rural 
            settlements are concerned with the continuing needs for food, drink, clothing, shelter from 
            the environment and the ease with which these necessities can be obtained will determine the 
            exact form taken by any rural settlement. This will depend on; the nature of the environment 
            (topography), historical background, cultural traits (habits of ethnic and racial groups), 
            economic status (system of farming/techniques), level of population, and the actual area size 
            exploited at any given time. 
            1. Unstable settlement: These are settlements whose occupancy of a space is very short or 
            those in which human habitation is not continuous. Thus, the existence and habitation of such 
            rural settlements is not permanent. They are also called temporary settlements. This is the 
            case of hunting and pastoral groups, primitive agriculturist (shifting cultivation) who have 
            essentially moveable dwellings. 
            2. Stable or permanent settlement: These are the rural settlements that occupy a site for quite 
            a long time and their disappearance is not very imminent. They allow for the development of 
            recognizable shapes, patterns and sizes. Most villages are stable and as time passes they 
            evolve and look even more permanent and their disappearance will result from mostly 
            external influences as war, natural disasters etc. they are of two types 
            a. Spontaneous: These are rural settlements which developed gradually and naturally with 
            economic growth and progress. The shapes and patterns were not considered at the moment 
            of choosing the site and after the careful choosing of site, other morphological characteristics 
            
            
            develop gradually and often by chance. This is the case of rural settlements (hamlets and 
            villages) attracted to certain natural factors like water, building material and fuels. 
            b. Planned rural settlements: These are rural settlements whose morphological (shape, size 
            and pattern) and other characteristics are deliberately designed as single units and built as 
            whole entities. Most of them are tend to be furnished with amenities like electricity, roads, 
            hospitals and schools. They have diverse shapes. 
            Reasons for planned settlement patterns 
             Economic reasons: Planned villages which are agriculture based offer an opportunity to an 
            individual to own farmland which is usually equitably distributed and as such, families are 
            assured an income. For example the Federal Land Development Authority Scheme in 
            Malaysia. 
             Social reasons:  They are out mostly to provide housing at lower cost. This is the case of 
            improved slums in Soweto South Africa, Rio de Janeiro Brazil, SIC estates in Cameroon. 
             Political reasons: They are constructed to consolidate political power. This is the case of 
            Batie villages in Cameroon in the 1970s to weaken the stronghold of the “maquisards”. 
            Advantages of planned settlement - To limit rural exodus as in them, the pull factors found in urban areas exist is the case of the 
            Ujamaa in Tanzania. - They improve on the environmental situation as allowance is given to them. - To relieve areas of overpopulation through resettling the dissatisfied peasants. - Increase productivity capacity of the village as well as increase the national income. 
            Disadvantages  - Social problems easily arise as the freedom of the people and their independence is 
            withdrawn due to the fact that they have to pay for houses, farms, water and electricity. - A risk of poor living conditions resulting unless serious planning is implemented to ensure 
            the maintenance of a certain number of people. - Inadequate housing, squatter centres or zones easily emerge as well as malnutrition. This is 
            because population soon surpasses resources and amenities. - Other social ills as gossiping, prostitution and stealing as people carry same activities and are 
            close to each other. 
            
            
            B) Shapes: It is an aspect of form and concerned with the arrangement of buildings, roads, and 
            farms within the different forms of villages. i.e. it involves consideration of the relationship 
            between one dwelling and another and the patterns formed by various arrangements of 
            houses and buildings. 
            Types of rural settlement shape 
            1. Compact or clustered villages: They are also called close-knit and forms nucleated pattern. 
            Here, the dwellings are in close proximity to each other and there is a fairly clear distinction 
            or separation between the settled areas and countryside or cultivated land. This reflects basic 
            characteristics like type of farming practiced (arable and intensive), people who founded it, 
            social dimensions and conditions under which it was originally established. 
            
            
            
            
            
            2. Loose – Knit or Scattered villages: They are also called spread or fragmented villages. 
            These are villages in which dwellings are distant from each other and they appear as a 
            scattering of individual farms are houses across an area. The buildings are however nearer 
            each other to be called isolated dwellings and their arrangement shows no nucleus or focal 
            point or evident interrelationship. Examples are found in the Batie area of the western region 
            of Cameroon. 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            3. Linear or Long villages: They are also called elongated, shoe-string, ribbon or street 
            settlements. Here, dwellings are strung side by side along both sides of a main line of 
            communication traversing the settlement or a narrow confined river valley, river terraces or 
            raised banks. Examples are found along the Kumba-Mamfe, Kumba-Ekondo Titi, Kumba
            Buea stretches of roads. 
            
            
            
            
            
            4. Doubled villages: These are compact villages which exist in two halves. This can be top and 
            bottom of a steep ridge or on opposite sides of a river. It can also occur on a beach and 
            another half on top of a sea cliff. They can have single names but at times, prefixes and 
            suffixes as lower and upper are added to qualify them. Example is Down town and Up station 
            Bamenda. 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            5. Cross-Road or Cruciform settlement: These are linear and/or compact settlements that 
            have adopted the shape created by converging routes or at an intersection of routes. They 
            exist in variety since the different route axes may join in an acute or right angle and have 
            different degrees of in filling between the roads. They can adopt either T and Y shaped, star 
            and cross shaped. 
            
            
            
            
            6. Open space villages: These are clustered rural settlements which have an open space at the 
            centre and the dwellings surround it. The open space is often occupied by a pond, church or 
            market. These open spaces can be rectangular, round or circular, square or triangular in 
            shape. The buildings normally face inward towards each other round the open space since the 
            dwelling form a ring round them, they have been given the name ring villages. 
            
            Factors influencing shapes of rural settlements 
            a. Nature of communication lines: Since lines give rise to linear or ribbon shapes but if cross 
            roads, they give rise to clustered, radial, star and cruciform, T and Y shapes depending on the 
            manner in which the routes axes intersect. 
            b. Nature of terrain: Broad plains give rise to circular shapes of settlement that would extend 
            out evenly in all directions to give compact or clustered forms. Conversely, in restricted 
            valleys and raised beaches on flood plains, linear shapes often result. 
            c. Physical obstacle: These include relief features and rivers. In areas of great physical 
            obstacles as rugged topography excess drainage, villages are irregular in shape. Also, loose
            knit occur as on Batie landscape in Cameroon. 
            d. Historical: This is the case of need for defense in such a case, open shapes are adopted. 
            e. Cultural: This considers the customs of the people. In areas of no close ties, no sense of 
            belonging together, loose-knit and isolated shapes appear. But where ties are close, compact 
            shapes result. 
            
            
            f. Available resources: In areas of scanty resource bases, shapes are isolated and loose-knit as 
            the resources cannot support a large population. But in areas of rich resource base, clustered 
            shapes result. 
            g. Government action: If government creates industries in an area clustered shapes occurs but 
            in areas without industries isolated and loose-knit occur. 
            To conclude, the variations in the shapes of villages are due therefore to an array of factors 
            grouped into geographical (relief rivers), historical (defense) economic (farming system) and 
            culture. All these have contributed in making some forms more regular than others. It should also 
            be noted that the different forms of villages could be indicated by the configuration of site i.e. the 
            availability of suitable sites. 
            Lesson 5: Settlement Distribution 
            A) Meaning: This is the nature of spread or spacing of settlements of any size across the 
            landscape (countryside). That is, where they are located and where they are not. In other 
            words it is indicated by the density of settlements and houses. It is measured as follows: 
            �
            �𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦=𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠
            𝑆𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑦 𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑝𝑦 
            B) Types and illustrations of Rural Settlement distribution. 
            1. Dense and sparse: In areas where land is fertile and float or gentle relief, with little 
            variations in physical conditions many dwellings exist leading to very dense or clustered and 
            regular settlement e.g. the South of Eastern slopes of Mount Cameroon. But in areas where 
            land is rugged and difficult, dwellings are few leading to very sparse settlements. 
            
            
            
            2. Clustered and Random: These are pockets of settlements common in areas of uneven 
            topography, where water is limited and fertile soils occurring sporadically (dotted).. it should 
            be noted that in areas of difficult environment and rugged relief, settlement distribution is 
            usually clustered and random as the settlement cluster in or congregate at better locations. 
            Examples are common in desert environments. 
            
            
            3. Linear clustered: These are compacted settlements common along boundaries (both human 
            and natural). Examples are numerous along Kumba-Buea road. 
            
            
            
            
            
            Measurement of Settlement Distribution Pattern (The Nearest Neighbour Analysis – Rn) 
            Devised by Clark and Evans who wished to describe patterns of plant (ecological) distribution, 
            this measure/technique was known then as the Mean Distance Nearest Neighbours. It has 
            however been adopted by geographers and has now become the most acceptable measure of 
            distribution patterns of rural settlement. In it sense, it a quantitative technique devised to provide 
            an objective description of settlement distribution patterns. 
            
            
            Assumptions. 
             Main assumption is that random distribution occurs and that the methods are only appropriate 
            where random variables have generated the distribution. 
             It also holds an isotopic plain i.e. settlements have the same sizes, small surface areas 
            involved, only settlements on the same point of a hierarchy (hamlet, village or town) 
            involved, and same threshold and range of functions. 
            Aim: It seeks to establish order in a seemingly disorganized spatial distribution of settlements. 
            It is represented using the following formula: 
            
            The numerical values of Rn ranges from zero (0) to 2.15 and their interpretations are as follows; 
             Rn value of zero (0) indicates complete clustering. This occurs when all dots are very close 
            to the same point. In reality values lie between 0 and 1. 
             Values 0.5 is the dividing line between random and clustering.  
             Values between 0.5 and 0 indicates tendency towards clustering while 0.5 to 1 is a tendency 
            towards random. 
             Rn values of 1 indicate complete randomness. This pattern shows no specific arrangement or 
            nature of spread. The reasons are linked to poor accessibility. 
             Rn values of 2.15 indicate a pure regular or perfectly uniform pattern of distribution and if 
            ever found in reality, each dot is equidistant from the neighbor. This is fostered by good 
            roads, communication and other facilities. 
             From 1.5 to 1, it is a tendency towards regularity. 
            
            
            Example 1: Study the following diagram which shows the hypothetical distribution of 
            settlements (and the distance from each other) over an area of 90km2. Calculate the Rn for the 
            area and interpret your results.

            It facilitates the comparison of characteristics of distribution of phenomena in different 
            regions or within regions, thereby enhancing spatial comparisons. 
            It forms a useful basis for further investigation into why any clustering, regularity or 
            randomness of settlement has taken place. 
            It gives a rough picture about settlement spacing over the landscape. 
            It is used to calculate or measure mathematically settlement distribution. 
            b. Limitations and problems of the Rn Index. 
            It is only a technique and does not offer any explanation of patterns. 
            It is highly theoretical and cannot operate in the real world because it simply compares 
            settlement distribution shown on a map with a random distribution taken as point of 
            reference. 
            Distortions are likely to occur in valleys where nearest neighbours are separated by rivers, 
            scarp slope. 
            It is often difficult to determine the centre of settlements for measurement purposes 
            especially if it has a linear or loose-knit morphology. 
            Settlement Patterns 
            Types of Rural settlement Patterns 
            Meaning: It refers to the spatial relationship between one dwelling and another in a settlement. 
            i.e. whether they are close together as in a village or far apart as in a hamlet or in an isolated 
            farmstead. In other words, it is the way or manner in  which particular types of settlements are 
            located in an area. 
            1. Nucleated, Clustered or Compact Pattern: It a rural settlement pattern in which dwellings 
            or groupings of several family residences are compact and close together. In order word it is 
            the tendency for settlements to have a compact or clustered form (nature). Unlike dispersion, 
            nucleation occurs both in rural and urban areas. the rural settlements which are of concern 
            here are; hamlets and villages. 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            2. Dispersed, Scattered or Loose-knit: This is a rural settlement in which houses are widely 
            spaced, isolated or less compact or far from each other. They are homesteads or one family 
            residence standing at least a 1km apart from the nearest neighbour and separated from one 
            another by open country or by geographical barriers. Dispersion is hence a tendency for 
            settlements to have scattered patterns. 
            
            
            
            
            3. Intercalated or Intercalatory Patterns: This is an intermediate pattern which is generally 
            regarded as a kind of dispersal. It is in reality a pattern mid-way between dispersion and 
            nucleation but with a greater tendency towards dispersal. Hence it is a less nucleated 
            settlement pattern made up of scattered hamlets. Here both nucleated and dispersed 
            settlements are found randomly existing together. 
            4. Planned Pattern: This is a pattern in which buildings are equidistant (equal distance apart). 
            It is therefore a regular or uniform pattern. This is the case of resettlement schemes, refugee 
            camps, plantation camps and dormitory villages in general. It has an Rn Index of around 2.5 
            Factor Favouring Nucleation (Nucleated Patterns)  
            1. Historical and cultural factors 
            a. Age of settlements: In new settlements, communities are pushed by the necessity of dealing 
            effectively with some hostile environment in order to stay together. This is due to the 
            benefits of social advantage as ease to obtain facilities such as education, medical care, etc. 
            
            
            This is common in forested areas as with the pygmies in the equatorial Africa and the Red 
            Indians of the Amazon.  
            b. Systems of Land Tenure: The manner of acquisition and utilization of land has evolved 
            throughout time. At certain points in history, it has evolved to favour nucleation. Communal 
            farming that was practiced under the open field systems of the medieval period for example, 
            resulted in nucleated patterns of settlements. This is because communal field labour was the 
            centre of daily activities. Hence people needed to live together and plan out the work, 
            control labour and security. Other sub factors here include; the inheritance system, defence 
            and security. 
            2. Nature of the physical landscape: In areas where terrain induces nodality (existence of 
            isolated favourable points), nucleation is the norm and villages tend to have strong nucleated 
            patterns. But in areas with accented relief (rugged topography), villages and hamlets cluster 
            around the few flat areas avoiding the steep slopes and narrow valleys. In such cases, villages 
            occupy flat areas and bowls (depressions) and people tend to concentrate their dwellings in 
            these nodal terrains. Again, rural settlements depend on their immediate environment for 
            building materials. Hence I areas where there is an abundance of building material nucleation 
            develops e.g. source of brick clay in South Wales in England. Other factors in line with this 
            include; scarcity and excess water, pattern of localized settlement potential as river crossing 
            point, exploitation of a point bound resource. 
            3. Nature of agriculture (Land Use Systems): Agricultural communities which have settled 
            firmly on soil have done so by preference and in most cases in the form of compact 
            settlement. It is therefore expected that this backbone activity of the rural economy will 
            strongly encourage nucleation. For example in areas of intensive farming, nucleated patterns 
            develop. This is due to the fact that land is scarce and farmers need to cluster together so as 
            to avoid land wastage like in North East polders of Holland. Nucleation is equally evident in 
            areas of arable farming since little land is needed for it activities and distance covered are not 
            too long. A good example of this is the nucleated villages among the arable farmers of 
            Foumbot in the Noun division of the west region of Cameroon. 
            4. Other factors: Among other factors which encourage nucleation, communication is one of 
            them. Transport and route ways have always had a major influence on the clustering of 
            dwellings as buildings tend to be grouped together at crossroads and “T” junctions, at 
            bridging points and along main roads. Again, in areas where communication and technology 
            
            
            are poor, people tend to live together. This is the cause of nucleation whether in a hamlet of a 
            village especially in developing countries. Government action can equally encourage 
            nucleation. 
            Factors Favouring Less Nucleated Rural Settlements 
            1. Sociological change: When a tradition of strong family, clannish or tribal ties (tradition 
            where children cluster around parents to work and obtain traditional way of life) becomes 
            weakened by the evolution of civilization, nucleation gives way to dispersion. The reverse 
            gives rise to less disperse settlement pattern. 
            2. Change in the land tenure system: When there is a breakdown in feudalism as well as the 
            case of the agrarian revolution that followed the medieval era in Europe, nucleation turns to 
            less nucleated patterns. In this case, peasants gained freedom as they moved away from the 
            estate of their former landlords. This was especially the case of Britain and Russia in the 
            medieval period. Nucleation gave way for dispersion. 
            3. Changes in the need for collective defence: When there is decline in the need for collective 
            defence due to general guarantee of security, dispersion takes over from nucleation. For 
            example, many African villages became dispersed with colonization simply because 
            colonization stamped out numerous inter-tribal wars, and brought stability in many parts of 
            Africa. This saw a decline in the cluster of villages on the Mandara Mountains of Far North 
            region of Cameroon. 
            4. Decline in point bound resources: When a point bound resource such a pockets of fertile 
            soils start experiencing decline in fertility, forest reserves and mineral deposits depleted, 
            there is an outward spread of settlement. This out movement in search of new resources 
            breaks up the nucleation leading to dispersion. This in some instances has been so severe that 
            “ghost” villages have been the end result. This can also result from drying up of lone or few 
            water points. 
            5. Changes in the agricultural system: When there is a change from arable to pastoral farming 
            type or intensive to extensive farming systems, which need large pieces of land, nucleation 
            breaks down in favour of dispersion. In Egypt, change from the old basin form of irrigation 
            to the perennial system, permitted peasants to own land. This saw the establishment of 
            dispersed farms from hitherto nucleated patterns. 
            
            
            Factors Favouring Dispersion or Dispersed Rural Settlement Patterns 
            1. Nature of the natural environment: Since the role of the physical milieu in the 
            establishment of dispersion is complex, it therefore warrants a careful analysis. In areas of 
            fertile level terrain, farmers are able to extend agriculture in any direction unlike in rugged 
            terrain where farming is limited to specific enclaves. For example, the dispersed settlement 
            patterns on the Benue, Diamare and Chad plains of northern Cameroon. It is however worth 
            noting that the more extreme the physical conditions and possible hardship of an area, the 
            more probable it is that settlements will be dispersed. This is mostly seen in highlands and 
            forest areas where agricultural opportunities are limited by difficult terrain, harsh climate and 
            barren soils. 
            2. Agricultural characteristics (land use systems): In areas of pastoral farming type, 
            settlements are highly dispersed. This is especially the case where pastoral nomadism and 
            transhumance are practiced since they favour the development of isolated dwellings. These 
            dispersed settlement patterns are typical of uplands suitable only to sheep rearing or 
            extensive cattle rearing as noticed with the Masai nomads in Kenya. Also, in areas of fertile 
            extensive farming systems, settlement patterns are dispersed. These are areas with generally 
            very large farms separated from distant one by use of fences (barbed wire hedge or sticks) 
            and with wind pumps supplying water. These farms are when well developed, are self
            sufficient and so allows farmers to live in isolation. This is the case of the extensive cereal 
            cultivation in the temperate grasslands as American prairies, veldt of south Africa. 
            3. Socio-cultural factors: This examines the ways of life of the people and how these people 
            have evolved overtime. This has come mainly as a result of improvement in individual space 
            (standard of living). And as civilization progressed, the need for co-operation declines and 
            people move out of villages to live on their own. Hence in areas where feudalism system is 
            absent of non-existent, there is no centrality around landlords. This is simply because the 
            land is fairly equitably distributed through free ownership of land. This brings in the spirit of 
            individuality which favours dispersion. Also, the customs and belief of some people favours 
            dispersion for example, the pygmies of the central African region (Congo, Zaire and 
            Cameroon) are a wandering tribe that moves from place to place in search of wild nuts and 
            game. As a result, most settlements within the equatorial forest zone of central Africa are 
            dispersed. 
            
            
            To conclude, in many parts of the world, mere pressure of population has caused villages to 
            break up and begin to scatter. This is due to the accepted belief that scattered settlements lead to 
            more intensive production and any innovation of agriculture must be preceded by a break-away 
            from communal practices of which compact settlement was the symbol.

            Nearest Neighbour Analysis Index) 
             Meaning, formula, interpretation scale, importance and limitations of the technique, 
            application with concrete examples calculated. 
            Lesson 6: Immediate Physical Environment 
            As observed above, many factors favour rural settlement siting or establishment. Since rural 
            settlements have low level of technical knowledge, they generally adapt rather than modify the 
            natural characteristics of the milieu. Hence it has become necessary to examine the extent to 
            which certain characteristics of rural settlement reflect an adaptation to the immediate physical 
            conditions. A critical examination is seen below. 
            a. Form of village or settlement: The shape taken by any village on the landscape is largely 
            dependent on the micro-relief of the site. In lowland areas liable to flooding for example, 
            villages will cluster on a levee, a small hillock or a raised terrace. In highland areas with 
            accidented relief, settlements are located to avoid excessively steep mountain slopes and thin 
            often dry soils. Villages are thus constructed on river valleys where flat and fertile land might 
            be obtained. These valley villages tend to linear in form. Again, in a ridge and furrow 
            landscape, hill top villages arise. This is because ridges have resistant rocks that provide firm 
            building ground. These forms of settlements tend to be double.  
            b. Styles of houses: In settlements, houses are built to withstand various environmental stresses 
            which include climatic extremes, minor tectonic activities, etc. This is reflected either in the 
            nature of roofing, heights of building, building materials. In most areas of the world, the 
            shapes of roofs for example are designed to adapt to expected average rainfall amounts. i.e. 
            in very wet areas like the equatorial and humid tropics, steeply pitched or symmetrical roofs 
            are the norms as they are considered to be an effective means of shedding off the excess rain 
            water than the gently inclined roofs. The heights of buildings also are designed in rural areas 
            
            
            to withstand winds and stormy gales. In hill top villages for example, houses are dwarf 
            (short). This is because the wind speed increases with height and also hilltops are exposed. 
            Examples are common in the Mandara Mountains of North Cameroon. 
            c. Occupation: The daily activities of rural areas have always been related to what the natural 
            environment offers. This is because the level of technology is low and processing and service 
            industries largely absent. Traditionally, rural areas have been called agrarian workshop and 
            the agricultural activity undertaken is shaped by the physical environment. In level terrain for 
            example, arable farming (cultivation of crops) is practiced and is often intensive in nature. 
            This is because of the presence of thick often fertile soils. In hilly areas, pastoral farming 
            (rearing of animals) is practiced and this is often extensive in nature. Again, villages located 
            along river courses have fishing as their main occupation and those in forested areas add 
            hunting to their list of occupations. 
            To conclude, the analysis of form, housing conditions and occupation in rural areas, shows that 
            the role of the physical environment on these aspects of the rural settlement is diminishing with 
            time. This is due to the trickling down into the rural areas improved technology and the general 
            changing perception of the rural man. Also, these aspects of the rural settlement have never been 
            influenced by the physical milieu alone but also by economic, socio-cultural and defence 
            considerations. 
            Lesson 7: Urban Fringes 
            A. Meaning: Rural-Urban fringe (R-U fringe) is a transitional zone and could be recognized 
            recently on social grounds by the presence of rural and urban groups. But modern means of 
            communications as well as means of movement of people and goods are making the social 
            attitudes between the two groups of rural and urban practically much diffused.  
            Herington defines rural-urban fringe more or less in the same context as “an area with distinctive 
            characteristics which is still partly rural and where many of the residents live in the country but 
            are not socially and economically of it”. In other words, it can be described as the “landscape 
            interface between town and countryside” or as the transition zone where urban and rural uses 
            mix and often clash. Still in line with this, in 1951, an American land economist H.M Meyer for 
            the first time defined rural-urban fringe as “the transition zone between the city and rural 
            agriculture area where a mixed land use pattern having both rural and urban practices are 
            
            
            located”.  This zone is also called “out urban area” or “peripheral zone” or “Rural-Urban 
            Continuum”. This is illustrated on the diagram below. 
            
            B. Characteristics of Rural-Urban Fringes 
             Land Use Characteristics 
             There is constantly changing pattern of land use 
             Residential expansion is rapid 
             Farms are small with intensive crop production 
             Service and other public facilities are inadequate 
             Science and business [arks development 
             Airport expansion 
             Speculative building is common 
             Social characteristics 
             Segregation: Rural urban fringe also known as “Greenfield site” (undeveloped sites 
            outside the existing built up urban area) which are favoured by large firms seeking 
            locations for new developments such as headquarters, offices, housing and industrial 
            estates. So there is functional segregation of land use. 
            
            
             Selective immigration: The rural urban fringe attracts middle class residents who form a 
            small but powerful and economically important proportion of the city population. Service 
            and other public facilities are inadequate in fringe region which lead to immigration. 
             Commuting: People living in fringe area commute daily to their place of work. This 
            creates the dual problem of traffic congestion in the city, the city government is faced with 
            the task of providing transport service handling peak load. 
            C. Challenges of Rural-Urban Fringes - Unplanned and haphazard growth - Urban garbage and the dumping ground of city with land pollution and underground 
            pollution. - Crematorium, sewage treatment plants - Slums and associated problems - The fringe area suffers concentration of land ownership, speculation on land and rapidly 
            rising land values. - Polluting industries are shifted to fringe areas - Crime and vandalism due to interaction of two interacting cultures since, urban 
            temperament differs from rural. - Social psychological changes and social alignments are happening. Beliefs are broken 
            and there are more disruptions in societies and families. - Lack of water supplies, no public sewage disposal, unplanned streets. - Outside the municipality limits, small towns and revenue villages lack administrative and 
            financial infrastructures. - The fringes are served by poor public transport facilities.  
            Lesson 8: Differences between rural and urban settlements 
            In theory, the classification of settlements into rural and urban is easily made but in 
            practice on the landscape, it is difficult to bring out what is rural and what is urban. This is much 
            so because the two types gradually merge into one another at certain points (the rural-urban 
            fringe and the spread of the “suburbia”). 
            
            
            Although a universal standard for distinguishing rural from urban settlements is still to be arrived 
            at, a number of parameters have been laid down which help simplify the complex issue of rural
            urban dichotomy. They include; 
            1. Demographic characteristics: This criterion examines the aspects of the population such as 
            population size, densities and age structure and their implications on the growth rate, 
            mobility and occupations. 
            a. Population size: There is no universally accepted population size used as a demarcation 
            between rural and urban settlements. This is because the minimum population for urban 
            settlements varies between state. But for international evaluation, the European conference 
            on statistics held in Prague recommended that a nucleus of people living in compact groups 
            of at least 2,000 should be considered urban. As such countries have adopted this criterion. 
            b. Population density: This is the number of inhabitants per square kilometer of land. There is 
            a great relationship between the type of settlement and the way in which people are clustered 
            together. Generally, population densities are higher in towns than in rural areas. this reaches 
            a marked level in the developing countries where there is a swing of people to cities. In some 
            areas of Southeast Asia, urban population exceeds 5,000 people per square kilometer. In 
            these population nuclei, the population densities of rural areas is high but not as that of their 
            urban areas. 
            c. Population structure: The composition of the population varies greatly between urban and 
            rural areas. This is mainly in terms of age grouping and its implications. The urban areas are 
            characterized by a higher adult population or the economically active (18 to 65 years) or 
            those above secondary school age. This is due to the fact that these are those who easily 
            move into towns from surrounding rural areas. Conversely, in rural areas there is a high 
            proportion of children (below 15years) and the aged (above 65years). As a result of this age 
            composition, the rural areas have a high dependency ratio than the urban areas. Birth rate, 
            natural increase and population growth rate in general is high in urban areas than in urban 
            areas. 
            2. Sociological characteristics or traits: This examines the differences in the human behavior 
            in the rural society and the urban set up. 
            a. The way of life: One basis is contrasting life (economic, sociological and other geographical 
            aspects) in a rural community with living in a city. The main approach used has been a 
            
            
            sociological one which views a rural community as being characterised by everyday 
            neighbouring contact and accepted order of society, while an urban community as one 
            characterized by impersonalized urban living where status depends on achievement rather 
            than inheritance.  
            b. The standard of living: In urban areas, it is generally higher than that in rural areas. The 
            social amenities in urban areas are those that reflect luxury and greater face pleasure as film 
            halls, hotels, night clubs, chicken parlors, stadiums and telephones. As such, they enjoy 
            sophisticated services of recreation, health and education than the country sides. However, 
            there a few country sides which possess some these characteristics like the case of Bambili 
            and Bambui villages in the Tubah Division of the Northwest region of Cameroon with 
            university education facilities. 
            c. Sharp differences in their human aspects: Urban areas have numerous and diverse groups 
            of people living in close proximity, sharing the same social facilities yet lacking strong social 
            contacts. Individual anonymity is often a feature, together with human mobility, social 
            instability, complex class structure, wide variations in human wealth and heterogeneous ways 
            of life. As such, urban areas are often considered more social than economic units contrary to 
            the rural society where groups of people live in close contact and share jointly the problems 
            of shelter, defence, cultivation and services as well as enjoy social activities. 
            3. Morphological characteristics: This examines the following aspects 
            a. The physical size of the settlement: Rural settlements are quite smaller than the urban. For 
            example, the cities of Douala and Yaounde that have surface areas of about a hundred square 
            kilometres each as opposed to villages as Bakanki and Batie with only a few square 
            kilometres as surface areas. it should however be mentioned that some Chinese and Indian 
            villages are larger than some specialist towns. 
            b. Influence of site and situation: Rural settlements are influenced more by site while urban 
            settlements reflect more the situation. This is because in most rural settlements technology is 
            low and activities are adapted to the milieu. This is seen as most rural settlements are found 
            at vantage points as hilltops (Mediterranean villages), river valleys and areas of fertile soils. 
            4. Land use style: Significant differences are noticed in this domain. In the rural areas, 
            construction is largely horizontal whereas in urban areas due to limited space, it is 
            significantly vertical. Even though most rural areas possess story buildings these are not a 
            common feature of the architectural landscape as is the case in urban areas where sky 
            
            
            scrapping buildings are almost everywhere. Another dimension is the type and quality of 
            building materials used. Buildings in rural areas use local materials (grass, sticks, mud, etc.). 
            Conversely, in the urban areas exotic materials are mostly used. 
            5. Functions: Functions are services offered by settlements to their inhabitants and those 
            outside. In the function criterion, the main activities of the settlement are considered. With 
            regards to this, two views have been developed; the first view holds that there is a sharp 
            dichotomy (contrast) between the functions of urban and rural areas. this indicates that the 
            urban areas perform completely different functions from their rural counterparts. The second 
            view holds that the urban and rural areas carry out the same functions but the difference lies 
            in the numbers in both settlements. It considers that the urban settlements have a greater 
            number and diversity of functions which are also found in the rural areas.  
            To conclude, in analyzing the rural settlement has established that the overall consequence of 
            changes on the landscape has made rural settlements to become increasingly urban in thinking 
            and outlook. It therefore becomes necessary at this juncture to investigate into what the urban 
            settlement is all about. 
            TOPIC: CONCEPT OF URBAN SETTLEMENT 
            Lesson 9: The Concept of Urban Settlement 
            A. Meaning: Although it is clearly known that towns exists and that people live in them and 
            also that urban population differs from rural population in terms of distributions, densities, 
            way of life, structure and growth, people have been unable to come out with an acceptable 
            definition of an urban area. This difficulty is to the extent that it has often been said that the 
            town defies simple definition. They are distinguished generally however as an area 
            possessing characteristics different from those of rural areas. This has given towns distinct 
            physical, economic and social characteristics. 
            According to Fredrich Ratzel and urban geographer, he defines a city as “a continuous and 
            dense agglomeration of people and dwelling occupying a large area of ground lying at the focus 
            of a great trade route”. Another definition holds that “the town is a form of dwelling place in 
            which the majority of residents carryout their activities within the built-up area”. Again, a town 
            
            
            can be considered as an area characterized by the preponderance and concentration of all kind of 
            work connected with industry and trade but not agriculture. 
            Urban settlements therefore have compact buildings in a concentrated area and are classified 
            according to their history, size and functions. All these are summed up in the view of Johnson 
            R.J who says “Each urban place is a very dense concentration of people and homes, plus their 
            attendant’s work places, centres of trade, ente4rtainment and recreation and the many facilities 
            and utilities needed to serve all these” spatial structures. 
            B. Classification into types 
            Since towns vary greatly in terms of age, size, layout, function and population characteristics, 
            much effort has been made by geographers to place order in the variety of urban types by 
            attempting to classify towns and cities. The criteria put in use vary from simple population 
            size to types of geographical sites. Here, seven main approaches are usually adopted for 
            census and statistical records with each having a certain degree of weakness. 
            a. Staitistical approach: his uses the population size and some countries simply adopt a certain 
            minimum of population size for settlement agglomerations. On the basis of this the towns are 
            classified into the following categories 
            Population size Level of settlement  
            2001 – 10,000 Small town 
            10,001 – 100,000 Large town 
            100,001 – 1000,000 City 
            1000,001 – 10,000,000 Conurbation 
            Over 10,000,000 Megalopolis  
            Table 1: Categories of towns by population size 
            Source: Adapted from Whynne, 1985:185 
            This measure is very inaccurate because of; - In the LECs many towns appear so by size but resemble a village in character as they house 
            largely agricultural populations while in the MEDCs, many small size settlements though 
            appearing as villages in size have all that make a settlement urban in character. - Urbanization studies are based on census data and as such, comparative studies are difficult 
            because there is no standard definition or urban. - Specific urban characteristics such as a central place district and residential zones 
            
            
            b. Function or occupational structure criterion: This criterion uses the proportion of the 
            population employed in non-agricultural occupations and dominant functions. Here, groups 
            of towns with similar functional characteristics may be identified by the analysis of 
            employment or occupation and specialization is said to exist when employment in a 
            particular category exceeds some “normal level”. This is however a quantitative index 
            because only adjectives are used to describe settlement, with no statistical basis. This 
            criterion classifies towns into industrial, commercial, cultural, fishing etc. i.e. using the 
            dominant activity in the settlement. 
            c. Administrative criterion: This method uses two basic principles in an attempt to classify 
            urban areas. they include; 
             Administrative centre criterion: Using this criterion, any administrative centre is labeled an 
            urban area. This is mostly used in countries like Honduras, Brazil, Peru, Egypt, and 
            Cameroon. In Cameroon, the headquarters of any administrative unit from subdivision 
            upwards is considered as a town. This uses the building and services found in each place. It is 
            also a subjective criterion and is limited in scope as it is used mostly in the less developed 
            countries. 
             Administrative division criterion: This one classifies the population of divisions into urban 
            or rural on the basis of selected criteria. There is the use of the total number of inhabitants of 
            the minor administrative divisions. This is used widely in continental Europe particularly in 
            Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, and Spain. There is equally the size 
            of the principal cluster of minor administrative division. This is used in France, Luxembourg 
            and Greece. This is limited in scope as it is only in use in LEDCs. 
            d.  Structural morphology criterion: This criterion uses building types and materials, streets, 
            compactness of buildings and the overall shape such as linear, nuclear, rectangular, star shape 
            etc. 
            e. Time of origin criterion: This criterion classifies towns into; medieval, pre-colonial, 
            colonial, industrial and post-industrial. The main flaw of these criteria is that they lack 
            universality, are arbitrary and suffer from oversimplification of reality. 
            f. Age of settlement criterion: This is a popular criterion that has attracted many people 
            interested in urban studies. In the development of this criterion, two views about urban areas 
            have been elaborated upon. There is the school of thought championed by J.M. Houston and 
            
            
            Griffith Taylor that considers towns as physical entities; and that of Lewes Mumford that 
            views it rather as a social entity. 
            Lesson 10: Urbanisation  
            A. Meaning of urbanization 
            As many other concepts in geographer there is no universal consensus as to what is an urban are. 
            As such the definition of the concept of urbanization is fraught with numerous short comings. 
            This is to the extent that no single working definition has been agreed upon. Some of the used 
            definitions are: 
             The process whereby an increasing proportion of the population of a given geographical area 
            (world, region or nation) lives in urban areas or settlement. 
             It is the proportion of the total population of an area living in an urban area or it is the 
            number of people in an area living in an urban area. 
             It is the growth in the proportion of the total population in an area living in urban centres. 
             It is the continuous growth in size and number of urban settlements. 
            As a consequence of these short comings and confusion, a more comprehensive definition of 
            urbanisation has been advanced as “an increase in the proportion or number of people living in 
            towns and cities; and the land area occupied by urban centres”.  
            It should be noted here that urbanization is one of the most significant geographical phenomena 
            of this century to the extent that it has been described as a phenomenal process. This process 
            occurs whenever the urban population is growing more rapidly than the population as a whole. 
            B. Brief history of urbanization. 
            Settlements must be dynamic if they have to persist. This dynamism is not only related to why 
            rural settlements are founded but also to elements that make some settlements change from 
            hamlets to market towns and to major cities. Although why and when first towns were built is 
            not well known, studies have shown that this evolution over the years proceeded through well
            defined stages which are generally placed into three major phases which equally have minor 
            phases (pre-historic, medieval, pre-industrial, modern, colonial and planed towns). 
            
            
            1. The first cities or pre-historic towns (Before 1750): Urban life is dated some 5000 years 
            before the modern times. This was characterized by the advent of man changing from 
            scattered wandering groups into settled society life. The motivations and processes involved 
            in the establishment of these very first towns is largely a matter of speculation. As such, it is 
            believed that that the first time urban settlements were built was during the Neolithic 
            Revolution (around 8000BC).  This was the period of improvement in agriculture to the 
            extent that there was the existence of a prosperous settled agriculture. Thus, the growth of 
            towns can be linked to innovation in agriculture. 
            The middle Ages or medieval era saw the re-awakening of urban growth. This restarted so 
            vigorously that geographers describe it as the medieval revival. From the 11th century onwards, 
            there was the resurgence and spread of trade, new industries and crafts developed and population 
            grew. During this era, the number of urban settlements increased and there was the emergence of 
            great cities today like Amsterdam, Venice, Paris and London. This age also saw the dawn of 
            urban life in the new world following voyages of exploration that extended the limits of the 
            known world. Medieval towns are classified into three; religious or episcopal (Rome, Kush 
            (Ethiopia) and Mecca), commercial or trader towns (London, Rotterdam, Paris), the Bourgs 
            (Strasbourg, Pittsburg and Edinburgh). 
            2. The urban industrial revolution (1750 to 1950): The history of urbanization reveals that 
            rapid urbanization has occurred twice in time and space. This first was in the 19th century 
            following the agrarian and industrial revolutions which was limited to the now economically 
            developed countries. Thus, it is economic development that provoked this rapid urbanization. 
            The second appeared after WW II. The 18th and 19th centuries therefore saw the greatest 
            extension and expansion of urban settlements in world history of urban development. This 
            was the period of the industrial revolution when industrialization and urbanization proceeded 
            together. This period saw the transformation of the town characteristics, increase speed of 
            town growth and increase sizes of towns. 
            3. Post Industrial Revolution Urbanisation (After 1950): This second rapid phase started 
            from 1945 but gathered momentum since 1050s. In recent history, the change from industrial 
            capitalism to monopoly capitalism has marked the next principal stages in the urban 
            revolution. This transition was characterized by: - A much greater scale of economic activity  
            - - 
            The consolidation of firms  into multinational corporations 
            The domination of newly created international markets by a smaller number of producers in 
            each sector. 
            The mass production of a very much wider range of gods and services than previously 
            The ruthless exploitation of peripheral areas. - - 
            This is the phase at which developing countries experienced their turn and thus urbanization in 
            the LEDCs entered the stage of world urbanization. This resulted from the high natural increase 
            of the population and mass rural exodus and has resulted in the uncontrolled growth of many 
            cities in the developing world. In most of the LEDCs, urban growth was limited to population 
            concentrations around supply points of raw materials for the wealthy core. At the start of this 
            recent phase of urban development, 27% of the world population lived in towns and cities. 
            Majority of the urbanites were however in the MEDCs. I recent decades the growth of urban 
            settlements has continued at a very high rate in many parts of the world. New towns are being 
            created and large cities are becoming gigantic. An interesting feature of recent urbanization is the 
            increase in the number of “million” cities. 
            Since the 1980’s the following new tendencies have been noticed in world urbanization - - - - - 
            The fastest growing cities are in Latin America and the Japan-Korea region 
            Most of the fastest growing cities are located in the LEDCs with cities in the least developed 
            countries having the greatest increase. 
            The rate of growth in most of the LEDCs was less rapid than had been previously predicted. 
            Cities in North America and Western Europe are showing a decrease in overall size. This 
            process is called counter-urbanisation. 
            The developing world is characterized by over-urbanisation. This is the tendency where 
            migrants are driven from rural areas to large cities where slow economic growth does not 
            allow for the provision of sufficient jobs or shelter. 
            One conspicuous feature of this epoch is the disparity in the rates and trends or urbanization 
            between the LEDCs and the MEDCs. 
            
            
            C. Differences in rates of urbanization between MEDCs and LEDCs 
            The disparity in the rates of urbanization trends in the developed and developing countries is 
            clearly seen if their urban-rural population ratios are compared. In 1990 the UN estimated stated 
            that 73% of the people lived in urban areas in the MEDCs while cities in the LEDCs housed just 
            37%. The projection for year 2020 reveals that the population of urbanites in the MEDCs will 
            rise to 77% while in the LEDCs it will rise to 53%. This indicates that the rate of urbanization 
            would be more rapid in the LEDCs than in the MEDCs. The UN expects that between 1990 and 
            2025, the number of urban dwellers would double to more than five billion people, with 90% of 
            the growth to come from the LEDCs. This dichotomy is exposed by the following comparative - Unlike the case of the developed countries where the process is an integral part of 
            development, in the developing, it is a consequence of population growth and movement 
            (social conditions). - In other areas of MEDCs, urban growth is dispersed as numerous different centre experience 
            growth rate at the same time in a country. On the contrary, newly urbanized areas as Africa 
            and South America have urban growth concentrated in particular centres. As such only a few 
            large cities are emerging and growing at astronomical rates to the extent that the fastest 
            growing cities are mainly in these regions. For example Douala and Yaoundé in Cameroon. - The rate of urbanization varies from country to country. In the MEDCs urbanization has 
            slowed down but at a high level while in the LEDCs, urbanization is beginning to accelerate.  
            
            
            
            
            Figure: Rates of urbanization since 1950 
            In the past, present day MEDCs experienced the fastest rate of urban growth and the greatest 
            rural depopulation. This is to the extent that today about 70% of their population is urban. In the 
            MEDCs especially in countries like Britain, Germany, USA, urban growth is about constant. 
            This is because rural exodus almost balances with return migration. Today’s LEDCs have a 
            reversed trend as they had slow rates of urbanization in the past and in some regions it was non
            existent until fairly recently. The rate of urbanization is accelerating in LEDCs now because 
            most view it as a means towards development and the consequence has been great urban growth. 
            Still in the LEDCs, the rate of urban growth outpaced economic development in the 20th century, 
            thereby creating great problems to planners and politicians. This faster rate of urban growth in 
            the LEDCs than in the MEDCs has been described as “urban explosion”. 
            D. Causes of Urbanization or Urban Growth 
            1. Natural population growth: Urban areas constitute agglomerations of population and each 
            succeeding generation, the concentrations have become greater by natural increase. This 
            growth has thus become naturally self-sustaining. This is because birth rates are often higher 
            in urban areas than rural areas based on the fact that immigrants are usually of the fertile age 
            and partly because the greater wealth of towns makes large families more viable. Rural areas 
            on the other hand have higher death rates due to diseases, unreliable food supply, famine, 
            decreased standard of living vis-à-vis urban areas, etc. This was the main factor in rapid 
            
            
            urbanization in the MEDCs and today it remains a great contributing factor to urban growth 
            in the LEDCs. This trend is very noticeable in the early stages of urbanization as young 
            people drift from rural areas to urban in search of better livelihood. 
            2. In migration: In recent years, many towns have experienced a rapid population increase due 
            to mass exodus from the countryside into them for several reasons. Towns constantly gain 
            population through people drifting into towns at a rate that far exceeds that which people 
            move out from them. Based on this, the push-pull model has been designed to explain this 
            force underlying urbanization. This is an explanatory model of population movement into 
            cities which migration is seen to be the result of two set of forces whose effects are 
            complementary. They include 
            a. Agricultural changes: This comes from both improvements and declines. As a mark of 
            increased standards, farm mechanization may reduce the need for labour and this releases 
            farm labour for work in industry and increased food supplies sustain a larger non-agricultural 
            percentage of the population. This was the case of Europe in the 19th century. Also, decline in 
            agriculture enhances the drifting to towns as scarcity of fertile arable land causes masses to 
            drift to towns. For example the mass exodus of young adults and peasants from Santchou and 
            Nkongsamba region to Douala due to the collapse of the coffee trade, Western Highland to 
            Douala due to decline in soil fertility and overcrowding on farmland. 
            b. Industrialization: The great dependence of manufacturing activities on raw materials and 
            power supplies which are sporadic in distribution, leads to the clustering of factories in 
            relatively few locations. These large industrial complexes establish numerous advantages that 
            unsure their growth which becomes a pull on people since large-scale output requires large 
            amount of labour. This explains why rapid industrialization of LEDCs since the 1960s 
            especially through the growing influence of the MNCs has been held as a contributory factor 
            to their rapid rates of urbanization simply because most industrial complexes are urban 
            based. 
            c. Increased service activities: Tertiary and quaternary industries grow because of increased 
            trade, higher standards of living and the need for greater economic and social organization. 
            Many services (retailing, entertainment, catering and administration) by their nature tend to 
            be centralized in towns. These require space and so cause the physical expansion of towns 
            and the many people that follow these services to towns raise their population sizes. 
            
            
            d. Educational factor: Many aspects of education will influence urban growth. As people 
            become more knowledgeable, their ambitions grow. Towns are seen as centres where 
            opportunities abound and success is more attainable. Years ago, ignorance of towns would 
            have preserved much personal contentment in the countryside. This is much more today in 
            the LEDCs where their high attachment to more general education, qualifies increasing 
            numbers of people for town-based employment. Thus raising educational standards may alter 
            peoples’ aspirations, and cause them to move to urban areas. As such, many drift from rural 
            areas into towns to further their educational career on completion of elementary schools. 
            e. Government policy: The investment policies of central governments that favour urban areas 
            at the detriment of rural counterparts fuel the tide of rural exodus. This is very prominent in 
            the LEDCs where due to limited resources and in an attempt to enhance their prestige on the 
            inte3rnational scene, a large proportion of development resources are concentrated in urban 
            areas. This has sucked the rural population and pumped it into the urban areas. This result has 
            been that the latter has grown exponentially at the detriment of the former. 
            3. Immigration: Many towns especially in areas of extreme contrasts in the development of 
            neighbouring countries have witnessed population swelling from immigrants from other 
            countries. This is the case of influx of Chinese migrants into Japanese cities and Mexicans 
            into the towns and cities of Southwest USA. 
            E. Advantages or positive consequences of Urbanisation 
            1. Higher living standards: This is particularly as the rapid expansion of towns has speeded 
            the rate of development of basic social facilities to cater for the burgeoning population. Thus 
            around many urban centres modern sports complexes, hospitals, universities and colleges, 
            cinemas and theatres, efficient electricity and pipe-borne water systems, telecommunication 
            infrastructure and housing programmes have been developed. Also the growing employment 
            in industry and services provides higher incomes than in agriculture. This has boosted the 
            quantity and quality of goods and services consumed. 
            2. Promotion of cultural activities: The birth and acceleration of urban life stimulated and 
            encouraged cultural aspects as arts, literature, music and philosophy. These thrive or flourish 
            due to the accumulation of wealth which people are willing to spend on leisure and 
            entertainment activities. This is the main germ behind the development of a category of 
            towns called cultural towns. 
            
            
            3. Economic and material progress: This has come from several aspects such as: the rapid 
            urbanisation has almost everywhere been accompanied by a certain degree of growth in 
            industrialization, trade and service. These developments have generated numerous new jobs 
            in these sectors to cater for the large pool of able hands. Also, the growth of more efficient 
            and specialized services in the global economy is closely associated with accelerated 
            urbanization. 
            4. Transport network development: the ever increasing volume of urban route and pedestrian 
            traffic has necessitated the constant improvement of urban transport systems to accommodate 
            it. The rise of motorways, flyovers, underground routes and urban water causeways owe their 
            proliferation primarily to rapid urbanization. 
            F. Negative Effects (Urban Problems) 
            a. Physical problems 
            1. Lack of space for expansion: Outward growth (areal expansion) of the town’s limit results 
            from over construction of houses which for the most part are scattered. Space becomes scarce 
            for expanding former buildings or constructing new ones. The solution may be upward 
            growth which may be detrimental to urban living as it causes local wind eddies, shadows in 
            streets and other social problems. 
            2. Inadequate urban route infrastructure and traffic congestion: The millions of inhabitants 
            in the cities, who have to live, work and move about, invariably suffer from congestion on 
            roads. There is overcrowding of few streets by pedestrians, vehicles and cyclists, all 
            struggling to go before others. Thus all kind of conveyances, cars, buses, trams, trucks, 
            railways, motorcycles and bicycles, jam the network and slow down movement. This 
            congestion therefore causes frustration and delay during rush hours especially in old towns 
            with narrow streets. 
            3. Building decay: Industrial and residential buildings in towns are often obsolete and decayed. 
            Some are because they are old; others due to poor buildings. As a result of inner city 
            congestion, they are dilapidated and are characterized by “twilight zones” (i.e. zones with 
            numerous slums, poor social services and high crime rates. They are often the oldest parts of 
            the city-inner city, old industrial areas and derelict docklands). 
            4. Urban Sprawl: Urbanisation everywhere is marked by upwards growth (building of steel 
            framed sky scrapers) and the outward spread of the city. Meanwhile upward expansion is 
            characteristic of the centres of most cities, the outward spread of cities has had the greatest 
            
            
            effect on people and the landscape. This has been termed urban sprawl which is defined as 
            “the physical pattern of low density expansion of urban areas under market conditions into 
            surrounding agricultural areas or it is the expansion of a town over vast area through 
            uncontrolled spread of houses at urban fringe. 
            b. Environmental Problem 
            1. Pollution: Since urban areas are great waste producers, all sorts of harmful disposals to the 
            surrounding are common in rapidly growing towns. Since urban areas have a great presence 
            of many industries and houses, air and water pollution are common features. 
            2. Destruction of Green Belt: Urban sprawl and overspill population goes to the periphery and 
            destroys reserved urban land meant for beauty and recreation facilities as sporting grounds 
            and sightseeing or picnics. Thus with a rapid increase in urban sprawl, the natural beauty of 
            the landscape is spoilt as Greenfields sites have increasingly given way to housing and 
            industry. 
            3. Effects of environmental hazards:  As a result of overcrowded areas, encroachment of 
            settlement onto unsuitable areas (steep slopes, river valleys) and poor waste disposals, the 
            incidence of natural disasters is quite elevated. This has been seen in recurrent floods and 
            their consequences in the Yaounde city centre, Limbe and Bamenda in Cameroon. 
            c. Economic problems 
            1. High rates of unemployment: the main economic defect of urbanization is the tendency of 
            unemployment and underemployment. This is because large population of the rapidly rising 
            towns now outweighs the available jobs yet young adults continue streaming in. In the 
            MEDCs especially Britain, urbanization was accompanied by industrialization and so job 
            creation kept pace with urban population growth. In the LEDCs however, the two processes 
            are occurring at the same time. Unfortunately, urbanization has been more successful and so 
            the expected job creation from industry has not occurred. 
            2. Rising cost of living: The general cost of living is rising due to higher housing rents and 
            rising cost of food as the supply is inadequate to feed the growing number of mouths. 
            3. Huge economic burden: It requires huge human and financial resources to manage large 
            cities. This has resulted in enormous strain o the human and financial resources of such 
            countries. For example about £25 billion is needed each year to sustain productivity and to 
            moderately improve on the quality of life in Asia’s megacities alone. The main reason why 
            most megacities in the LEDCs have very appalling conditions is the huge resources needed. 
            
            
            d. Social ills or Problems 
            1. High crime wave: There is a natural tendency towards self-destruction when species see 
            their own numbers endangering the survival of their species. The increasing population and 
            overcrowding has led to the growth of vandalism and violence. The great bunged of 
            unemployed youths when disappointed with town life, turn to begging, gambling, murder and 
            alcoholism with the lean objective of making ends meet on a daily basis. 
            2. Social adjustment problems: Town life is diametrically opposed to village life. The new 
            comers to town find it difficult and at times impossible to cope with the new tendencies of 
            break up links with relatives, meeting and interacting with many people from several 
            backgrounds and culture and living with the “I do not care attitudes” common in towns. 
            3. Commuting problems: The overcrowding in inner-cities is popularly solved in most 
            MEDCs through the creation of dormitory towns at the outskirts, from where workers go 
            daily into the inner city for work. Furthermore, industrial sites have moved further away from 
            the urban hearts, drawing their labour force from the urban districts as well as from nearby 
            villages. By this strategy, workers now live far from work places and this has caused 
            problems to these commuters as the journey to work has become long, more expensive, 
            uncomfortable and time consuming. 
            4. Poverty: The high unemployment in the inner city has induced rising urban poverty. This is 
            especially in countries where government support is either low has been withdrawn. 
            5. Inadequate and poor housing: The rapid urbanization saw the quick expansion of many 
            towns, both large and small. The now large towns and cities developed very high densities 
            for example Paris, London, Tokyo, Mexico city and Cairo. The burgeoning urban population 
            has therefore induced very high population and room densities which have made the 
            provision of adequate proper accommodation a problem. As such where the population 
            pressure on housing is great, urbanites move their squatters into unused suburban spaces and 
            build makeshift shacks (slums, ghettos and shanty towns) which present great problems 
            urban development and planning. 
            G. Solutions to Urban Problems 
            a. Solution to Unemployment and underemployment - The urban authorities have to be constantly on the watch for development opportunities by 
            offering attractive terms and economic stability for foreign investors to channel their 
            investments in the city and suburban areas. 
            - - - - - - - - 
            There should be revitalization of the rural areas so that they become attractive to farmers and 
            holdback people in the rural areas. 
            In the urban areas, labour intensive industries have been set up so that they could absorb the 
            large pool of idling and underemployed able hands. There has also been the encouragement 
            of the informal sector so that self-employment can be generated for urban dwellers. 
            Facilities should be created to teach the people the various skills in the industrial and 
            commercial fields so that the investors can be assured of the people to make their 
            investments grow. 
            b. Solutions to environmental problems 
            Waste water should be treated (through filtration and use of chemicals) before disposal into 
            streams so as to avoid contamination of water and aquatic species. 
            Solid waste should be sorted and regularly collected. This entails that more collection sites 
            should be set up in all parts of the city. 
            Liquid waste is collected through a cleansing network since in the urban areas there is little 
            infiltration. The direct sewage drainage serves as waste evacuation methods with large 
            channels used for waste circulation. 
            Some waste as paper, plastic, iron and glass should be recycled and used. 
            Some added value should be given to waste. This is through the use of waste to produce 
            valuable items as compost manure and easily combustibles should be burnt in thermal centres 
            to produce fertilizers. 
            c. Solutions to urban transport and commuting  
             Modifications in road systems through provision of one-way streets, bus lanes, traffic lights 
            at road junctions, parking metres and yellow junction boxes. A good example is the 
            development of underground road circulation system in Paris. 
             New roads have been built, with old ones modified and repaired and urban motorways and 
            ring roads developed. This has been developed in the towns of Douala, Yaounde, Bamenda, 
            Bafoussam, Kumba, Buea and Limbe all in Cameroon. 
             Widening of existing streets, built out-of-town motorways ring roads around towns and many 
            flyovers. This has been seen in Yaounde and Douala with the building of simplified flyovers. 
             Implement the policy of Traffic-Pedestrian Circulation Segregation. This through the 
            restriction of private cars from certain areas, creation of pedestrian precincts and tracks, 
            subways, high-level footways and high ways. 
            
            
             New transport systems have been introduced such as electrically driven motor cars, monorail, 
            high speed trains and helicopters. These however, have high capital cost and a limited 
            technical life. 
            d. Solutions to Housing and Housing congestion problems 
             Clearance and renewal: This entails the invasion of land of the self-help housing of clearing 
            them off and replacing them with conventional housing schemes. This outright clearance of 
            the slums was popular until the 1960s. this method has been very recurrent in Douala and 
            Yaounde in the squatters and marshes. 
             Rents control: In many areas this was used as a separate approach to ensure more affordable 
            housing especially for the low paid workers out of the specific issue of self-help housing. 
            This policy was greatly used in Mexico where the majority of low paid workers occupied 
            rented accommodations. 
             Renovation and refurbishing: These stem from the school of thought which argued that in 
            LEDCs, particularly in Zimbabwe, substandard housing should be regarded as part of the 
            existing housing stock. This is because their weak economies cannot locate enough money 
            for the construction of the required number of houses. 
             Adaptation and rehabilitation programmes: This is the process of improving or upgrading of 
            the conditions of the existing shanty towns without displacing the people. This has taken 
            varied forms in many parts of the world notably in Mozambique, Bolivia and Pakistan. 
             Provision of social amenities: This is an additional effort to improve on the housing and 
            living environment of the urban dweller. The main medium of reducing the magnitude of the 
            shortage in social amenities has been through the improvement in the technology of 
            managing these basic amenities. 
            e. Solutions to urban sprawl 
             Creation of new towns: These new towns have houses and all recreational facilities that can 
            attract people from overcrowded cities and conurbations. These have been used in order to 
            decongest Chicago and New York in the USA; and Manchester, Birmingham and London. 
            As of now it is mainly a concept for the MEDCs because money is needed in great sums. 
             Decentralization: This entails decentralizing most services and functions that attract people to 
            cities. By taking them to rural areas or countryside, the attraction will be reversed thereby 
            decongesting and checking urban growth especially in LEDCs. For example the 
            
            
            decentralization of universities and secondary education in Cameroon and the extension of 
            rural electrification are some measures of making rural areas more attractive in Cameroon. 
             Higher wages and industries in rural areas: This is meant to render rural areas more 
            attractive. This can be done by creating conditions favourable for industries to set in rural 
            areas through low taxes, tax holidays, credits, subsidies, make agriculture more attractive 
            through guaranteed prices and imposing legislative calling for higher wages for rural workers 
            than town dwellers. 
             Restrictive in-migration laws: This is to make it difficult to move and acquire permanent 
            resident in certain towns. For example in the case of USA this has been imposed for cities as 
            Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago and Baltimore. This is difficult if not impossible in the 
            LEDCs because many inlets exist and no registration of residents is done. 
             Commuting and dormitory settlements: Due to better and cheaper transport facilities as rails, 
            roads, motorways and airports, most people fly in and out without necessarily living in the 
            cities. By this commuting, people live in the outskirts and move daily to work in towns and 
            return to these outskirts in the evenings. The result is that in the evening city centres are 
            “dead or ghost”. Dormitory settlements are built for urban workers on town outskirts and this 
            checks urban growth. 
             Green Belts: This is a zone of the countryside on the outskirts of town where there is strict 
            legislation controlling present housing and industrial development and meant for the 
            provision of recreation for city dwellers (citedal). These types of open spaces at the edges of 
            towns guarded by stringent measures check urban growth and are held as communal land. 
            Lesson 11: Current Trends in Urbanisation 
            At the start of the 20th century, events occurring in the urban landscape especially those of the 
            MEDCs signaled a new phase in the cycle of urbanization. As early as the start of the 20th 
            century it was realized that the process of urbanization was experiencing a reversed course in 
            most old urbanized countries. This urban decentralization or de-urbanisation started gradually in 
            a process which has been called suburbanization and then gathered momentum in the inter war 
            years (1920s and 1930s) when improvement in transport and rising affluence among ordinary 
            people led to rapid spread of suburbs around major cities and reached its peak within the 1970s 
            and 1980s when it became termed counter urbanization. 
            
            
            I. Suburbanisation 
            After the World War II (from the 1950s), urban growth was characterized by a completely new 
            phenomenon as most large urban centres saw the growth of various but new residential land uses 
            spring up around their immediate outskirts. This tendency has been termed suburban growth or 
            growth of the suburbs. This process of suburban expansion has been popularly called 
            suburbanization. Hence, suburbanization can be defined as “the decentralization of people, 
            employment and services from the inner and central areas of the cities and their relocation 
            towards the margins of the built-up area”. It can also be referred to as “the process of growth of 
            the suburbs areas”. 
            Suburbs on their part refers to different residential areas out of the city centre or the residential 
            areas beyond the metropolitan centre populated by the wealthy in modern cities today and by the 
            poor in medieval cities and some cities in the LEDCs; part of the metropolitan area beyond the 
            political boundaries of a city but closely connected to it economically and socially. Two types 
            exist i.e. the exclusive suburb (those reserved entirely for the upper-class principally and entry is 
            allowed only to the very affluent) and mixed land use suburbs (they are usually for those in the 
            middle income range). 
            Characteristics of suburban Areas (Suburbs) 
            1. The existence of a housing mosaic: Just as the general town setting, suburbs possess 
            distinctive zones especially in terms of housing. From the edge of the CBD to the edge of the 
            suburb, the housing decreases in age, quality, density and occupants. Houses towards the 
            CBD are normally closely packed, old blocks of flats, small terraced houses, or renovated, 
            mostly occupied by the poor who suffer from two inabilities i.e. unable to occupy too much 
            land since land rents are high and cannot afford to pay the transport cost for commuting. 
            2. Social segregation: This is another very visible characteristic of the suburban areas. On the 
            broad or wide scale, where by entire sectors are dominated by distinct social or ethnic 
            classes. At a local scale whereby small individual housing estates or merely streets are 
            dominated by different income groups. This socio-economic segregation is caused by 
            constraints of cost, the policies of builders, chance elements, human nature, topography. 
            3. High degree of dynamism: Due to the rapid changing socio-economic conditions, suburbs 
            are continuously experiencing changes in their spatial and demographic characteristics. 
            
            
            These changes have established two very visible but opposing process-filtering and 
            gentrification. Filtering is the tendency for lower income migrants to move into deteriorated 
            housing previously owned by middle income groups, who have now abandoned them for the 
            better housing in the suburbs. Gentrification on the other hand is the process whereby middle 
            and upper income groups occupy older city housing by upgrading older city properties 
            through renovation. It is a process in which wealthier people move into renovate and restore 
            running down housing in an inner city or other neglected areas formerly inhabited by low
            income groups. 
            4. The Dual economic nature: Occasionally, complete social contrast (rich and poor) are 
            juxtaposed. This is visible in Britain in Kensington and Notting Hill. In Cameroon in the 
            Bastos and Mesas areas of Yaounde. 
            5. Greater Rural-Urban Interaction: The very nature of the inner city and outskirt suffering 
            different services has led to much interaction between these two sections of the modern city. 
            Those who live and work in the urban areas use the nearby town and city services 
            (supermarkets) which are absent in their suburbanized settlements. 
            
            Factors or Reasons for Suburbanisation 
            a. Push factors 
            1. The inner city problems: By the end of the first decade of the 20th century, it was clear 
            already in the MEDCs that with urban growth, inner cities soon became busy, noisy, 
            congested with factories and people, polluted and plague with poor communication. These 
            conditions became very unconducive for comfortable living and so those (middle class) who 
            could afford to move away from the inner city edge, did this. This move spurred up the rise 
            of suburbs. 
            2. Urban population explosion: In most MEDCs, the natural increase in towns and rural 
            exodus, have pushed urban areas to reach saturation points in terms of sheer human numbers. 
            As a result of this growth, excess population in central areas has over spilled into suburban 
            areas beyond the administrative borders of the towns. Immigration from rural areas directly 
            into the city edge has pushed further outwards the suburbs.  
            b. Pull factors 
            
            
            1. Development in urban transport: The rapid growth of cities especially into the urban 
            fringes has been linked greatly to improvement in urban transport systems since the 19th 
            century but particularly in the 20th century. The dawn of the 20th century saw the rapid 
            improvement of transport facilities initiated in the 19th century. The road and railway 
            infrastructure became diversified, the quality improved for better performance and to provide 
            comfort on long distance journeys. 
            2. Improvement in standards of living: By the end of the 19th century, conditions had 
            improved considerably over those of the previous 5o years. The dawn of the 20th century 
            ushered in an era of great optimism. The rising expectations and aspirations were matched by 
            increasing wages and living standards. 
            3. Decline in the value of agricultural land: There was a dramatic fall in land values for 
            farming activities. Land was now more profitable when engaged into other urban activities 
            than farming. This situation facilitated the scope for urban expansion on a massive scale. 
            4. Changes in human nature and lifestyles: The 2oth century saw the birth of new preferences 
            and life styles. In most western countries there was a new growth in optimism. This was 
            popularly called the “American dream” of a better living. The increasing wealth of the 
            middle and upper classes, and improved availability of transport means resulted in many 
            people making preference to live in low density housing surrounded by gardens and away 
            from sound and air pollution. 
            5. Government action or planning policies: The movement to the edge of the city is more 
            than just reflection of upward social mobility. It is at times a planned move by central 
            authorities. This tendency is currently occurring in the LEDCs with the establishment of 
            industrial free zones. This is reinforced by the provision of utilities at the periphery or 
            outskirts like gas, electricity by local authorities. All these encourage drift of people and 
            economic activities towards the periphery. 
            Consequences of Suburbanisation 
            a. Effects on inner cities 
            1. Deterioration of inner cities: The movement of people, industries and retail out of the inner 
            cities leaves them to have old sub-standardised housing. Abandoned residences, factory 
            buildings and warehouses relapsed into derelict spaces and buildings. This gives the inner 
            
            
            cities an old decayed look except where renewal efforts have been vigorously undertaken. 
            There is usually a general environmental deterioration. 
            2. Promotion of conservation: Since some of the houses were privately owned and stood 
            isolated in gardens, people lived more to themselves. There was therefore a growth in 
            conformity and an unwillingness to upset the status quo. Generally, suburban areas have been 
            described as lacking community spirit. 
            3. A drop in the living standards of the poor: Studies have shown that the development of 
            suburban life did not yield equal benefits to all. In fact the conditions of the poor worsen as 
            they had to cope with an extra burden as increases in mortgage payments for private house 
            building, travel cost, food costs, and the higher cost incurred in heating the new larger 
            houses. 
            4. Decline of the Central Business District (CBD): The attractive nature of the city fringe and 
            its increasing accessibility has coerced most down town to decline. A decline in industrial 
            activity and retailing as most of them have shifted or moved to the periphery or city edges. 
            The ultimate consequence is that there is the development of “dead hearts” at the inner city. 
            5. The growth of ghettoes: Many poor inner city dwellers fit it extremely difficult to ‘break 
            out’ to higher quality housing areas elsewhere in the city. Under these circumstances the poor 
            housing situation deteriorates faster as repairs and maintenance works slow down or stop 
            completely. This is very common in black quarters of the USA and many ethnic quarters in 
            the LEDCs. 
            b. Effects on general character of Urban Morphology 
            1. Development of Suburban Free Way Corridors: These are lines of well-developed 
            transport routes at the periphery of towns that encircle the large urban areas. These freeways 
            act as corridors of growth and since the 1960s they have generally become new focal points 
            for commercial and industrial development wherever they occur. 
            2. Growth of contemporary edge cities: These are zones at the periphery of metropolitan 
            areas in which a significant recent concentration of retailing, offices and high technology 
            industry has occurred. This is a zone in the suburbs with a mix of economic activities similar 
            to those at the centre of cities further down the urban hierarchy. 
            3. The expansion of the Rural-Urban fringe: As people and urban land uses drift to the edge 
            of the city, the characteristics of the urban fringe extend far into the countryside. The result 
            
            
            has been the widening of the zone of transition between what is purely urban and that which 
            is purely rural. 
            c. Demographic consequences 
            1. Redistribution of Urban population: As much of the inner city population moved out into 
            suburban location, the result was that while the inner city population slightly declined, that of 
            suburban areas doubled. For example, the population of London increased by 10% in the 
            1920s but the built-up area doubled. 
            2. An increase in total population: The process has led to an increase in the numbers living in 
            edges of the towns especially those around large cities. The rapid population growth is as a 
            result of the fact that the town’s outskirts become population growth poles as they receive 
            overspill population from the inner cities. 
            d. Effects on Rural geography  
            1. Destruction of the natural landscape and impacts on farming: As the suburbs spread out 
            horizontally, they eat up much of agricultural land and vegetation reserves. Also, other 
            aspects of the natural beauty of the countryside are interrupted and converted into artificial 
            features completely or modified to degraded levels. 
            2. Urban Sprawl: This is when the physical pattern of low density expansion of urban areas 
            under market conditions into surrounding agricultural areas. As accessibility to urban areas 
            increase through improvement in public and private transport between 1919 and 1939, most 
            cities of the MEDCs expanded into the surrounding countryside at a rapid and uncontrolled 
            rate. 
            3. Enjoyment of Double-Benefits: Many of the people living near the edge of the city or just 
            beyond it enjoy both the benefits of the inner urban zone (super markets, night clubs) and 
            those of the rural areas (natural cynosure, recreational facilities). 
            II. Counter Urbanisation 
            A. Definition: This process refers to “population decentralization as people move from large 
            urban areas to smaller urban settlements and rural areas”. It can also be termed “the outflow 
            of people and economic activities completely from the city to more rural areas away from 
            large cities, pressurized by diseconomies and poorer living conditions in core and inner areas 
            of large cities and attracted by space, lower land cost, pleasant environment, facilitated by 
            greater mobility and better communications. 
            
            
            This process remained mainly a feature of cities in MEDCs until the 1990s. For example, in 
            Britain urban decentralization of population appears as the most consistent and dominant 
            feature of population movement. However in recent times, much evidence exists to the act 
            that the process has appeared around some conurbations of the LEDCs for example the “edge 
            cities” around Rio de Janeiro. 
            B. Factors Favouring Counter urbanization 
            1. Personal decision to migrate: In the 1980s, retailers in Britain were flowing as they did 
            years ago America, to out-of-town shopping malls. 
            2. The needs of industries for vast lands: Modern industry is conceived on a horizontal plane. 
            Thus it needs much land for its different installations which urban areas can not provide. 
            3. Continued developments in the transport sector: Rapid improvements in urban transport 
            networks have increased individual mobility. This is in the form of development of 
            motorways, railways linking the city with their surrounding countryside and neighbouring 
            dormitory and satellite towns. 
            4. Progress in telecommunication and information technology: This allows people to 
            communicate over long distances. Thus telecommunication and computers were making the 
            hard slog into work, unnecessary for growing numbers. Al these permit people to live away 
            from the city but still remain part of the whole urban life since movement is faster and long 
            distance communication is possible. 
            5. Urban redevelopment: Government policies such as the creation of New towns and 
            Greenbelts favour population dispersal. This movement was started as many people forced to 
            move as large areas of the 19th century inner-city housing were demolished were re-housed in 
            planned New Towns. E.g Liverpool to Runcorn. 
            6. Rise in rents in core areas: For example, around London where rents are very high, offices 
            have diffused widely across southeast England. 
            C. Consequences of Counter Urbanisation 
            a. Urbanization of rural areas or countryside: Even though the growth in the population of 
            most cities has been slowed down by suburban growth, this very phenomenon is fueling the 
            rapid spread of the urban landscape. This is manifested in the urbanization of villages and the 
            spatial spread of urbianisation. 
            b. The development of the urban-rural continuum: Urban decentralization has made the 
            traditional distinction of settlements into rural and urban increasingly difficult. Hence “there 
            
            
            is now no clear distinction  between where urban settlements ends and rural settlements 
            begins, but a broad gradation showing a decrease in the degree of urbanity with increasing 
            distance from the city”. This is what is called the urban continuum. 
            c. Decrease in the overall size of the cities: This is especially the case of North America and 
            Western Europe. The trend from the most urban to the least urban is highly regular. Thus 
            there is a general trend of “down-the urban hierarchy” or counter urbanization, cascade. Thus 
            depending in the degree of “urbanees” and distance from the metropolitan centres, some 
            urban areas and districts are net migration losses while others all net gainers. 
            d. Over dispersion: This has led to the recent decline of some parts of the established CBDs 
            and fears about over dispersion of tertiary activities. There has been a rise in vacant lots, 
            physical deterioration, loss of employment opportunity and revenue necessary to maintain the 
            needed services as roads lightning. 
            III. Reurbanisation  
            A. Definition: It is the process of gradual movement of people, industry and commercial 
            activities back into the inner cities. i.e. it is a process in the urbanization cycle where by 
            “people and activities hitherto concentrated in the suburbs and country sides are drifting back 
            into the inner city”. This process of ‘urban rejuvenation’ took rot in the early 1990s and has 
            intensified since then. 
            
            B. Causes of Re-urbanisation 
            a. Urban planning efforts: The terminal consequences of the de-urbanisation process are the 
            development of cities with “dead hearts”. In order to avoid having many “heartless” cities on 
            the urban landscape, planning initiatives have been designed to refurbish and redesign inner 
            cities. 
            b. Better management of inner city transport: Measure taken in many cities to improve on 
            urban transport (especially the reduction of the traffic congestion problem) through urban 
            traffic restrictions schemes has boosted inner city revival greatly. E.g. the “ring of steel” in 
            London was successfully used to control traffic. 
            c.  Energy conservation: The rapid process of counter urbanization led to increasing distance 
            between residence and place of work. The numerous hold ups caused frustration and sapped 
            energy. In order to avoid this and save energy for work, people working in inner cities started 
            drifting back into the inner city so as to live closer to the place of work. 
            
            
            d. Changes in the housing market: As the suburbs and countryside developed, housing 
            became relatively more expensive than in the inner city. Thus, there was now a new drive to 
            improve on inner city housing in both quality and quantity. This is especially as there was 
            fierce opposition to the relaxation of planning restrictions in the countryside. 
            e. Changes in attitudes: In addition to the economic progress and others, wider trends seemed 
            to have contributed also to urban revival. This new desire to live in inner city was not just by 
            the greater numbers of young people but by of all ages surprising including the old. Thus, 
            there was a new wave of influx to towns by both the rich and poor and the young and the old 
            alike. 
            f. Reduction in urban street crime: The heart of most metropolitan areas in decline is the 
            haven of all sorts of criminality. In many cities of the MEDCs, there has been the installation 
            of automated closed circuit surveillance cameras. This has improved great public perception 
            of central areas. 
            C. Consequences of Reurbanisation 
            1. Increase crime wave: The inability for people to harvest lucrative jobs in the inner cities 
            following their influx from the surrounding rural areas (suburbs) and the quest to earn a 
            living within the cities leaves them with no choice than to indulge into criminal activities like 
            drugs, armed robbery, etc. especially in cities of the LEDCs. 
            2. Overcrowding: Due to the mass influx of people of all ages and classes into the inner cities, 
            there is usually overcrowding along major streets and on the available and insufficient social 
            amenities like hospitals, cinemas, pipe borne water, etc. this is also coupled with 
            overcrowding in homes. 
            3. Development of poor and inadequate housing: Mass influx into the inner cities from the 
            rural areas increases cost of housing (rents) and in an attempt to evade this high cost of rent, 
            people resort to constructing makeshift structures (ghettoes, slumps and shanty towns) for 
            themselves. This scenario is very prominent in the cities of LEDCs like Douala, Yaounde, 
            etc. 
            Lesson 12: Urban Regions 
            The rapid pace of urbanization in the 19th century and trends in the 20th century, have resulted in 
            the development of urban regions. The growth and expansion of these urban regions have in turn 
            intensified the numerous relationships that exist between the city and their surrounding areas. 
            
            
            since the year 1800, various terms have been used to describe this development of urban regions. 
            They include 
            1. Million or Millionaire Cities 
            These are towns and cities whose population exceeds one million people. This is merely a recent 
            phenomenon as by 1800, the only “million city” was London with Paris joining it in 1850 and 
            New York became the third in about 1870. By 1900s the number was 11; by 1940 there were 51 
            and 129 by 1970. The growth of million cities has been very rapid. At the start of the 20th century 
            (1900) they were limited to Europe. Some few appeared I Africa and North America by 1910. 
            When they appeared in Asia by 1920, the dominance of Europe started to decline. Since 1960s, 
            Asia has been dominating in the share of million cities. Even though the number and size of 
            million cities continue to rise, there is great disparity between those of the developed and the 
            least developed lands.  
            In Europe, growth rates have begun to slow down with London and Paris virtually static 
            although their build-up areas may have grown because of counterurbanisation. Conversely, in 
            Asia and Latin America the growth is almost explosive with some towns experiencing an 
            increase of more than seven times in their populations. 
            
            
            Advantages of millionaire cities 
             They offer a wide variety of employment opportunities in commerce, manufacturing, 
            administration and transportation. Thus their inhabitants can therefore change from one job 
            to another without the trouble of moving house. 
             Employers benefit from a diversity of financial, legal, technical and advertising facilities. 
             The inhabitants have accessibility to a wide range of shops including highly specialized 
            retailers and departmental stores. 
             The citizens also have access to the entertainment places such as theatres and clubs as well as 
            cultural opportunities e.g. concert halls, arts galleries and museums. 
             They also have a wide choice of several good schools and well-equiped, well-staffed 
            hospitals. 
            
            
            Disadvantages 
             They lack the community spirit which is common in smaller towns. Their citizens are not 
            very stable and have their roots elsewhere. 
             Traffic congestion and parking problems are endemic and overwhelming. 
             There is large-scale air, water and land pollution, which also endangers the health of citizens 
            and the environment. 
             The countryside is deprived of its youthful population as it drifts into these areas in search of 
            “gold and honey”. 
             The distance to and from workplace is long and uncomfortable and during rush hours can be 
            very frustrating due to go slows. This is very detrimental to mental health. 
            2. Conurbation (Metropolitan or Super Cities) 
            It is a large continuous urban area resulting from the engulfment of expanding smaller 
            centres by physical extension of a major city or the coalescence of two or more urban areas of 
            roughly similar size through urban sprawl. The term conurbations was first used by Patrick 
            Geddes in his book titled “cities I evolution published in 1915. It should be noted that by 1990, 
            seven major conurbations existed and several minor ones. The eight large conurbations in 
            England accounted for about 40% of the total population of the country in 1990. The most 
            prominent conurbations of Britain is the “Black Country” in Midlands of England that engulfs 
            among other towns, Birmingham. The largest conurbation in Europe is that around the Rhur
            Westphalia coalfield region in Germany (2500km2). Other examples across the world include;  
            the Randstad (Rotterdam to Amsterdam) in Netherlands, the Tokama (Tokyo to Yokohama 
            region) in Japan, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region of Canada and the Eastern seaboard of 
            USA (the Boswash). 
            Types of conurbations  
            a. Polycentric (Polynuclear): These are those which have resulted from the fusion of a number 
            of distinct towns and cities linked by roads, highways and railways to form a continuous 
            built-up area, so that each original city has its core. Here, the individual towns tend to grow 
            and expand towards each other till they eventually merge as a continuous urban or industrial 
            belt. Examples are the Pittsburgh district, the Western side of Lake Eie all in USA, Upper 
            Silesia in Poland, the Lille-Roubaix-Tourcing triangle in northeast France. 
            
            
            b. Monocentric (Uninuclear): These are those which have resulted from the expansion of a 
            single major city outward until it engulfs smaller towns and cities. Examples include: 
            London, Paris, Buenos Aires, Sydney, Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, Calcuta, Tokyo, and 
            Bangkok. 
            Characteristics of conurbations 
             They have particular sites at which they develop i.e. they are sited either on major coalfields 
            or around natural harbours. 
             They have particular base activities. Most conurbations are based on intensive commerce and 
            manufacturing, and are characterized by a dense network of communication facilities. 
             The atmosphere above them are highly covered by smoke and dirt is common in the 
            settlement. 
             Most of them are without plan and are thus amorphous (without any clear shape or form). 
             Their central parts are dominated by closely packed working class housing and factories. 
            These central parts are often in need of urban renewal 
             Most are ports with important trade functions or centres of former empires. 
             They are mostly primate cities and so dominate the country in terms of size, location of 
            manufacturing, investment and power. 
            
            
            Problems of conurbations (case of Rhur conurbation) 
             Traffic congestion all over the area. This is because the transport system is not only costly 
            but also outdated. 
             Coal mining is fast declining in favour of imported petroleum. This development has 
            attracted new petro-chemical industries to the area. 
             The difficulty of provision of social services as sport complexes and recreational centres. 
            This is because it certainty necessitates the displacement and resettlement of people. This is a 
            process that will be problematic to urban planners. 
             Pollution is also is a major problem. Dense smoke from factories tends to pollute the 
            atmosphere. Environmental pollution comes from noise and sewage disposal. 
            
            
             Heavy dependence on outside sources of food and raw material. In case of no supply people 
            suffer from acute shortages. 
            Solutions to some problems 
             Diversification of the industries. This is to create more job opportunities and solve 
            unemployment. 
             A development strategy for opening out the core area by creating new residential areas in the 
            less densely people tract south of the river Rhur. This was to solve the problem of 
            congestion. 
             Encouraging industries to move northward into the spacious Lippe valley, westwards= 
            beyond the Rhine and eastward beyond Dortmund. This is to solve pollution and congestion 
            problems. 
             Built new road and motorways and safeguarding the existing green areas. 
            3. Megalopolis or Megacities  
            The continued operation of the same processes which create conurbations has led to the 
            coalescing of the vast built-up areas to form entirely urbanized regions called megalopolis. Thus 
            megalopolis are super-metropolitan urban regions or very extensive urban zones which extend 
            across many kilometres (often even thousands) and link formerly separate conurbations and 
            contain at least 10 million people. In other words, it is a highly urbanized region which 
            encompasses a number of large conurbations and many smaller urban centres, where 
            decentralization and coalescence are at an advanced stage. Thus the metropolis is a vast urban 
            zone that dwarfs even the largest cities by comparison. 
            Prominent examples in the world today are: Chi-Pits (Chicago to Pittsburgh with 20 million 
            people), San-San (San Francisco – San Diego with 80 million people), Boswash, Tokama, 
            Bangkok, Delhi, Karachi, etc. 
            Factors (Causes of) Responsible for the development of Megalopolis 
            a. Some of these zones have evolved naturally: The best example of this is the Atlantic 
            seaboard of the USA (BOSWASH) and in Japan. According to Professor Jean Gottman the 
            development of this particular megalopolis was due to the development of overseas trade and 
            the competitive role played by a number of towns at the coast which wanted to share it. 
            
            
            b. Design or planning: This is the case of Randstad in the Netherlands. By the year 1990, there 
            were only three megalopolis existing in the world (BOSWASH, Tokama or Tokaido and 
            Randstad). Since the year 2000, there has been a rapid rise in megacities in the LEDCs and 
            by the year 2025, it is projected that Asia alone will have more than 20 cities with population 
            over 10million people. But as of now, all but 8 of the world megacities are in Asia (Delhi, 
            Bongkok, Karachi, etc.). 
            Lesson 13: Urban Fields (Sphere of Influence) 
            A. Meaning 
            Urban settlements are inextricably bound up with their surrounding areas to operate as a unified 
            functional region. These urban and surrounding regions inter-linkages are quite vital in the study 
            of settlements and these relationships have been popularly called Urban Fields. 
            Just like any other concept, it has varied definitions but the most popular definition considers it 
            as “the mutual benefit gained from the movement of people, gods, finance, information and 
            influence from a central town or central place to the surrounding region and from the 
            surrounding regions to a central town”. Other views hold that; it is the area around a town which 
            it serves and from which it draws resources and customers for its shops and users of its various 
            services. Also, it is seen as the area around a settlement that comes under its economic, social 
            and political influence (sphere of influence). Hence, it is the physical, social and economic 
            interrelationships between the central town and its surroundings or the economic and social 
            interdependence of the town and its country side. 
            Functional Relationships within Urban Fields 
            a. Agricultural relationships: The rural areas supply a town with essential food stuffs such as 
            vegetables, dairy produce and especially with fruits. In return the town acts as a collecting 
            and marketing centre for agricultural commodities. For example, the origin and growth of 
            urban settlements depended on the origin of a food surplus from the surrounding countryside. 
            b. Industrial relationship: Urban factories may process the raw materials obtained from the 
            surrounding area in centres as lumber mills, textile, manufacturing, steelworks, canning 
            industries etc. the rural areas may in turn use these products supplied by the towns. For 
            example, farm machinery, artificial fertilisers and transport equipment. 
            
            
            c. Commuting relationships: People travel into a town to work, perhaps from dormitory towns 
            some distance away or from villages. In the reverse direction some town dwellers might 
            travel out from the urban centre to work in small scale agricultural based industries in the 
            surrounding villages. 
            d. Social relationships: People travel into a town from the surrounding region to enjoy the 
            entertainments, recreational or cultural facilities offered. Many town dwellers travel in the 
            opposite direction to the rural area or to the coast for picnics, recreation or sightseeing, etc. 
            e. Trade relationships: The rural areas provide a certain proportion of the retail and customers 
            of a town’s shops. In return the town supplies specialized services like professional and 
            health facilities and manufactured goods of all sorts. 
            NB: It should be recalled here that the strength and extent of these functional relationships vary 
            from one urban area to another. 
            B. Shapes and Sizes of Urban Fields 
            Urban fields have significant spatial differences in terms of shapes and sizes. The shapes and 
            sizes of urban fields therefore vary from settlement to settlement. This variation is examined 
            below as well as the factors responsible. 
            1. Variation in the sizes of urban fields 
            This is the most variable aspect of urban fields since they are consistently sized according to the 
            population and number of functions of their central places. On the landscape therefore, some 
            urban fields are very large while others are small. Others have very weak links with the 
            surrounding while others develop very strong links. All this differences is accounted for by the 
            following factors. 
            Factors of Spatial Variation in Sizes of Urban Fields  
            a. Character of the town: The size of an urban field depends essentially on the degree of 
            development of the town as a central place. It is generally agreed that urban fields of larger 
            towns tend to be wider than those of similar towns. This is not however true in all situations 
            because towns of the same sizes often have different sizes of urban field and in some cases 
            small multifunctional towns have wider spheres of influence than large towns with a 
            
            
            simplified functional structure. Hence, the urban fields of a very large industrial and/mining 
            town tend to be restricted than that of a market town of same size or even those of smaller 
            but mixed functions towns. This is partly because the former have not grown up specifically 
            to service the surrounding population. 
            b. The number and manner of distribution of urban settlements: The spacing of 
            neighbouring towns also has a great influence in the size of an urban field. That is to say a 
            service centre for example may have a relatively large urban field if there are no competing 
            centres located nearby. Thus, where urban settlements are few and widely spaced, urban 
            fields tend to be large. But where they are many and closely spaced, overlapping occurs 
            within short distances which reduce the size of the urban fields. This is typical with towns in 
            the western region of Cameroon which have smaller urban fields because of their number and 
            their closeness to each other as compared to those in the Southwest, Northwest, South, East, 
            and Grand North regions which have large urban fields due to the long distances separating 
            them. 
            c. Urban facilities offered: This is linked to the number and types of functions offered by the 
            settlement. A town with a wide range of diverse functions including specialized functions 
            tends to have wider fields of influence than that with few services because the specialized 
            functions attract people from far. E.g. the case of Yaounde and Douala in Cameroon, Lagos 
            in Nigeria, Johannesburg in South Africa, etc.  
            d. The multiplier effect: This measures the degree to which services generated at a town and 
            extended to its dependent areas are being extended further to some other settlements down 
            the settlement hierarchy. When this tendency of goods distribution is high then there is a 
            higher multiplier effect and this tends to widen the sphere of influence of the producing town. 
            e. Nature of the physical milieu: An urban centre located in an area where the terrain is 
            difficult will tend to have a restricted urban field than one found on an extensive well drained 
            plain. Thus, an urban centre near areas where physical barriers such as a river, estuary and 
            mountainous or difficult relief exists may become relatively isolated. 
            f. Population density of the region: Areas with fairly low population densities tend to have 
            widely spread towns and so produce large urban fields. Conversely, areas of high population 
            densities tend to have numerous towns that are close together and so produce smaller urban 
            fields. 
            
            
            g. Transport network development: This is a measure of the degree of accessibility. The 
            development of good road networks and god public transport systems can extend the range of 
            a town’s influence in a particular direction. Generally, when the level of transport and other 
            communication network development is high, the size of the urban field increases. This is 
            because it facilitates movement and interaction between the town and its surroundings. On 
            the other hand, if the network deteriorates, the town’s sphere of influence also drops. 
            2. Variation in the Shapes of Urban Fields 
            The form taken by urban fields is not regularly shaped unlike the theoretical conclusions 
            advanced by Walter Christaller (Central Place Theory), as these shapes of urban fields are 
            greatly affected by relief, communication, cultural attributes and infrastructural developments. 
            Thus based on these factors, the following shapes of urban fields can be identified: 
            a. Elongated urban field: This commonly develops in areas where the links between a town 
            and the surrounding area are constructed on a narrow valley along a river, ridge or even 
            coastlines are often truncated by mountains. 
            b. Circular urban field: This develops when the town is found on a broad plain that makes it 
            possible for the towns influence to spread outward in all directions in the same magnitude. 
            c. Irregular urban field: This is found in areas where links between a town and some parts of 
            its surrounding area are obstructed by cultural and political barriers. 
            d. Linear urban field: They develop along communication lines as transport routes. This is 
            because the town’s growth and thus its influence follow the communication extensions lines. 
            They however broaden near railway stations and at route intersections. 
            e. Star-shaped urban field: This type develops in areas where route networks radiate from a 
            central point of a town in different directions to surrounding regions. As they extend along 
            main route arteries they become star-shaped. The town and its influence tend to extend 
            outward along the radial routes, thereby resulting in a star shape. 
            
            3. Variations of Urban Fields Over Time 
            The shapes and sizes of urban fields change continually in response to social, economic and 
            technological developments as well as developments in transport, urban facilities and human 
            behavior. Attention has been drawn to the fact that an increasing number of people live in the 
            countryside but work, shop and are educated in towns. Thus in recent times it is observed that 
            many towns are extending the range of their urban fields wile, and old distinction between town 
            
            
            and countryside are rapidly being broken down. The question now is; what underlies these 
            changes?. Changes that urban field constantly adjust to are therefore hereby closely examined. 
            a. Transport development: Improved public transport or greater use of the motor car will 
            widen urban fields; whereas deteriorating public transport will have the opposite effect. 
            Similarly, the opening of new stretch of motorway or a new bridge will extend a towns 
            influence. 
            b. Economic development: A newly built shopping precinct will probably encourage people to 
            travel into a town further afield than before. Likewise, the closing of a popular departmental 
            store may severely restrict the area from which the town’s customers are drawn. e.g. closure 
            of Fokou, Niki, Nziko and Score in Yaounde and Monoprix in Douala will reduce the 
            number of shoppers entering theses cities. 
            c. Technological development: Improvements like creating new industries with new products 
            tends to expand market area and pull labour from far afield. This expansion therefore widens 
            the field of influence of such an urban area. 
            d. Social amenities: The establishment of new cinemas, cafés, restaurants, educational facilities 
            as universities, specialists hospitals tend to expand urban fields. e.g. SOA and Buea, 
            Yaounde and Dschang with new universities saw their spheres of influence particularly of 
            educational links widened after 1993 with the addition of university functions to their 
            spectrum of functions. Conversely Ngoa Kelle will no longer be as influential as before 
            because its role as lone university town was undermined with the dencentralisation of the 
            state universities. 
            e. Regional variation in income per head and a wide range of related factors (price, fashion, 
            popularity, variety, influence of individual choice of shops and services). These determine 
            the general pattern of size and shape of urban fields. Since these change constantly, urban 
            fields would change greatly over time accordingly. 
            f. The development of intervening alternative centres: Within the already existing urban 
            fields will tend to reduce the sizes of urban fields in fvaour of the new competing centres. 
            This is very visible when decentralization creates new administrative centres.  
            g. Psychological factor: There is a strong psychological factor in all human behavior and the 
            perception of the town by rural dwellers will be important in determining movement from 
            urban fields. As these perceptions change continuously, the shape and sizes of urban fields 
            will also change accordingly.

            TOPIC: SETTLEMENT NETWORKS 
            Lesson 14: Urban Hierarchy 
            A. Meaning 
            Hierarchy means organization into successive orders or grades. Settlement hierarchy is therefore 
            the organization into ranks and orders of towns and cities (urban hierarchy) and functions 
            (hierarchy of functions). The discussion of urban zones of influence will have made it clear that 
            the larger a city the wider it is likely to provide services. As a result, there has been a parallel 
            interest among geographers in the classification of cities according to the specialization of their 
            services. It is worth mentioning therefore that the concept of urban hierarchy goes beyond a mere 
            consideration of urban population sizes to include reference to the functions carried out by these 
            settlements. As such, it is expedient to give a focus on the concept of urban functions before 
            delving into any attempts at urban hierarchy. This hierarchy of settlements can be seen on the 
            figure below; 
            Figure: Hierarchy of settlements according to Size 
            B. Classification of urban functions 
            
            
            Human groupings into urban centres are to allow them carry out certain activities more 
            efficiently. These activities make up the functions of a town and they justify the reasons for the 
            continued existence of the settlement. Thus, the functions of a town are therefore considered as 
            “those activities which justify its existence and ensure the development of the area and which 
            bring in the resources necessary for its continued existence, growth and development”. They can 
            also be referred to as the activities carried out by an urban area which satisfies both its 
            inhabitants and the surrounding settlements. The following urban functions can be used to 
            classify urban settlements 
            a. Commercial (Trade or Market) Functions: These are the activities of urban areas that 
            make them serve as a place that facilitates exchange of commodities especially the purchase 
            and sale of local products as agricultural surpluses, consumer goods and durable goods as 
            agricultural equipment. Most urban centres started off for this function and were found lying 
            in densely populated districts or in agricultural regions. Some of the prominent examples of 
            such urban areas are; London, New York, Douala, Lagos, Abidjan, etc. 
            b. Industrial or manufacturing functions: Modern day urban centres are a product of the 
            industrial revolution especially as most early industrial activities of towns centered on 
            transformation of agricultural products and surpluses into manufactured goods for the 
            satisfaction of local needs. This manufacturing function stands out today as the greatest 
            accelerator of the development of urban centres. This is because it has widened the stream of 
            in-migrants rom rural areas for various reasons and pulled other subsidiary and ancillary 
            services as financial institutions, insurance and other support services. Examples of urban 
            centres under this category are; Leeds in UK, Chicago, Cleveland, Buffalo all in USA, 
            Liverpool in England, etc. 
            c. Mining functions: This is one of the oldest functions of towns and some towns built on this 
            function date 200 years or more. This function is prominent in towns that developed in areas 
            with an abundant of mineral resources that are readily exploited. Mining activities act as a 
            pull to other support or ancillary and subsidiary activities like metal smelting, refining and 
            engineering. Examples of towns with dominance of mining functions are; Falu (Zambia), 
            Lubumbashi (DRC), Jos and Enugu (Nigeria), etc. 
            d. Administrative or political Functions: These are towns largely concerned with the 
            governing, administration and organization of the society. They are thus capital cities or 
            centres of local administration. This role attracts to such areas government institutions, civil 
            
            
            service structures and headquarters, diplomatic services, superior courts and education 
            services. They have the best services of the country since they are symbols of national unity 
            and the window of the country to the world. Examples are; Yaounde (Cameroon), Berlin 
            (Germany), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Yamoussoukro (Ivory Coast), etc. 
            e. Residential and Dormitory Functions: The rapid development of urban areas and 
            industrial/or commercial functions has established housing problems. This has led to the 
            origin and growth in the 20th century of towns entirely reserved for housing or 
            accommodating the population that is largely gainfully employed outside than within them. 
            Examples include: Grassington (Britain), Beverly Hills around Los Angeles, etc. 
            f. Cultural and Education Functions: These are the traditional residences of monarchs (kings, 
            queens, sultans and their consort). They may have beautiful paqlaces and are visited by 
            foreign dignitaries. Good examples are; Foumban Palace in West region of Cameroon, 
            Copenhagen (Denmark), etc. Educationally, the conspicuous presence of universities and 
            other facilities like bookshops, libraries, museums, colleges, etc. turn to pull on thousands of 
            students from all over the globe that enter then annually and growth in their catering services 
            (teachers and clerical staffs, etc) has been responsible for their expansion. Examples of such 
            towns with world renounced universities aqre; St Andrews and Illinois (USA), Oxford, 
            Cambridge and London (UK), Heidelberg (Germany), etc. 
            g. Tourist and recreational Functions: Urban centres have over the years developed around 
            areas of great natural attraction as thermal and medicated springs as Spas towns during the 
            Roman Empire. Also the various categories of holiday resort towns are some of the blooming 
            urban centres of the world. Examples are; the coastal resorts for bathing and yatching as 
            Brighton in UK and Miami in USA. 
            h. Port functions: Ports are the landing places for steamers and river craft and usually have 
            deep waters, warehouses and international transport arrangements, including customs offices, 
            banking and insurance services,. This function is offered at diverse points and thus 
            settlements based on them have been classified into;  
             Seaports i.e. large ocean terminals with all the essential port facilities to accommodate 
            cargoes and passengers. e.g.  Kribi, Hong Kong, Southampton, Honolulu, etc. 
             Entrepôts i.e. ports that specialize I receiving and redistributing goods to the neighbouring 
            countries and to all corners of the world. e.g. Singapore, Colombo and Rotterdam. 
            
            
             Packet-stations i.e. they are ferry-terminals on an international scale which deal with goods 
            and passengers crossing channels and seas. e.g. Calais (France), Ostend (Belgium), etc. 
             Out ports i.e. these are smaller ports closer to deep ocean waters and serve a larger port 
            further inland which can no longer be reached by the largest ships. e.g. Lyttelton theat serves 
            Christchurch, Cuxhaven that serves Hambrug. 
             River ports i.e. these are ports that can be reached by smaller steamers on the lower course 
            of a river. Examples include; River Wouri in Douala (Cameroon), Onitsha on river Niger 
            (Nigeria), Mamfe on River Manyu (Cameroon) etc. 
             Fishing ports i.e. they have as main activity the handling of fish, with all related facilities as 
            storage, processing and packaging. Some prominent examples are; Yarmouth and Grimsby 
            (UK), Lorient (France), Bergen (Norway), Kula Besut (Malaysia), etc. 
            i. Fortress or Military Functions: Towns with this category of functions are not very 
            common today. Most medieval towns especially under the Roman Empire were established 
            for defensive purposes. Since this function is not a productive one and also because they 
            developed on difficult sites, most of the few such urban centres that have survived till date 
            have not grown up to very large centres. Some examples include; Chester, York and Lincoln 
            in England, and the “bastides” of southern France. 
            
            
            The Central Place Theory 
            A central place is an accessible location which provides goods and services for surrounding 
            areas. i.e. it renders central functions to surroundings settlements. A central place may vary in 
            size from a small village to a conurbation and forms a link in a hierarchy. The area around each 
            settlement which comes under its economic and political influence is referred to as its sphere of 
            influence and the extent of the sphere of influence will depend largely upon the spacing, size and 
            function of the surrounding central places. 
            Range and Threshold of Central Places 
            a. The range of a good: This is the maximum distance that people are prepared to travel in 
            order to obtain a particular god or service. In other words, the range of a good can be termed 
            “the outer limits of the market area” and this is why it is considered as the Sphere of 
            influence of the good. i.e. the area that comes under the economic, social and political 
            
            
            Y 
            influence of the good or service or where the traces of the good or service can be found. This 
            can be illustrated using the diagram below. 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Figure: An illustration of the range of a good or service 
            From the diagram above, it is seen that the range of the good or service is indicated by the radius 
            of the circle of the market area (line X-Y). it is closely related to cost of goods. Lower order gods 
            have less cost and so smaller range while higher order need a sufficiently large catchment. It 
            should be noted that all central places have lower outlets, but only few have higher order ones. 
            There are two types of range of a good or sphere of influence as follows; 
            i. Minimum range: This is the distance of the boundary needed to enclose the threshold 
            population for the outlet which provides it. 
            ii. Maximum range: It is the furthest distance measured in time and cost ove3r which either a 
            customer would be prepared to travel to obtain a good or service or a supplier travel to 
            provide it. Therefore, it is the maximum distance which people are prepared to travel in order 
            to obtain a particular good or service. 
            The range of a good or service is determined by the following factors; 
            1. Regularity and frequency of its distance: It has been observed that people are not prepared 
            to travel far to buy low-order items like salt, newspapers and groceries which they need 
            daily. This is because the transport cost would be greater when compared to the value but 
            they are rather prepared to go long distances to obtain higher-order items as furniture and 
            cars which they buy once in several years. It can therefore be concluded that goods that are 
            frequently bought have ranges while those less regularly bought have higher ranges. 
            2. The value of the good: The higher the value people attach to a function, the more prepared 
            they are to move over long distances to obtain it, thereby giving them wider ranges. 
            Conversely, for those which a less value is attached, they are less willing to move over a 
            longer distance to obtain them. 
            X 
            
            
            3. The length of the journey to be covered to obtain the good or service: The greater the 
            distance people are prepared or willing and able to cover in order to obtain a good and/or 
            service, the wider will be its range and vice versa. 
            b. The Threshold of a good: This indicates the minimum number of people required to support a 
            particular function. In other words, threshold value indicates the approximate size that a 
            settlement has to be before the entry of a particular function. It should be noted here that 
            threshold differs with function i.e. specialized functions like banks require greater number of 
            people and as such referred to as a high threshold function while low threshold functions like 
            barber, shoe mender, etc will require a few persons to support them. 
            Christaller’s Model of Central Place Theory 
            Walter Christaller (1893 – 1969) a German geographer published a book titled “Die Zentralen 
            Orte (Central Places) in Southern Germany” in 1933. In it he tried to develop a model that would 
            explain the spatial distribution of settlements and their hinterlands with larger settlements 
            forming central places to smaller settlements and smaller settlements forming hinterlands for 
            larger settlements.  
            His Principles 
            Christaller suggested that there was a pattern in the distribution and location of settlements of 
            different sizes and also in the ways in which they provide services to inhabitants living within 
            their sphere of influence. In order to arrive at this conclusion, he used two major principles as the 
            foundation of his theory. These are the concepts of: the threshold of the good and service (the 
            demand) and the range (quantity supplied) of the good and service. (See explanation of both 
            concepts above). 
            His Assumptions - That the area under study is unbounded and uniformly fertile and flat. Such a uniformity that 
            land is sometimes referred to as an isotropic surface. - That the population in it is uniformly distributed. - That all customers have uniform income (purchasing power) uniform taste and uniform 
            demand for goods and services. - That there is a single mode of transport available in all parts of the plain at a cost, which 
            increase, in direct proportion to the distance covered. - That every part of the plain is served by central places, provide goods, services and 
            administrative functions to the hinterlands. 
            
            - That customer’s visit the nearest central place that provide the goods or services which they 
            demand. They do this at a minimum distance (since goods and services are provided in all 
            directions). - That suppliers of good and services are all economic men that is they try to maximize their 
            profit by locating at points of greatest accessibility to customers and as ar away from one 
            another as possible. - He also assumed hexagonal market areas as the most efficient way of covering a plain with 
            no overlaps and no gaps. - Consumers manifest rational behavior and are considered as rational men. This means the 
            people minimize the distances which they travel in order to obtain a god or service. 
            The Three Patterns of Service Areas (the K-Value concept in the Central Place) 
            The K value is simply the number of other settlements which a central place is able to serve. 
            Christaller assumed that settlements serve as central places for goods and services and that 
            different goods and services have market areas of different sizes. It implies therefore that the k 
            value settlement must differ with size of the settlement. By arranging the hexagons in different 
            ways Christaller developed three (3) k values as follows; 
            a. The K-3 Value of Centre Places (The Marketing or trading Principle): In k-3 value, each 
            settlement is surrounded by six other settlements of the next grade down, situated at the 
            corners of the hexagonal market areas and on average would serve one third (1/3) of the 
            population of each series of the smaller settlements which is equidistant from three of the 
            next grade up. This settlement will serve the equivalence of three centres as seen below 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Since the central place has 6 dependent places in its border, the demand of all the six dependent 
            places would be 1/3 x 6 = 2. Since the demand in the central place is one unit, the total demand 
            from the dependent places and central places would be (6 x 1/3) = 2 plus all its own customers 
            
            
            (1). In total it therefore serves the equivalent of three central place (2+1) = k-3. Since each higher 
            order centre we can say it serves three times the whole trading area of the lower order centre. It 
            would also contain three times the population of the lower order centre. This implies further that 
            every one of the largest settlement there would be 3 of the second grade, 9 of the third grade, 27 
            of the fourth grade and so on. 
            b. The K-4 Value of Central Places (The Traffic or Transport Principle): He used the K-4 
            value to demonstrate the traffic principle which according to him, where the cost of 
            constructing traffic networks was more important, central places would be located on the 
            traffic principle. Here, the size of the hexagon is slightly larger and it has to be re-oriented. In 
            such a region, the central places lie along straight line paths between other centres as seen 
            below. 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Here, a lower centre is equidistant from only two higher centres. The higher order centre thus 
            serves a half of the population of six lower order centres (6 x ½) plus it own (1) giving four 
            in all (3 + 1) =  k-4. In the k=4 network the number of settlements serving as central places 
            would decrease in the power of 4, from 1 – 4 to 16 to 64, etc. Christaller called the k-4 the 
            traffic or transport principle. 
            c. The K-7 Value of Central Places (Administrative or Defensive Principle): In this system, 
            central places would be established according to the administrative (central government) 
            principle. The central place of each hexagonal area will have a total amount of demand from 
            each of its nearest dependent places. There is therefore a direct connection between a central 
            place here and all the dependent places. In this k-value, all dependent places are inside the 
            hexagon. Thus the central place receives from each of the six dependent places all demand 
            (1) making it 6 (i.e. 1 x 6 =6). So this is added one unit of demand from the central place 
            itself making it 7 (i.e. 6+1=7). Thus the higher order central places serves seven central 
            places (6+1). This is seen below 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Figure: K-7 value 
            The figure reveals that small market areas are set within larger market areas so that local 
            authority boundaries fit into regional authority boundaries. Christaller held that k-7 is the best 
            network for administration. 
            Christaller’s Conclusions - He observed that a hierarchy of settlements will result to indicate a differential combination 
            of goods and services provided in different places. - Christaller advanced that there was a spatial arrangements or hierarchy of central places in 
            their descending order of magnitude and emphasized that this was based largely on the size 
            of the settlement relative to the number of functions they perform and the number of 
            establishment they contain. - He also observed that a simple functional interdependence exist between the settlements in a 
            hierarchy. This means that settlements at the lower level depend functional on those of the 
            higher order for some specialized goods and services. - Each higher order settlement would provide all the facilities of the lower order settlements 
            together with some of its own specialized ones. i.e. the largest settlements in a region will 
            thus provide the largest number and the greatest variety of gods and services of all, while the 
            smallest settlements the least number and most limited variety. - He also advanced that the size of area 9zone of influence) served by the central place will 
            depend upon its order. This is such that the higher its order, the greater the area served. 
            
            
            Applicability of the Central Place Theory or model in Cameroon 
            Various aspects of Christaller’s central place theory have been tested in the settlement system 
            and urban functions of Cameroon with some degree of success. This is seen as follows; 
            a. Ordering of central places: Using the administrative principle of Christaller, towns 
            (administrative places) in Cameroon are classified into three order: - The first order towns which are the administrative headquarters of subdivisions and districts 
            and are up to 338 of them. These provide very few socio-economic functions and lower 
            administrative and legal functions. - The second order towns are the divisional headquarters and are 58 of them. It is worth noting 
            that some double as provincial capitals. In consequence they are larger in size and offer many 
            more functions and those of higher order than those that are mainly divisional headquarters. - The third order towns are provincial capitals. They offer administrative and legal functions of 
            the highest order and range. These towns are ten in number. 
            b. The distribution of central places in Cameroon 
            A close look at the map of spatial distribution of towns in Cameroon reveals a great degree of 
            unevenness. Urban centres are irregularly spread in three nuclei as follows; - The towns of the south forested zone that are widely spaced with Yaoundé, Ebolowa, 
            Mbalmayo and Sangmelima being the major ones. - The western region with a dense network of closely spaced urban centres. - The northern regions with pre-colonial towns as Maroua, Garoua and Ngaoundere that are 
            widely spaced. 
            c. The distribution of educational establishments 
             There is the dominance of primary schools: These services are found in all settlement 
            orders. Their great number is because they have lower threshold. Thus as they are lower 
            order functions, their range is low as people are not willing to move great distance to obtain 
            them. Thus small settlements as villages have primary schools. 
             Secondary and high schools are found in higher order settlements starting with sub 
            divisional capitals: Their numbers are fewer than primary schools and they are more widely 
            spaced. They require higher thresholds than primary schools and are high order enough to 
            pull students from a wider range. This threshold requirement and range for high schools is 
            even higher. They are generally in the order of one high school per sub division. This to 
            
            
            permit the maximization of the threshold student population that permits the secondary 
            schools to operate more efficiently. 
             Higher institution of learning (university and professional schools) are the fewest and are 
            mostly found in the highest order settlements as provincial capitals. They require the largest 
            student threshold and offer services whose range goes beyond the national frontier. This is 
            why universities are in Yaoundé, Buea, Bamenda, Douala, Dschang, Maroua and 
            Ngaoundere. They have the widest distances between them so as to maximize the threshold 
            student population. 
            Criticisms of Christaller’s Central Place Theory 
            Positive criticisms 
             It forms some fundamental thoughts on the spatial hierarchy of settlement. This is shown by 
            the number of articles coming out since his theory which strive at strengthening our 
            understanding of the forces that influence the distribution of urban places, their growth and 
            decline. 
             One vital contribution of the Christaller model to the understanding of settlement is the 
            emphasis it places on the concept of centrality. 
             His concepts of threshold and range of services and frequency of demand have been widely 
            used in many other studies out of settlement. For example threshold analysis was used by 
            planners of British new towns. 
             It helps in a clearer identification of the role of settlements as places of trade and exchange, 
            and extent to which this has influenced the nature of the settlement pattern in a region. 
             It is very applicable in rural development policies of LEDCs. This is used to slow down rural 
            depopulation and prevent rapid growth of major cities. 
             Though increased industrialization, mobility and specialization have rendered it less 
            satisfactory in the western industrialised parts of the world with time, it has been shown to be 
            applicable in rural societies such as the contemporary China in the 1960s and the distribution 
            of educational establishments in Cameroon. 
            Negative criticisms 
             Christaller’s isotropic surface cannot be applicable. This is because everywhere physical 
            differences exist from one place to another, thereby making it very rare for large areas of flat 
            land to exist. Also, people and wealth are not evenly distributed. 
            
            
             Furthermore perfect competition is unreal in the real world situation since some firms make 
            greater profits than others. 
             He assumed that the hinterlands of towns of similar specialization don not overlap and 
            consequently have a maximum distance. This is the range for the sales of any item produced 
            in town would prevail in all directions by same distance from that town’s centre. In reality, 
            overlapping hinterlands are the normal state of affairs in any country with well-developed 
            means of transport. 
             He also believed that services are provided solely from towns which were specially founded 
            as service centres. There are however industrial and mining towns and ports which began to 
            exist without providing services for the surrounding hinterlands but which developed this 
            functions later on. 
             Towns of equal size rarely share the same functions. Higher order central places do not 
            necessarily include all the same functions of lower order settlements. Also, the distribution of 
            settlements of the same order is less regular than what he assumed. 
             His landscape shows hinterlands being superimposed upon one another. This is criticized on 
            the grounds that it is difficult to devise a realistic pattern of communication that would fit an 
            arrangement of this nature. 
            
            Lesson 15: The Rank-Size Rule 
            A. Meaning and Formulae 
            The rank size rule is an attempt to find a numerical relationship between the population size of 
            settlements within an area such as a country or community. This empirical regularity was first 
            observed in 1913 by Auerbach. It only became pronounced between 1941 and 1949 by G.K Zipf 
            who popularized it and gave it a precise mathematical description. Since then the study has been 
            popularly called Zipf’s Rank Size Rule. This rule is stated 9described) as follows: - “if all the urban settlements (a set of towns) in an area region (country) are ranked in a 
            descending order of population sizes, the population of the nth town will be 1/nth that of the 
            largest”. - “if a set of towns in an area are ranked in descending order of population sizes, the 
            population of any given town will be inversely proportional to its rank in the list”. - “if all the urban settlements in an area are ranked in descending order of population, each 
            urban settlement will be inversely proportional to the number of urban settlements of the 
            
            
            similar proportion i.e. the larger the population of an urban settlement, the fewer will be the 
            number of such urban settlements in a region”. 
            Aims of the Rule - Find regularities concerning the characteristics o settlement in various countries. - Fit a graphical description to the size distribution of cities which will apply to the situation of 
            many countries. 
            Principle of the rule 
            The rule uses the sizes of population and plots them on a log scale. Thus Zipf maintained that in 
            any defined area, settlements are ranked in a descending order according to settlement size 
            depending on their population. 
            Presentation of the Rule 
            a. By formula 
            It has been expressed in the following formula 
            Formula (1)  𝑌=𝑋 
            Where x is the population of the largest town in the area and n the rank of the town whose 
            population is being calculated. 
            Formula (2) P1 = P1 x(1
            𝑟
            ) or Pr = P1.r-1 or Pn =PL ÷ n(or R) 
            Where P1 is the population of the largest or primate or city (city of rank 1); Pr the population of 
            city with rank r; Pn the population of the city; PL is the population of the primate city; and n(or 
            R) is the rank size of the city. 
            A town’s population therefore is derived by dividing the population of the largest city by the 
            town’s rank. 
            Example: If the largest city (rank 1) has a population of 2million, what would be the population 
            of the second largest town (rank 2)? 
            Solution 
            Pr = P1 x (1
            𝑟
            ) =P2 = 2,000,000 x ½  
            P2 = 1,000,000 people 
            Note: This procedure of calculation applies to all other ranks. 
            b. On Graphs: The relationship can be described in a graphical form by plotting a city’s rank 
            on the horizontal or X-axis as against its population on the vertical or Y-axis. This can be on 
            either an Arithmetical or Log Scale. When plotted on an Arithmetical graph, the ideal rank
            
            
            size distribution would appear as a steep, down ward-sloping smooth curve. It is however 
            common place for a Log Scale to be used for plotting the axes. The logarithms (base 10) of 
            both the population and the rank are plotted on a graph. The resultant plot is a straight line 
            sloping at an angle of 450. In order to obtain the log scale, the rank size rule formula is 
            rewritten as follows.  
            Log Pr = log P1 – Log r 
            In order to save time of looking up the logarithms from the table, special graph papers have been 
            constructed that have log scales on their axes. The ranks and populations can be plotted directly 
            on this and according to the rule a straight line then results. This is as seen below. 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Figure: The Rank-Size Rule and the Rank Size relationship for cities 
            Advantages of rank size rule - It saves time since it uses a special graph paper having log scale on its axis - It makes comparison of any country’s city size distribution easier than when it is plotted on a 
            normal (arithmetic) curve. This is because it converts the concave curve into a linear or 
            almost linear result.

            understanding. 
            Applicability and reasons  
            a. Applicability 
            Despite the changes overtime and the distortions, there are present day examples that approach 
            the theoretical rank-size rule. The following are some of the practical examples. 
            1. Colombia demonstrates the rank size rule. Bogota the largest city has a population of 
            1,662,000. This is approximately twice as large as Medellin (911,000), thrice the size of Cali 
            (618,000) and four times that of Barranquilla (493,000). 
            2. In Sweden, Stockholm has a population of 1.4 million people and Goteborg the second 
            largest town has a population of 700,000. Since the ratio of the first to the second largest 
            settlement is 2:1, then it fits the rank-size rule perfectly since the population of the second 
            large city is exactly half that of the first. 
            b. Reasons for the Rank Size Rule to Change - - - - 
            Decentralization of functions especially industrial and commercial activities. 
            Improvements in transport network. This causes redistribution of population and functions 
            The changes in population of cities. Over time, towns grow at different rates and so the 
            ranking of urban areas would change. The case of the USA stands out clear. 
            Political changes as changes in political status of towns, creation of new administration units. 
            B. Modification (Devistions) of the Rank Size Rule 
            Throughout time the numerous influences on settlement have changed to the extent that 
            identifying an area in the world conforming to the rule stands out as an exception than the norm. 
            The distortions are so great that even the cities of the USA that conformed to the lognormal 
            distribution at the inception of the rule now fall but under the exceptions to the rank-size rule. 
            Studies have identified three main patterns of urban settlements that are a deviation =, 
            modification, distortion or exceptions to the ideal rank-size rule. These have been called the 
            steppe, 
            and 
            below. 
            are 
            binary and primate patterns 
            illustrated on the diagram 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Figure: Hierarchy of settlement patterns (the rank size rule and its modifications). 
            Whynne concludes that “most regions have settlement hierarchies which approach one of these 
            three idealized linear progressions”. These modifications are hereby analysed as follows. 
            1. Stepped Pattern: It is a pattern in which similar settlements (of the same or almost the same 
            size) occupy one rank and are isolated from those of other ranks in the hierarchy of 
            settlements (i.e. below or above). Hence, instead of having a descending order of ranks in 
            relation to population size, there is a situation where many similar settlements occupy one 
            rank. Here, the regularly decreasing hierarchy of lognormal pattern is now distorted to a more 
            stepped order of settlement hierarchy where not one but a number of settlements may be 
            found at every level of the settlement network. This pattern is pattern lies very close to the 
            ideal rank-size pattern as the curve found on the lognormal pattern. The main difference is 
            that at each level instead of one settlement right form the highest several settlements exist. 
            Examples of this pattern are found in many areas of the world especially in federated states. 
            Conditions favouring the steppe pattern 
            a. Federal system of government: This enables each state in the federation to have its own 
            capital which is similar in size and function to other state capitals. In this example one can 
            find Germany, Australia, Canada, USA, Brazil and Nigeria. 
            b. New settled areas: In such areas, few cities exist and several towns are developing 
            simultaneously and at almost the same rate. This has been seen in Canada, Australia and 
            Brazil. 
            c. Rapid industrialization: This enables numerous industrial centres to take off in various 
            parts of the country. This factor justifies the earlier claim that the growth of mining and 
            manufacturing towns spreads urbanization. 
            d. Large size country: This gives the possibility of several towns developing simultaneously 
            across the country at different points. Good examples are USA, Australia, Germany and 
            Brazil. 
            
            
            e. Balanced regional development: As the different regions of the country grow at almost the 
            same rate, numerous towns develop at the growth poles. It is as a result of this factor that 
            many countries with the stepped pattern are NICs and those that have applied with much 
            success the growth pole concept of regional development. Good examples are Brazil, China 
            and India. 
            f. Decentralization of activities: This takes the form of decentralization of economic activities 
            and the administrative system. All these favour the growth of several urban centres across a 
            region at the same time. In Cameroon, many provincial, divisional and sub divisional 
            headquarters are of similar status (sizes) and are different from those above or below them. 
            g. Long history of urbanization: As the period of urban development increases, the numbers 
            of towns that develop becomes numerous. This explains why the stepped pattern is very 
            common in most countries of the old world Britain and Germany. 
            2. The Primate Pattern or the Concept of Urban Primacy: Urban primacy is a situation 
            where one town or city (primate city) far supersedes the rest of the towns in a country. In this 
            situation, the difference in size between the largest city and the other large cities is much 
            greater than predicted by the rank-size rule (lognormal distribution). Examples of primate 
            cities in the world include; London, Cairo, Mexico City, Santiago, Lima, Tokyo, Toronto, 
            Sydney, Kinshasa, etc. 
            
            Characteristics of primate city 
            Positive characteristics - It is normally a capital city (political or economic). - It has the finest goods (wares). - It has the most skilled workers in every science and art. - It has the highest economic and political institutions in the region. - It has the best transport system. 
            Negative characteristics - Acute housing shortages and so development of slums and ghettos, severe traffic congestion, 
            high crime wave, overcrowding, inadequate social services and high level of illiteracy. - High unemployment, urban and regional inequalities, escalating land prices. - High levels of congestion, pollution, acute problems of waste disposal, poor air quality, 
            contaminated water and soil. 
            
            - There is over concentration of power and decisions in it. 
            Reasons why urban primacy is predominant in LEDCs 
             Coincidence of economic and political functions 
             Poor development of transport networks 
             Dependence on agriculture for exports\ 
             Over-centralisation of economic activities 
             Over-centralisation of political activities 
             Simple colonial history 
             Small size countries 
             Low degree of urbanization 
             A short history of urbanization 
             Exceptionally conducive site and situations. 
            Consequences of the primate City or Urban primacy 
            Negative consequences 
             Urban and regional inequalities across a country: Since the primate city is the centre of 
            the core growth region (growth pole), it absorbs so much of the country’s investment and 
            attracts population and economic activities away from other regions, especially those in the 
            periphery. 
             Rural exodus: There is wide scale and rapid drifting of people from the suburbs and 
            countryside to the city centre where development is concentrated. This leads to depopulation 
            and deprivation of rural areqas. 
             Strain on national resources: More public funds are used in the development of the primate 
            city at the expense of the other regions of the country. Thus the already rich centre gets richer 
            while the poor centres become even poorer. 
             Political imbalance: There is over-concentration of political power in the primate city 
            compared with a lack of power elsewhere. For example, it has been observed that no 
            Libreville, no Gabon. This is due to the high concentration of all economic and political 
            activities in Libreville. 
             Urban sprawl to the country side: There is rapid expansion of the city and its influence into 
            surrounding areas. This is because population and activities either by choice or force move 
            from the inner city to the periphery. 
            
            
            Positive impacts - It permits economies of scale to be achieved. That is, since the city houses a significant 
            proportion of the country’s region’s population, it is more efficient and cheaper to provide 
            amenities to the people that are concentrated in the area rather than if they were spread out. - Since it houses the largest and most skilled work force, it is an industrial attraction and can 
            facilitate rapid growth of industries. - Since they have the best transport networks and economic facilities, they serve as “growth 
            poles” from where development trickles down to other regions of the country. 
            3. The Binary Pattern: It is a pattern of urban hierarchy in which two or more very large 
            towns which are either at par or slightly different occupy the top of the hierarchy and 
            dominates all other towns in the country. Thus in this case, it is more common for two towns 
            to occupy the top most position among towns in the country when towns are arranged in irder 
            of importance or rank-size. For example, Yaoundé and Douala in Cameroon, Nairobi and 
            Mombasa in Kenya, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo in Brazil, etc. 
            Conditions (factors) favouring the development of the binary pattern 
            a. Large size countries with federal systems of government: Each territory within federation 
            has its own regional capital city. These towns of similar sizes then dominate the top of the 
            hierarchy. Good examples are in Nigeria and Canada. 
            b. A recently settled area: In this area settlement development is still at infancy. This is the 
            case of Australia, Canada and Brazil. In this there is need to expand transport systems from 
            the coast into the hinterland. Thus a prominent town grows in the interior to match up with 
            the coastal metropolis. 
            c. Separation of the political and economic capitals: This leads to the cities to grow rapidly 
            to dominate the top of the settlement hierarchy. This is the case of Yaoundé and Douala in 
            Cameroon where there has been division of function between the two cities. 
            Comparison of the Central Place Theory and Rank-Size Rule 
            a. Differences - The central place theory focuses on the regularity of the size hierarchy within a settlement 
            system and the regularity in its spatial pattern while the rank-size rule is concerned only with 
            the size relationship. - The central place theory focuses on functional relationships while the rank-size rule uses but 
            size (population) relationships. 
            - - - - - 
            The central place theory holds that a theoretical regularity (based on normative assumptions) 
            whereas the rank-size rule is an empirical regularity 9that is based on actual observations). 
            The central place theory holds that findings are dynamic in space and time whereas the rank
            size rule considers conditions to be unchanging. 
            The size hierarchies (rank-size rule) ranks the largest settlement as first, but functional 
            hierarchies (ranking of settlement by function), ranks first the settlement with largest market 
            area (by having the largest shops for example, the most specialized services or the most 
            dominant financial organization). 
            b. Similarities 
            They all attempts at arrangement of settlements in order of decreasing importance. 
            They all arrive at the conclusion that there is a fewer number of larger settlements and a 
            greater number of small settlements in any distribution.  
            TOPIC: URBAN MORPHOLOGY 
            Lesson 16: Structure of the City in the MEDCs 
            A. Urban Morphology and structure 
            i) 
            Urban morphology 
            Urban morphology refers to the layout of the buildings together with the functions whereas urban 
            structure refers to the spatial relationship between the functional zones (morphological zones). 
            Urban morphology generally refers to the streets, building blocks, individual buildings, their 
            different functions, densities and lay-out. 
            Components of the urban landscape 
            a. Streets: This examines the past and present plans established by transport route networks. 
            From examination, it has been established that differences exist in the arrangement of streets 
            between old and new towns. i.e. in old towns, the layout of streets is usually haphazard. This 
            is because routes branch off at varied angles from each other. in towns which have expanded, 
            the “old core” or “old hearts” tend to reflect this, except where massive urban renewal efforts 
            have been carried out. Some good examples are “old town” in Bamenda, Briqueterie and 
            Grand Mesa in Yaounde. In the new towns, the layout of streets is better. This is because 
            more attention has been devoted to the planning and building of their streets and houses. 
            
            
            Thus the arrangement of streets and the subsequent construction of buildings is therefore 
            very significant in determining the overall plan or appearance of the town or city. 
            b. The Buildings: These are the houses and their arrangement is in line with the layout of 
            streets. Generally, the buildings face the streets and buildings of a particular sections of the 
            town. This is to the extent that the town can be carved into zones by building characteristics. 
            It should be noted that unlike streets, buildings are subject to alterations overtime through 
            clearance, renewal and rehabilitation, in relation to changes in population and improvement 
            in transport networks. This mostly happens when they become unsafe and unprofitable and 
            so need replacement by those that are new and suitable for changing conditions. 
            c. Functions: these are the roles played or benefits offered by the streets and the buildings in 
            the town. Functions influence the visibility of the buildings. This is most noticeable if they 
            are specially designed for their purpose. The most remarkable aspect about urban functions is 
            that they are segregated.  
            ii) Structure of the inner city 
            a. The city centre 
            Definition: It is essentially “the core (hub) of the city business and civic life, and exhibits 
            distinct physical and human features which distinguish it from all surrounding areas. (whynne-H, 
            1988). It can also be referred to as the “zone of the city which is the centre for retailing, office 
            location and service activities i.e. it forms the core of a city’s business and commercial activities. 
            (Waugh 2002). In the USA, it is called “The Central Business District” (CBD). 
            Characteristics of the CBD 
            1. It has the greatest accessibility in the whole urban system: This is the CBD’s greatest 
            feature. This is because of the existence of the numerous lines of public transport converging 
            on it as their focal point. 
            2. It has the highest land values in the city: It occupies the peak land value intersection point 
            (PLVIP) due to its great accessibility. This makes it very attractive as potentials for very high 
            profits. This has induced very intense competition between land uses for this locational zone 
            and has pushed up land values to the highest (highest land rent). 
            3. It is the commercial hub with major and diverse major retailing outlets: there is thus the 
            concentration of departmental stores, variety good stores with specialist retail outlets as well 
            as some convenience shops with highest turnover and needing high accessibility. The high 
            accessibility attracts those retail outlets which provide goods and services with a very 
            
            
            extensive range and large threshold population and depend on customers drawn up from 
            catchment area. 
            4. There is a concentration of offices: Large cities contain principal regional or even head 
            offices of a number of companies which must be accessible to as many potential clients as 
            possible. Thus it has a high proportion of the city’s main offices. A central location also 
            makes it easier for offices to assemble their labour force drawn from middle class workers 
            who often live in peripheral suburbs location. 
            5. Absence of manufacturing industries: Only few specialized manufacturing exist as the 
            publication of periodical newspapers which need speed in production distribution and 
            immediate access to contributors, illustrations and photographs and relevant services. It is 
            only the CBD that can meet up with these requirements. 
            6. There is low residential population: There is no substantial area of residential 
            accommodations due to high land values. Commerce dominates while certain functions as 
            residential population are virtually excluded. As a result of this low residential population, 
            the city centre has often been described as the “Dead Heart of City”. This is very visible at 
            night especially after midnight when all businesses and most entertainment have closed down 
            for the day. 
            7. It has the highest volume and concentration of pedestrians: This is the result of the 
            already discussed characteristics of the heart of the city. Thus it has the highest pedestrian 
            flow in the whole urban system. This is due to the attractions of a variety of commercial 
            outlets and service. 
            8. This zone undergoes constant evolution: In fact the area is one of great dynamism with its 
            activities and components continuously undergoing redevelopment changes in both 
            morphology and in social patterns so as to meet mutations in economic conditions. It is 
            therefore a zone of comprehensive redevelopment since the inner city zones experience great 
            application of slum clearance and subsequent renewal initiatives. 
            The internal structure of the City-Core (CBD) 
            This examines the layout of the different land uses i.e. functions and activities competing for 
            space within the CBD. Land uses within this part of the city show a tendency towards an 
            ordered arrangement. This has been largely determined by the pattern of land values around 
            the CBD. The pattern of land uses however is not very definite as studies into land uses 
            patterns within the CBD has revealed that the concentric and quartered land use zoning 
            
            
            patterns are very visible in the CBD land use. The following can be identified as seen on the 
            table below.

            Man, London, 1972. 
            Evolution of the CBD 
            A major feature of the CBD is its dynamism. It is worth noting that as the town grows, the CBD 
            expands around the city core, frequently extending far away along the main access routes into the 
            centre. Within the CBD, detailed internal adjustments are taking place and incude; - Shifts in limits: The boundaries of the CBD are subject to gradual locational shifts in 
            relation to changing economic conditions. The boundaries are either expanding (advancing) 
            or contracting (retreating). This constitute the zone of assimilation (i.e. areas into which a 
            CBD is growing and are characterised by extensive redevelopment and rising land values) 
            and the zone of discard (i.e. areas found around the edge of the CBD frame, from which the 
            CBD has moved away and are characterized by low-grade retail stores, warehouses and 
            wholesale, trading premises, etc.). - Changing land uses: The dominance of retail and office and administration in the CBD is 
            quite recent. In the earlier times, the CBD was a district of varied land-uses with residential, 
            commercial, administrative and even industrial complexes were mixed together. But as time 
            went on, the rising value of land and property in the CBD forced out most of the residential 
            and industrial land uses leaving a district having a dominance of retail trade premises, offices 
            and institutional buildings. - Changes in building: There have been significant changes in the building types. Due to 
            increasing cost and shortage of land in the city centre, older buildings of one or two storey 
            have increasingly been replaced by new multi-storey developments. This has given rise to 
            skyscraper blocks in some of the largest cities as New York and Tokyo. 
            - - 
            The growth of offices: A reverse trend has been observed in the administrative function. 
            There has been a sharp growth in the space occupied and income generated by offices, banks 
            and insurance companies. There has thus been a sharp rise of office blocks within the CBD in 
            recent times especially those of capital cities. 
            Rise in peripheral growth: In recent years, continued growth of the CBD is at the periphery 
            (frame) while the inner core is on a decline. Thus a number of common CBD usages have 
            found it more convenient and profitable to relocate outside the CBD. This leaves the inner 
            core strictly for the highest profit making concerns, such as banks and other financial 
            institutions and large departmental stores. 
            Problems of the CBD and their Solutions 
            1. The development of “dead hearts” within the CBD and their defects on social and economic 
            life forms: The most important part of the solution has been that the problem has been 
            recognized by politicians and urban planners. Here, numerous planning initiatives have been 
            designed for the inner core geared at attracting population back into the inner city areas. 
            2. The rapid growth of offices in the centre of many towns and cities has resulted in exorbitant 
            rises in land values and the expansion of the CBD into surrounding areas: The consequence 
            is the enlargement of “the dead heart” of the city. This is because older housing in once 
            peripheral areas are pulled down and replaced by office “blocks”. As a solution, initiatives of 
            inner city planning have been stepped up especially functional zoning. 
            3. Congestion: The pride of the CBD is its great accessibility. This feature inherent in the CBD 
            is today being threatened by rising traffic congestion. There is increasing difficulty of travel 
            within it, thereby reducing the attractiveness of the CBD. This has been solved by transport 
            improvement schemes especially pedestrianisation. 
            4. Limited space: The spatial spread of the CBD has been restricted by physical barriers as 
            rivers, ocean, marshes, land liable to floods and steep slopes. These are obstacles to the 
            development of communication lines. Also, urban relics have obstructed the expansion of the 
            CBD. This is because some old houses cannot be easily converted to handle the modern 
            demands of CBD functions. The main solution has been the intensification of urban renewal 
            schemes. 
            5. The CBD is under intense competition threats with the recent upsurge of suburban 
            superstores and hypermarkets: These suburban retails supply convenient and durable goods 
            
            
            and so compete with departmental store, variety food store and specialist stores that cluster in 
            the CBD. 
            6. The CBD also suffers from high costs: this include that of land, pollution, a lack of site, 
            planning restrictions and strict government control. 
            Delimitation of the CBD (Field Techniques) 
            The greatest challenge to the study of the CBD remains the carving out of its real limits. This is 
            especially as today the term CBD and transitional zone surrounding it has been widened and 
            considered to cover the “core” where CBD usages dominate and a “frame” where CBD usages 
            are present but do not exceed half the total land use. Due to this, the following techniques are 
            used: 
             The rent or rate Index: R.E. Murphy and J.E Vance Jr. were the first in this direction and 
            suggested the use of land values. They held that land valuation data could provide the most 
            objective and widely applicable method of delimiting the CBD. They based their studies on 
            the pattern of decline of land values outwards from the core of the CBD in nine American 
            cities. They observed that a land valuation of 5% of the peak land value corresponded very 
            closely with the extent of the CBD based upon land use patterns. That the core of the CBD 
            had the highest land value and the edge of the CBD is indicated by the point where land 
            values drop 5% that of the core of CBD. This technique has been applied to non-American 
            cities. 
             Pedestrian Flow Index: This measures the number of people passing a given point at a 
            given time. Normally, the highest pedestrian flow is at the CBD with the number petering 
            down away from the CBD. 
             Traffic Flow and Parking Zones Techniques: This measures the number of cars passing a 
            given point within a given time period and also the amount of ground space devoted to 
            parking lots for cars. Generally, the CBD are restricted parking zones and so the parking 
            space is always limited. It however has the highest traffic flow rate in an urban system since 
            it has high concentration of traffic owing to its high accessibility. 
             The Central Business Index (CBI): It is the most recent technique and has been lauded as 
            the best likely technique. This is because it involves the combination of land use 
            characteristics notably building heights and land values. Two indices are derived as follows: - The Central Business Height Index (CBHI): This is expressed in the following formula 
            
            
            �
            �𝐵𝐻𝐼=𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝐶𝐵𝐷 𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠
            𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 
            If the CBHI value of a plot is greater than 1, the area is considered as part of the CBD but if 
            less than 1, it is not. - The Central Business Intensity Index (CBII): It is expressed in the following formula 
            �
            �𝐵𝐼𝐼=𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝐶𝐵𝐷 𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠
            𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 ×100 
            If the CBII value of a plot is greater than 50%, then the zone is part of the CBD. But if less 
            than 50% it is marked out. It should be noted that the two indices are often combined to draw 
            a conclusion on whether an area is part of the CBD or not. 
            
            b. The inner city 
            This is the area near the city centre which is densely populated and which contains dilapidated 
            housing, often in multiple occupations. The inner city is characterized by a declining industrial 
            and economic base, higher rates of unemployment than the city as a whole and recent loss of 
            population. It is often a reception area for immigrants. It is the zone of urban decay and so has 
            the most extensive renewal works. It should be mentioned here that this inner city has been 
            widening as suburbanization of the wealthier households spreads in to the surroundings area. 
            
            
            c. The transitional zone 
            This surrounds the CBD and separates the city centre from the periphery. In the past, it was 
            characterized by housing and industry, as working class neighbourhoods grew up next to the 
            factories. But since the last decade of the 20th century, it was observed that it tended to be more 
            diversified. In this zone now are found commercial activities spilling over from the CBD, as well 
            as some vacant plots and derelict sites which await redevelopment. In recent times, there has 
            been the addition of multi-storey car parks and temporary car parking on vacant ground to serve 
            the needs of workers, shoppers and others who use the nearby CBD. 
            d. The Suburbs 
            See the next section of the chapter 
            e. Fringe Belt 
            
            
            This is a belt-like zone which originates from the temporarily stationary or very slowly 
            advancing fringe of a town. It is composed of a characteristics mixture of land use units initially 
            seeking a peripheral location. The development of fringe belts, as an urban zone is the result of 
            the distinctive character of each morphological period. The contributions of each morphological 
            period to fringe developments especially the transport innovations which contributed to them 
            have been built into a simple model by Whiteman. 
            B. Main Function Zones (Spatial organization of functions) 
            1. Commercial or Retail Activities: Retail activities constitute a major component of the 
            modern economy and a major source of city employment. In Europe it accounts for close to 
            15% of the GDP of most countries. These retail activities have been monopoly of the inner 
            cities until lately. Hence the CBD remains the central shopping area for the entire city as it 
            contains the highest order or retail activities. The hierarchical arrangement of shopping 
            centre is linked to two factors i.e. threshold and range of goods/services. 
            2. The service sector within cities: Service are intangible goods rendered for which a reward is 
            given. Thus they are invisible items which help in the production process. They constitute 
            aspects of the tertiary sector. In terms of particular locations within the inner city, they have 
            tended to concentrate in places different from the old centres of manufacturing. Generally, 
            services are grouped together into central places which are hierarchically arranged in terms 
            of services offered. It is generally held that places with larger populations offer a wider 
            variety of services than smaller places. 
            3. Industrial (Manufacturing) Activities within cities: Unlike retailing whose presence is 
            very significant in all cities, the importance of manufacturing activities varies greatly with 
            cities. It is almost non-existent in some towns while in others it dominance over other 
            functions has earned such cites the appellation of industrial cities or manufacturing centres. 
            The location of industries throughout an urban area may fall into a set pattern and industries 
            tend to cluster due to factors such as; to derive mutual economic benefits, may have same 
            sitting requirements, planning policies, etc. It should however be noted that spread of 
            industries in cities of the MDCs is different from that of the LEDCs. 
            4. Residential Zones or Housing Land use pattern: The residential function generally 
            accounts for the largest single land use area in any city. In spite of its dominance, it has been 
            observed that there is a certain arrangement of residential land use in the city as it is expected 
            that from the city centre to the suburbs, different types of residences exist and also has 
            
            
            different categories of people. The three main residential zones are; The CBD residential belt 
            (i.e. the few dwellings within the CBD with unique character and small population), the inner 
            city residential district (i.e. the zone which often forms part of the “blighted” or “slum zone” 
            surrounding the CBD), and the suburban housing zone (i.e. the suburban fringes). 
            Reasons for the uniformity in housing style and social class in the suburban 
            residential zone - Increased flexibility of movements and had favoured sorting out of social groups - Urban planning policies i.e. planning rules about land use zoning and housing densities have 
            encouraged the trend towards uniformity. - New architectural designs and urban redevelopment styles. 
            Reasons for the rapid growth in suburban housing - Rapid growth in urban population. This is the underlying factor since the population has 
            spread out into the urban fringe. - Social changes. Changes such as continuous reduction in family and household units, change 
            in mentality, the trend of human choice. A host of these changes have magnified the impact 
            of urban population growth. - The developments in communication. - Government policy.  
            Factors of Urban Land use changes - Changes in population and wealth - Changes in transport routes - Changes in the cultural habits of the population - Government policy of urban planning 
            Lesson 17: Factors Affecting Functional Segregation      
            Urban value is the measure of the degree of economic importance attached to a given area in city 
            by the different urban and land uses. This importance expressed in monetary terms would be 
            called land rents or economic rent. Thus, economic rent is the amount an urban activity is 
            prepared to and able to pay for a given zone in the city for its location. It also refers to the price 
            of land in an urban area. 
            A. The Bid-Rent (Land Value) Theory of Ratcliff 
            The study of urban land values indicates that many factors intervene. This has led to the 
            development of a theory that seeks to explain the variation in land value system. The final 
            
            
            version of this theory propounded by Ratcliff today has evolved over the years and considered 
            the most reliable.  
            a. Aim  
            The main objective of the theory is to provide an explanation for the spatial pattern of urban land 
            uses or to explain the reaction of functions in a town or city in terms of economic factors. 
            b. Assumptions - Accessibility determines land values and consequently bid rent. This therefore means that the 
            higher the level or degree of accessibility, the higher the bid rent and vice versa. - Land use is determined by the relative efficiency of using the land in different ways in a 
            particular location. This implies that the final occupation of any site is obtained by the 
            function that uses the site most efficiently i.e. derives the greatest profits and so are able to 
            pay highest for it. - There no influence of physical factors indicating that only human factors were considered. - There is no government intervention implying that only economic competition determines 
            urban land use. 
            c. Principle  
            The model uses the concept of “Bid Rent”. In this light, bid rent has been defined as: “it is the 
            value of land for different purposes such as commercial, manufacturing and residential 
            activities”. It also refers to “the price offering ability of the different urban activities (retail, 
            industry and housing) for different urban sites”. 
            The model is based on the fact that different parts of the urban landscape have different degrees 
            of accessibility. This has induced intense competition between the different urban land uses for 
            these urban land spaces with different degrees of accessibility. Land at the CBD has the highest 
            economic importance because its central location gives it the greatest accessibility to public 
            transport, thus attractive to all categories of land uses and also the most competitive for by all the 
            activities. This has resulted in it being the most expensive portion of urban land zone, a situation 
            accentuated by the fact that at the CBD land is short in supply. Since the degree of accessibility 
            decreases with increasing distance from the city centre to the periphery, the demand for land by 
            other functions decreases. The following graph shows the arrangement of various categories of 
            urban land use based on the ability to pay rent:

            and at a constant rate from the city centre. 
            Distortions of the Simple Bid-Rent Pattern 
            1. The development of communication networks: The smooth decline of urban land values 
            from the CBD to the periphery is affected by the spatial arrangement of transport networks. 
            Land values are higher along roads radiating from the CBD, road junctions an route terminals 
            as railway stations, motor pars, sea and river ports, etc. The consequence of this is that the 
            pattern of urban land values looks like an irregular tent or cone with a peak at the centre. 
            Thus localized peaks occur at route junctions and in areas with some particular advantage or 
            amenity. 
            2. The creation of subsidiary shopping centres at out-of-town locations: These out of town 
            shopping cnetres though found at the periphery tend to have higher land values around them. 
            This has distorted the simple bid-rent pattern because it causes land rents and values to 
            increase towards the periphery instead of decreasing. 
            
            
            3. The quantity of land available: This may also distort the pattern in the sense that some 
            functions may be pushed by land scarcity to choose less favourable sites so as to have large 
            spaces. This is the case of industries and low class residences choosing marches because of 
            need for space. 
            4. Socio-economic factors: Sometimes, wealthy families may choose to live near the city 
            centre while others may choose to live at the periphery. This is indicative of the fact that it is 
            not only the rent paying ability that counts but also an element of human choice free will. 
            There is also an element of the satisfier concept in that those who sell and buy urban space 
            may not be motivated by maximum profit. Thus they would not seek for the optimum 
            locations for their activities. 
            5. Individual taste and preferences: These determine how land user spent their disposable 
            income. In this case the amount spent on land and travel cost as a proportion of what is spent 
            on all goods and services. Some will chose to devote a higher proportion of their disposable 
            income on travel cost in order to secure advantages of sub urban environment. 
            6. Historical factor: this is seen in the influence of past cultural factors which caused the 
            development of low class residential quarters (shanty towns) at the periphery. These often 
            provide a historical framework within which modern urban differentiation occurs. 
            7. Government action: The bid rent pattern originates largely under situations of free economy 
            where competing market forces rather than central planning largely determines urban land 
            use. in recent times even in western capitalist countries the urban land bidding process has 
            been greatly distorted by the increasing role of municipal and government authorities in 
            planning the location of urban land use activities. This influence is seen through actions as 
            the compulsory purchase of inner city land and decision to build large council estates. 
            Major characteristics of the Bid-rent Theory 
            i) Efficiency in land use: The theory presupposes that at any location the land is occupied 
            and used by the function that derives the highest utility from it. Consequently, this 
            activity can pay highest for the site. 
            ii) Functional organization: The bid rent theory gives the following sequence of 
            organisation of land users (functions): from commercial (retail to wholesaling), to offices 
            (administration), manufacturing (industrial), housing (residential) and farming 
            (agricultural). 
            iii) 
            iv) 
            Reliance on transport networks and accessibility: Bid rent theory works not just from 
            the city centre (PLVIP) but also from SPLVIP. Thus, it assumes that accessibility 
            determines land values. As such, bid rent is expected to be higher along major lines of 
            communications (especially roads) than away from such routes. 
            No government interference: It assumes that there is no government interference 
            (planning) and that land around the city is an isotropic plain. The other assumptions upon 
            which the theory is based and its criticisms is very similar to those of the Burgess Model. 
            Bid-Rent Profiles 
            1. The very steep bid-rent gradient or profile portrayed by retail functions: Commercial 
            activities of retail receive the highest rents at the central locations than all other activities. 
            they are prepared and able to pay highest for the location because of their great need for 
            accessibility. The very steep gradient or profile indicates that the rents received by retail fall 
            very sharply with increasing distance from the CBD. The reason for this profile is that as 
            distance increases towards the periphery, the degree of accessibility declines. Since retail 
            activities depend highly on accessibility the sites become increasingly less profitable and 
            they are thus unwilling to pay for the high rent. Thus their profitability, ability and 
            willingness to pay for sites away from the city centre reduces very sharply that just within a 
            few kilometres from the CBD, retail cannot be economically located.

            Distance 
            2. The steep bid-rent gradient for warehouses, wholesale and offices (administration): This 
            gives a situation in which the bid rent gradient declines relatively fast from the CBD towards 
            the periphery. The activities of wholesale, warehousing and offices need great threshold 
            population of the city centres, a certain degree of accessibility and need to be near the retail 
            
            
            activities that they support. Thus even though they are not located at the city centre they must 
            be close to it. Hence as distance increases from the CBD, there is a sharp drop in both the 
            threshold population and accessibility. This reduces the profit margin for these activities 
            thereby causing them to be unable and unwilling to pay for sites further away from the city 
            core.

            3. The gentle gradient for light industries and low class residential functions: This is a 
            situation where the ability to pay rents for urban spaces declines quite slowly with increasing 
            distance towards the periphery. Even though these activities cannot afford to pay the high 
            city centre rents and also need relatively low accessibility, they need not to be too far from 
            the CBD. This is because this proximity to the CBD permits the light industries to take 
            advantage of the technical skills or pool of labour at the CBD, whereas the low class 
            residential functions here provides cheap housing to poor inner city dwellers and reduce their 
            transport cost to and from work in the inner city.

            4. Very gentle bid-rent gradient for heavy industries, high-class residential functions and 
            agricultural purposes: The decline of bid rents with increasing distances from the CBD is 
            very slow that it is almost negligible. These activities require the least accessibility and 
            threshold population. Thus their ability to pay for distant plots from the city heart is very 
            high that as distance into the periphery increases their ability and willingness to pay for sites 
            remains almost unchanged.

            Why Various Urban Activities have different Bid Rent Curves 
            a. Variation in accessibility requirements: The different urban functions need different 
            degrees of accessibility. Retail activities need the highest followed by wholesale and offices, 
            industrial, residential and agriculture in this order. It is logical therefore that activities 
            needing high accessibility should be willing and able to bid highest for the most accessible 
            central location while those with reducing accessibility requirement should progressively 
            occupy land with low bid rents towards the periphery. This explains why retail activities 
            occupy the CBD with high but very sharply declining bid rent curves. 
            b. Variations in rents paying ability: Even though most urban functions desire central 
            locations, they are limited by their ability to pay the cost of such sites. Due to the very high 
            need for accessibility by commercial activities than other activities, they are willing and able 
            to pay for the very high land values at and near the CBD. The industrial, residential and 
            urban agricultural activities that have lower rent paying abilities are out bided at the central 
            locations and are compelled to occupy progressively peripheral locations in this order. 
            c. Difference in threshold requirement: Different urban activities need various levels of 
            support population or threshold. Generally, the threshold population declines from the CBD 
            to the periphery. Activities that need high thresholds as the commercial functions are willing 
            RESIDENTIAL Offer Price 
            (Bid Rent) 
            
            
            and able to pay highest for high threshold locations at and near the CBD. As the threshold 
            drops their rents paying will drop sharply thereby giving them very steep to steep bid rent 
            profiles. On the other hand, industrial, high-class residential and farming activities need low 
            support population. Thus they have low desires for central locations as reflected by the low 
            bid rents they are prepared to offer such locations. 
            d. Variations in space needs: Urban functions differ in their space requirements. Activities as 
            retail that require little spaces tend to be willing and able to pay and locate on smaller but 
            expensive spaces at central locations. On the other hand, activities as heavy industry and 
            residential that require vast pieces of land are willing to pay less for the expensive limited 
            central locations. Rather they are willing and able to pay more rents than commercial 
            activities for the vast land pieces towards the periphery. 
            B. Impacts of Bid rent Variations on City Structure 
            1. Functional segregation: This is the tendency for certain functions to cluster and dominate or 
            be more conspicuous in certain urban zones. Due to variations in rents bidding abilities of 
            various urban functions, from the CBD to the periphery functions with steeper bid rent 
            profiles are progressively substituted for those with gentler gradients. The results is a 
            functional zoning in the order of retail, wholesale, and offices, industrial and residential. This 
            pattern appears to hold also along route axes or arteries, junctions and termini. Thus, it can be 
            concluded that “variations in bid rents reflects the substitution of urban land uses”. 
            2. Concentric arrangement of land use zones: Since the bid rent analysis assumes that there is 
            an isotropic surface around a single CBD, bid rents would vary in the same manner in all 
            directions from the CBD. Consequently, in urban areas having firm and fairly uniform relief 
            and drainage conditions, land uses would radiate in concentric zones away from the CBD 
            towards the periphery in all directions. Burgess held that each zone would differ from the 
            other in terms of functions; age and housing type. 
            3. A variation in land value: Variation I the need for accessibility has induced a decline in the 
            urban land surface from the CBD to the periphery. Even though the smooth decline is 
            interrupted along routes arteries and their intersection points, the general trend is a decline. 
            This is because land values at these SPLVIP are not as high as at the CBD (PLVIP). 
            4. A hierarchical arrangement of urban functions: As a result of bid rent differential 
            between and within functions, hierarchies have developed in commercial, industrial and 
            residential activities in cities. 
            
            
            5. Variations in the manner of urban land use: The different urban values have induced 
            varying ways of utilization of land spaces in a bid to maximize returns on every square metre 
            of urban land. It is observed that the more expensive land near the city centre is very 
            intensively used. This is reflected in a very common phenomenon of towering towards 
            buildings which has extended land use vertically. 
            C. General Factors Explaining the Functional Segregation in Towns 
            a. Economic factors 
             Bid rent: This refers to the amount a function is willing and able to pay on a site higher 
            enough to outbid other competing functions. This is because it is able to derive the greatest 
            profit on it. This is one of the most important economic factor responsible for the segregation 
            of functions in many cities today. This competition process of bidding and out bidding for 
            sites leads to different functions occupying separate urban zones. 
             Accessibility or transport network development: Accessibility refers to the degree to 
            which it is easy to reach an area, in this case the different part of the urban landscape. The 
            significance of this factor is that it represents a saving on transport cost made at each urban 
            location. This is because site rents represent savings on transport cost in overcoming the 
            frictional effects of distance. The most accessible areas reduce transport cost and so possess 
            the highest values and consequently command the highest rents.  
             Other economic factors: The reduction of transport cost and savings of energy and time is 
            closely related to accessibility concept. Transport costs are greatly minimized when similar 
            activities are located in the same area. This concentration eases accessibility and raises the 
            level convenience for users of such functions. Related to this is the interdependence of 
            functions. Functions of the same type gain greater profitability by locating in close 
            proximity. This is because it permits economies of scale to be enjoyed through attracting a 
            large threshold and carrying out joint ventures. 
            b. Social and cultural factors 
            Human behavior causes people from same culture, language, ethnic composition to congregate. 
            This has caused the urban landscape to be segregated into unique zones based on social 
            relationship. This is mostly manifested in the sense that some wealthy families choose to live in 
            the city cenetre while others equally choose to live in the periphery on the edge of the city. Also, 
            
            
            high class and low class residences tend to be in separate zones occupied by people of different 
            social groups. 
            c. Government policy of town planning 
            In a bid to give the town an organised or orderly look, urban planning authorities may 
            deliberately designate particular areas for specific functions. This may be a large or small-scale 
            effort through legalization or laws that has enabled the government to undertake the grouping of 
            identical functions together. These activities precipitate functional segregation. Many examples 
            of this exist in all parts of the world. For example in Cameron, the government constructed high 
            class residential areas in many towns for middle and top civil servants. These constituted what is 
            called the Government Residential Areas (GRA). 
            d. Physical features 
            A close look at the spatial organization within urban areas reveals that the varied nature of its 
            physical landscape especially the site constraints have always played an important role in the 
            spatial segregation of functions. Different activities tend to occupy hills, valleys, marshy ground, 
            low lying and dry land and shoreline areas, thereby inducing a functional segregation across the 
            townscape. Generally, commercial activities are attracted to flat well drained land while high 
            class residential zones have a tendency to be attracted to relatively well drained areas of high 
            relief. Conversely, low class residential zones and some industrial activities cluster within broad 
            valleys, plains and marshy and cheap areas. 
            e. Historical accident 
            An examination of the evolution of cities reveals that there is a tendency for similar functions to 
            group together. This might have been the result of design or mere chance. Thus different areas 
            were attributed to specific function and thus needing no other dividing. This was merely to 
            provide the townscape an orderly appearance and for nothing else. This is very common in 
            medieval and other older towns in which manufacturing, residential and commercial activities all 
            segregate but with little planning or none at all. 
            f. The status of the settlement 
            
            
            The position of a settlement in the urban hierarchy of the area, determines both the category and 
            arrangement of functions. For example, the higher the city is on the urban hierarchy, more 
            specialist and international functions dominate the central area. The other normal economic 
            activities of the core are relegated to suburbs and even to the rural urban fringe. 
            TOPIC: MANAGEMENT OF URBAN ENVIRONMENTS 
            Lesson 18: Settlement Planning 
            A. Meaning of planning 
            The rapidly changing nature of settlements both urban and rural has made geographers more than 
            ever before to extend their concern across distribution of settlements and interactions to careful 
            planning for the future of settlements. According to Peter Hall, planning is “an ordered sequence 
            of operations, designed to lead to the achievement of either a single goal or to balance between 
            several goals”. In geography, planning has both economic goals (i.e. the identification of best 
            location for services or the prevention of damaging spatial imbalances in the distribution of 
            industry) and social goals (i.e. they might be the development of improved urban environments 
            or the reduction of socially divisive spatial differences in levels of income). From these, it is 
            clear that settlement planning falls within the realm of the social goals of geography and 
            geographers. 
            
            B. Reasons for Urban Planning 
            1. Physical growth: Towns are growing outwards towards and upwards. The former destroys 
            valuable agricultural land and the latter may be detrimental to urban living (i.e. as it may 
            cause wind eddies, shadows in streets, etc apart from social problems). Large towns may also 
            create problems of administration, especially when they overlap county or state boundaries. 
            2. Traffic congestion: This does not only cause noise, air pollution and frustration, but also can 
            hinder industrial activity and encourage the depopulation of city centres. 
            3. Food and water supplies: Town dwellers are often dependent upon distant regions for their 
            food and water. Failures in economic planning, poor harvest, dock and transport strikes and 
            traffic hold-ups can cause food shortages. Periods of drought or faults in pipeline can cause 
            water shortages. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the urban demand for water 
            
            
            normally grows at a faster rate than town population growth and freshwater supplies become 
            scarcer. 
            4. Building decay: industrial and residential buildings in towns are often obsolete and decayed; 
            some because they are old, some because they were poorly built, some because they were 
            damaged by enemy action during war. Central urban areas are usually the most dilapidated, 
            characterized by ‘twilight zones’ that is, zones in which there are numerous slums, poor 
            social services and high crime rates. 
            5. Air and water pollution: An atmosphere contaminated with grit, dust, noxious factory 
            fumes, and vehicular exhaust has been a most serious problem in industrial towns. Pollution 
            of this kind is dangerous to health, causing heart diseases, respiratory ailments and lung 
            cancer. It also destroys townscapes, defacing buildings and status, corroding metal window 
            frames and affecting plant growth. 
            6. Waste disposal: Apart from gaseous and liquid effluents there is the added problem of solid 
            waste discharge. Domestic refuse may be piled at local tips, industrial waste often forms 
            mountainous heaps. Both are unsightly and both can be dangerous, the former damaging 
            health, the latter causing physical destruction. 
            C. Need for Countryside or Rural Planning 
            a. Depopulation: This results partly from improved agricultural technology and partly of 
            natural decline. Country districts generally offer fewer employment opportunities than do 
            towns, and fewer social, cultural and educational facilities. Depopulation may help 
            agricultural improvements to take place, but it can also lead to social and political 
            difficulties. 
            b. Decline of country occupations: New technology, changing demands and mass production 
            are causing the disappearance of many rural craftsmen such as blacksmiths, thatchers, 
            wheelwrights and saddle makers. This does not only worsen the employment situation but 
            also leads to the destruction of village life. 
            c. Poor social conditions: Many parts of the countryside are fairly inaccessible, with poor road 
            and rail networks and inadequate public transport. Also, many country cottages are small and 
            overcrowded, ‘tied’ to farm employment and lack adequate water supplies, gas, electricity 
            and mains drainage. 
            d. Village urbanization: Improved transport and living have led many town workers to seek 
            homes in the countryside. This can transform farming villages into commuter settlements. 
            
            
            The newcomers are often wealthy upper class or middle class families and professional 
            workers who can afford to buy cottages at prices far higher than those within the reach of 
            country folk. The resulting rise in property values causes an increase in the rate of out
            migration by the original villagers. This change in population has a serious effect on the 
            essential character and community spirit of many rural areas. 
            e. Second homes: The urbanization of the countryside is further encouraged by the increasingly 
            common phenomenon of weekend or holiday accommodation. Well-off town dwellers buy 
            homes for temporary use- caravans, houseboats, converted cottages and even, in some places, 
            purpose-built villas and chalets. Areas of particular natural beauty, such as mountains and 
            coastlines are especially vulnerable to this sort of development and are suffering in 
            consequence with inflated property prices, traffic congestion on narrow roads and greater 
            stress on social facilities. 
            f. Tourism: Leisure and recreational facilities now represent the most serious danger of urban 
            encroachment into the countryside. The periodic invasion of tourist brings in its wake traffic 
            congestion, litter and pollution, conflict between farmers and visitors, ugly camping and 
            caravan sites, and the intrusion of petrol stations, cafes, gift shops and other such 
            incongruous features. 
            
            Lesson 19: Solving Inner City Decay/Decline 
            Despite the various landmark successes achieved by urban planners through the formulation of 
            plans for new towns, it failed to contain the spread in the overall urban landscape. Single town’s 
            growth was controlled but new urban centres appeared thereby carrying still urban activities in 
            the unlimited countryside. 
            A. Inner city and its problems 
            i) Definition: This is the area near the centre of the city (CBD) which is densely populated 
            and which contains dilapidated housing, often in multiple occupations. Thus, it is the area 
            surrounding the CBD. It is also considered as that part of the city which still possesses 
            historic covers with obsolete and decaying buildings. It is therefore the central area of the 
            town and its inner residential area. This inner part of the city is mainly the product of 
            
            
            building forms that occurred during the early phase of urban development. It is sometimes 
            called “the zone of transition” or “the twilight zone” or “city core”, “old town or down”. 
            ii) Characteristics of the inner cities or inner city problems 
            a. Ageing: This is urban decay or decline and is the main characteristic of the inner city today. 
            This is the general decline of many of the social and economic characteristics of the inner 
            city as housing, social services, infrastructure, industrial base, population and traffic. This is 
            seen in large areas of wasteland, many empty buildings, high percentage of general 
            dereliction and decay, high number of closures amongst commercial premises because of 
            high rates and rents. 
            b. Unemployment: There are very high rates of unemployment than the city as a whole with 
            few jobs opportunities, limited careers prospects for those still employed.  
            c. Changing social structure: There is unbalanced population with high proportions of elderly 
            and disadvantaged people, racially mixed inhabitants with substantial ethnic minorities. High 
            concentration of ethnic minorities may be due to internal or external factors. Minority groups 
            such as blacks or new immigrants concentrate in parts of the area thereby making it a 
            reception area for immigrants. 
            d. Lack of morale and confidence: This is manifests in high level of crime and violence, 
            depressed community spirit, insufficient policing and falling education standards. 
            e. Changing land use: In this zone of transitional activities, there is much construction and 
            reconstruction works going on. 
            f. Excess loss of population: This is especially the young and middle income people moving to 
            the suburbs, new towns and expanded towns. The influx of immigrants from other regions or 
            countries cannot compensate for this out flow. The nature and linkage between city problems 
            is very complex and is viewed as the web of decline, and cycle of deprivation and despair. 
            B. Planning within the city 
            The problems of the inner city have been tackled in a number of ways. Until recently, pressures 
            for change in already established and built-up areas were mainly accommodated by changing the 
            use of buildings and refurbishing them. Thus it was common observing the conversion of large 
            dwelling houses on the edge of CBDs into offices for small businesses or old industrial buildings 
            and warehouses into other uses. Today therefore, these urban renewal schemes are used in 
            
            
            addition to the rationalization of urban land use patterns. This has been experienced in stages as 
            follows. 
            a. Phase 1 (1946-67): This is the epoch of urban renewal. The following are some of the 
            several views that have been given for it. - It is the redevelopment or improvement of an old urban core i.e. it is the collection of 
            methods of improving the urban environment. - It is a policy designed to regenerate inner city areas. it is also a response to public awareness 
            that the state of urban problems has now increased to a point where it threatens the 
            functioning of our major cities. - It is one of the solutions to urban decay which has been developed since 1945 and it is 
            complementary to the programmes for building new towns and overspill estates in which 
            people from the cities were rehoused.  
            Urban renewal or redevelopment takes two forms as follows 
             Spontaneous renewal: This is the form that occurs where demand for land in the city centre 
            exceeds supply. It entails the refurbishing of old buildings. This type is necessary because the 
            new development brings in higher rents. For example, the redevelopment of the centre of 
            London in the city and along the River Thames was of this type. The gentrification process of 
            houses (fairly well-off people buy older houses as good investments and improve them) is 
            part of this. 
             Comprehensive renewal: this form entails the clearance (demolition) of large areas and 
            rebuilding with well-planned and designed new functions,. It is usually undertaken by local 
            authorities and/or private companies. It is worth noting that even if demolition is quicker than 
            rebuilding, large cleared areas may be left as areas of urban blight. 
            Lesson 20: Measures of Checking Town Spread 
            a. Green Belts: These are broad rings or zones of the country side (agricultural land or wood 
            land of perhaps 10km wide) that encircle towns and cities within which urban development 
            (housing, industries, shopping centres) is restricted and the open character of the countryside 
            is preserved and protected for farming and recreation. It can also be seen as areas of open and 
            
            
            low density land use surrounding existing settlements where further urban extension is to be 
            strictly controlled. 
            Reasons for Greenbelts - To preserve the special character of historically or architecturally important towns. - To facilitate urban renewal - To provide an improved environment and recreational (leisure) areas for city dwellers - To check the encroachment of towns into the unrestricted countryside as protecting farmland 
            from urban development. - To prevent the eventual coalescence of neighbouring towns. 
            Weaknesses of Greenbelts 
             They do not serve the recreational needs of urban areas as a whole as they used largely by 
            local residents. 
             It does not completely prevent the building of houses in the zone. This is because population 
            density is increasing and the built up area is encroaching into the green belt sites. 
             They are usually managed in an unimaginative way with some areas which could be 
            described as being derelict. 
             Housing developments are moved beyond the green belt into the unrestricted countryside. 
             It has created numerous other problems especially in the LEDCs. It is evidence in LEDCs 
            that green belt restrictions placed on large cities to prevent further development have been 
            over taken by other events, with the city continuing to sprawl and take up much of the green 
            belt areas. 
             Land prices escalate in areas close to the green belt due land scarcity relative to demand. 
            They restrict the supply of development land, thus raising its price and that of houses 
            constructed upon it. 
             There is an increase in commuting distance. 
            Pressures on Green Belts 
            It has been observed that limiting outward urban growth through “Green Belt” means that the 
            excess urban population has to be accommodated beyond the immediate town environs. This 
            pressure on green belt is generated in the following ways: 
            i. Activities of land speculators and development planners: Green belt restraint has never 
            stopped land owners submitting planning applications for development and although success 
            
            
            in obtaining planning permission is low, the huge financial rewards for those who do succeed 
            has always encouraged land speculation in the rural urban fringe. 
            ii. Road constructions: They are destroyed by new roads constructed through them to link up 
            new and expanded towns. The construction of the M25 motorway through the London Green 
            Belt is a good example. 
            iii. Impact of Unfriendly activities: Some parts of the green belts have been greatly destroyed 
            that it is now really a “brown belt” and of little environmental value. This is when green belt 
            land has been used for unfriendly activities as market gardening, sewage work, roads, air 
            fields, hotels and hospitals. 
            iv. Development of recreation facilities: Some poor agricultural land in green belts has been 
            converted to golf courses, ridding, schools and other non-farming use. 
            v. Housing estates: There is much pressure on them for housing. David Waugh stated that 
            “Green Belt homes plan goes ahead”.  
            b. New Towns: These are newly created well planned settlements that accommodate over spill 
            populations and functions from large cities. These are conceived towns of modern sizes 
            intended function as economically viable units with a full range of manufacturing and service 
            industries, modern shopping and they provide both employment as well as better housing for 
            their own inhabitants and more. They contain a balance of social communities. The aim is 
            that these settlements should attract populations and industry from overcrowded inner 
            districts of towns and cities. Examples include; New Delhi (India), Bangkok (Thailand), 
            Abuja (Nigeria), etc. 
            
            Reasons for New Towns 
             To house overspill population: The main and pioneer motivation has been for them to 
            accommodate population over spill from large towns. This is why it started around London, 
            the then largest world city. 
             Effects of the Second World War: The idealism of the New Towns was in part the result of 
            post-war euphoria and the strong social cohesion that the war had created. Also, the large 
            scale unemployment of the 1930s and the destruction during the war created the desire to 
            improve the urban and economic infrastructure. This is why the idea started off immediately 
            at the end of World War II (1946). 
            
            
             Changes in living conditions: the rising incomes increased leisure and comparatively lower 
            costs of travel have also increased the demand for second home ownership, which is also 
            swelling the market for new city locations. 
             Social Needs: After the Second World War there was need to provide better housing to 
            citizens. This is seen how in Britain, the government organized the dispersal of thousands of 
            people from the bomb devastated areas of inner London to these New Towns that formed a 
            ring on the outer limits of London Green Belt. 
             Develop New Resources: This is exploiting newly discovered minerals. For example in 
            Scotland, Glenrothes was originally built to exploit a new coal reserve. Some are found in 
            mining zones in southern Africa and Australia. It is worth noting that many did not live up to 
            expectation simply because exhaustion of the resources provokes their decline. 
             Regional development: Some are built to open up backward areas for development. Good 
            examples are Cuidad, Guyana and in Venezuela. 
             Political motives: These are established as new political capitals. Good examples are Brasilia 
            (Brazil), Abuja (Nigeria). 
             Science parks: These need special designed settlements for their development. It is for this 
            reason that new towns become centres of science and technology. Examples are the 
            multifunctional Polis near Adelaide (Australia) and Technopoli in Japan. 
            Objectives of New Towns - Strike a balance between the needs of living and working - Provide good quality housing with all amenities for people across the income range. - Give a green and open quality to the towns. The boundaries of new towns were generously 
            drawn giving architects space to experiment in contrast to the high rise blocks that were 
            mushrooming in the large cities. Thus they were designed to be “self-contained and balanced 
            communities for working and living”. 
            Appraisal of New Towns 
            Positive Appraisal 
             They have created more pleasant environments and a better quality of life 
             They have attracted much foreign investments as industries; they have been praised for 
            providing modern industrial premises. 
             They fostered the development of good quality housing that is relatively in expensive. 
            
            
             They have generated great employment opportunities. This is because job selection meant 
            that industrialist could choose the skilled labour they required and those chosen were 
            generally well qualified and lived in New Towns. 
             It encouraged the development of higher commercial hierarchies as shopping centre. For 
            example, the first pedestrian shopping centres developed in the UK were New Towns. 
             Increased social amenities as there are over 1,100 schools found in the 32 New Towns in 
            Britain alone. 
            Negative Appraisal 
            o New towns find it difficult to insulate themselves from the character of the regions in which 
            they were located. This is because some were found too close to a main conurbation. 
            o They lack community spirit or homeliness. The social balance expected has not always 
            emerged in some of them as there was difficulty of attracting the middle class which was 
            necessary to achieve a good social mix. 
            o Many new towns are ugly in appearance. This is because they lack variety of architectural 
            styles common in older towns. People living at or close to areas where new towns were 
            planned were some of the first to exhibit the now well known “not-in-my-backyard” 
            (NIMBY) syndrome. 
            o High unemployment in the wider region was usually reflected by unemployment above the 
            national average in the new town. This is because insufficient employment opportunities 
            were available. Thus most living in them as well as expanded towns continued to commute 
            back to work in the large cities, thereby placing a severe strain on the transport network. 
            o High cost and wastage is common. The success of the new towns in creating half a million 
            new homes in 50 years has to be measured against the huge numbers of demolished terraced 
            houses which were structurally sound and simply in need of renovation. 
            o Inadequate facilities. It is held that social amenities and shopping facilities are inadequate for 
            their population. They were therefore not self-contained as it was first hoped. Thus 
            community inadequacies instead rose to higher levels than originally envisaged with high 
            rents and rigid land use zoning has increased the amount of commuting. 
            c. Ring roads: These are major route axes along which cities tend to expand especially during 
            periods of rapid economic expansions. These sites are favourable because they provide 
            advantages of good accessibility to the core of the city and good linkages with other urban 
            
            
            centres and markets. In these zones growth is sustained by market forces as private investors 
            and businesses seek the greatest profit-generating locations. The government’s role is 
            therefore limited to control this growth as to prevent it from becoming a continuous build-up 
            area, and preserve parts of the rural environment. 
            d. Cities of the future: These are towns that take a widely dispersed form, with housing and 
            business areas being separated by green leisure zones and open psaces. In the very near 
            future, large urban centres (conurbations and megalopolis) will have some plans as follows: 
            i) Satellite towns or neighbourhoods plan: This approach was enacted as a modification of 
            the earlier model of New Towns as a series of isolated neighbourhoods around an existing 
            centre, planned as self-contained discrete units, theoretically independent of the central city. 
            In this new approach, the new towns have to be planned as an integral part of the donor or 
            parent town. Thus all the neighbourhods are linked to the main town or city by a series of 
            well-developed transport routes. The city of the future was therefore to be “a new town given 
            a new form that makes it has links with the central city”. The best example of this form has 
            developed around Stockholm in Sweden. 
            ii) The Radial, Stellate or Finger Plan City: In this type,, new towns or new suburbs are 
            developed along the radial routes leading out from the city centre. In this case commuting 
            and other links between the new towns and the central city are acknowledged and accepted, 
            but made as efficient as possible. This approach is seen in the development of many new 
            towns in the LEDCs while in the Old world the cities of London and Copenhagen were 
            redeveloped from this style. 
            iii) The Circuit or Ring City: This was a modified form of the linear concept. In this the 
            dominant transport route becomes a ring route with a number of towns along its length and 
            open space in the middle. The best example of towns approaching this concept is the so 
            called Greenbelt Metropolis of Ramstad in Holland and San Francisco in California USA. 
            iv) The Linear or Beaded Linear Plan City: This was first proposed by the Spanish architect 
            Arturo Soria Mata. This appeared as a radical approach for it was different from existing 
            city forms. In this plan the city is built and grows along a single axis of high speed, high 
            intensity transportation. Industrial development is allowed to occur along one side; offices 
            and shops on the other; while houses just beyond.  He held that this plan gives residents easy 
            access to open space and allows for virtually unlimited expansion. 
            
            
            v) The Core, Compact or High Density or Plan City: This was conceived by the Swiss born 
            architect, le Corbusier, as a sharp contrast to the ideas of Wright. He was aimed at achieving 
            very high overall densities urban structure but leaving up to 95% of the grown unbuilt upon, 
            complete flattening out of the urban density gradient, eliminating the high concentration of 
            buildings in the CBD and the substitution of virtually equal densities all over the city. In his 
            book “The Radiant City”, he said, a high density urban landscape is that “consisting of 
            massive skyscraper blocks widely separated in finely landscaped open space”. 
            vi) The Dispersed Plan City: This was proposed by an American architect-planner, Frank 
            Lloyd Wright. This is “a carefully planned low density settlement having a low 
            concentration of activities at the centre, low density single-family homes surrounded by 
            open space; housing districts are interspersed with shops and factories, and a vast “rurban” 
            environment lacking any nucleus, but linked together by a network of super highways”. 
            e. Technopolis Cities: These are new science cities for research and the new computer and 
            information technology industries. In addition to sites of research and information technology 
            they include housing areas and a full range of amenities. Their emergence is widespread in 
            Japan whereas part of its regional development policy, the government has encouraged the 
            setting up of technopolis cities in each prefecture. 
            f. Expanded Towns: These are old existing towns lying close to the major cities that have 
            agreed to take “over spill” populations from the major centres in order to stimulate their own 
            economic development and to help solve the problems of overcrowding and congestion in the 
            major conurbations. This is why they are called “Expanded Towns”. This tendency of 
            existing towns expanding has led to the growth of satellite towns. The aim of designing out 
            expanded towns out of existing country towns was therefore to assist the development of 
            rural areas and the reception of over spill. 
            To conclude, although the appraisal of settlement planning gives the picture that it is negative, 
            one must not be blind to the great strides these initiatives have made in resolving the numerous 
            social and economic problems of the countryside and urban areas. Without them for sure, these 
            problems would have mounted until calls would have been to demolish all settlements and return 
            to the life styles of the early man.

            Project Based Learning: Observing and recording problems of settlements 
             Go round your neighbourhood and identify the different problems faced by the 
            settlement. 
             Snap pictures to show the dimensions of the problem. 
             Identify the causes. 
             Consequences 
             Interview the head of the neighbourhood to get the measures used so far to manage the 
            problem. 
             Propose better measures that can be used to solve these problems
