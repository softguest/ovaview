OBJECTIVE: The aim of this subject is to introduce students to the basics of pest management beginning with the understanding of some terminologies. Student will be able to appreciate the definition of pest as human construct. In addition, they will familiarize themselves with some common pests and how they cause damage.
1. Introduction 
For many years now, scientists have been battling with proper definition of the word ‘pest’. It seem that in the variations of their definition, they all agree on one thing: that the definition is a human construct;
What is a pest?
A pest is any organism that interferes with man’s interest
A pest is any organism that causes economic damage to man’s property
Pests are organisms that are considered harmful or detrimental to humans, their possessions and other human interest. In other words, they injure humans, animals, desirable plants, structures or possessions and spread diseases.
For example, a grasshopper eating the leaves of your vegetable, termite destroying a wood roof of your house, the noises from mosquito and crickets, siam weed growing in your farm constitute a pest problem.


2. Pest Concept
From the definitions above, it is clear that a pest is human invention. Ordinarily, these organisms feeding on a plant is just performing its normal function in the ecosystem. A pest is defined from a biased human perspective/interest. It can be concluded that the definition of pest is very subjective – it lacks any ecological justification.
For example, Bermuda grass is grown on lawn for decoration. In this case, it is not considered a pest. However, if it grows in a cabbage garden, it will be considered a pest. You see that the same organism has different status (pest and not a pest status) based on the situation/interest.
The noise from crickets is considered a nuisance (pest status) but the same cricket is eaten (not a pest status).
Siam weed (Chromolaena odorata): weed in the field but also medicinal
Elephant gras (Penisetum purpureum): weed in the field but also a fodder. 
It is important to note that the definition of a pest is also principally economic. The organism should be able to cause an economic damage. That means that the severity of the damage should be assess or predicted before any control measure. Consequently, the number (population density) of the pest is important.
3. Types of Pests
3.1 Insects
An insect is an arthropod (jointed body parts) with six legs or 3 three pairs of legs (hexapod). Eg. Grasshoppers, locust. Chemicals used to control (kill/suppress) insect population is called insecticides.
3.2 Weeds
Weeds are plants that interfere with human activities or in some way intrude upon human comfort and welfare. They can compete with a crop of interest for nutrients, space, water, sunlight etc. e.g Siam weed, elephant grass. The chemical used to kill or suppress weed is called weedicide/herbicide
3.3 Mollusks
Theres are large group of animals characterized by soft and non-segmented bodies. They may be aquatic or terrestrial and may or may not possess shell. E.g snails, slugs, octopus, squids, scallops. The chemical used to control these organisms is molluscicide (e.g snail bait/slug pellet)
3.4 Vertebrate
A vertebrate is an animal with a spinal cord surrounded by cartilage or bone. In other words, they have backbones from which they derived their names. E.g fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals
How can humans be pest?
Rodenticide – for rodents
Avicide – for birds
3.5 Mites
Mites are insect-like organisms with eight legs. These arthropods belong to the order Acarina of the class Arachnida. E.g red spider mite: Tetranychus urticae. The chemicals used to control them is called acaricide or miticide.

2.1. CATEGORIES OF PEST
Based on occurrence following are pest categories 
Regular pest: Frequently occurs on crop - Close association e.g. Rice stem borer, tomato fruit borer. stemborers and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) in maize.
Occasional pest: Infrequently occurs, no close association e.g. Caseworm on rice, Mango stem borer 
Seasonal pest: Occurs during a particular season every year e.g. Red hairy caterpillar on groundnut, Mango hoppers 
Persistent pests: Occurs on the crop throughout the year and is difficult to control e.g. Chilli thrips, mealy bug on banana,  
Sporadic pests: Pest occurs in isolated localities during some period. e.g. Coconut slug caterpillar
Migratory or cyclical pest. They appear cyclically and often migratory in nature and they require control occasionally or intermittently. E.g locust

2.2. PEST IDENTIFICATION
Accurate identification of a pest is the first step in any effective pest management program.
Never attempt a pest control program until you are sure of what the pest is.
Correct identification of a pest allows you to determine basic information about it including its life cycle and the time that it is most susceptible to controlled. The more you about the pest and the factors that influence its development and spread, the easier it is to develop cost-effective and sustainable control programs.
To identify and control a pest, you need to know the following (NOTE THESE FOUR POINTS)
The physical features of the pest you are likely to encounter, e.g long, round, elongated, winged, wingless etc
Characteristics of the damage they cause: folded leaves, eating leaves and fruits, eggs laid inside fruits, cutting of shoots, wildering of plants, necrosis etc
Their development and biology
Whether they are continuous, sporadic or potential pest.

LECTURE 3: GOALS/PRINCIPLES OF PEST MANAGEMENT
OUTLINE:
Introduction 
Principles of pest management
Threshold level concept
Drill 

OBJECTIVE: students will familiarize themselves with the goals and objectives of pest management. Also, they will be drilled on the threshold level concept as a relevant tool for decision making in pest management
1. Introduction 
Based on your objectives, you could be talking about pest control or pest management.
Pest control involves the treatment that will eliminate infestation after the it has already occurred while pest management seeks to limit the survival and reproduction of pest by removing resources (make the environment unfavourable) such as water, food, shelter etc.
The primary objective of pest control is to eliminate whereas that of pest management is to prevent future infestation or maintain the pest population below a level that can cause economic harm to the crops (below ETL).
 

2 Goals/objectives of pest control/Principles of pest management
Whenever you try to control or manage a pest, you will want to achieve one of these three goals, or some combination of them.
⦁	Prevention: the objective is to keep a pest from becoming a problem. Prevention can be achieved when the pest’s presence or abundance can be predicted in advance as in the case of continuous pests. For example, some plant diseases occur only under certain environmental conditions. If such conditions are present, you can take steps to prevent the plant disease organisms from harming the desirable plants.
⦁	Suppression is a common goal in many pest situations. The intent is to reduce the number of pests to a level where the harm they are causing is acceptable. Once a pest's presence is detected and the decision is made that control is necessary, suppression and prevention often are joint goals. The right combination of control measures can often suppress the pests already present and prevent them from building up again to a level where they are causing unacceptable harm.

⦁	Eradication is a rare goal in outdoor pest situations, because it is difficult to achieve. Usually the goal is prevention and/or suppression. Eradication is occasionally attempted when a foreign pest has been accidentally introduced but is not yet established in an area. Such eradication strategies often are supported by the Government. Mediterranean fruit fly. gypsy moth, and fire ant control programs are examples.
In indoor areas, eradication is a more common goal. Enclosed environments usually are smaller, less complex, and more easily controlled than outdoor areas. In many enclosed areas, such as dwellings; schools; office buildings; and health care, food processing, and food preparation facilities, certain pests cannot or will not be tolerated.

3 Pest control 
Event though is pest is present, it may not do much harm. It could cost more to control the pest than would be lost because of pest damage. Thus, the following necessary pest control guidelines must be considered.
⦁	Control a pest only when it is causing or is expected to cause more harm than is reasonable to accept.
⦁	Use a control strategy that will reduce the pest numbers to an acceptable level.
⦁	Cause as little harm as possible to everything except the pest.
⦁	Even though a pest is present, it may not do very much harm. It could cost more to control the pest than would be lost because of the pest's damage.


4 Threshold level concept
In many instances, the damage to a plant is directly proportional to the number of pest (population density). For example, one locust compared to 100 locust: the damage won’t be the same. Consequently, the population of the pest needs to reach a certain level (threshold level) in order to warrant action. The population parameters include:
4.1 General Equilibrium Position (GEP)
The average density of a population over a long period of time around which the pest population tends to fluctuate due to biotic and abiotic factors, and in the absence of permanent environmental changes
4.2 Economic threshold level (ETL)
It is the population density at which control measures should be taken to prevent the population from reaching an economic injury level (EIL)
4.3 Economic Injury Level (EIL)
This is the lowest population density that will cause economic damage (the amount of injury which will justify the cost of artificial control measures). ETL is always less than EIL.
The EIL is the most basic of the decision rules; it is a theoretical value that, if actually attained by a pest population, will result in economic damage. Therefore, the EIL is a measure against which we evaluate the destructive status and potential of a pest population.
 
GEP, ETL and EIL concept
 
Note the following:
⦁	Below the EIL cost of control > benefit
⦁	Above the EIL benefit > cost of control
⦁	ETL have been established for many pests.
⦁	It is important to constantly monitor pest population in order to decide when to take action.
⦁	ETL and EIL are very important decision-making parameters in integrated pest management programs.

Some examples of threshold
 

Calculating EIL
The EIL is governed by five primary variables: 
⦁	cost of the management tactic per production unit, (C). i.e per plant, per acre etc 
⦁	market value per production unit (V), 
⦁	injury units per pest(I), i.e percent yield loss per pest
⦁	damage per injury unit (D), 
⦁	and the proportional reduction in pest attack or in injury from treatment (K). 
If the relationship of these variables is linear or roughly so, the EIL can be given as:
EIL = C/VIDK

Example
There is a beetle that attacks apple and 1 beetle can attack 5 apples per tree to have feeding injuries. Each injured fruit means a lost of 50frs. A normal apple (not attacked) can sell for 150frs at the local market. An insecticide and labour cost per tree of 500frs will reduce the damage by 90%. Calculate the EIL
EIL = C/VIDK
C = 500frs,
V = 150fr
I = 5
D = 50 frs
K = 0.9
Therefore EIL = 500/150 x 5 x 50 x 0.9 = 14.8 approx. 15 beetles
The economic injury level increases or decreases as these values change depending on their position within the formula. As the cost of control (C) increases, it takes more insect damage to justify an application, and the economic injury level increases. In contrast, if the value of the commodity (V) increases, it takes fewer lost bushels to justify the cost of control and the economic injury level decreases. 
Note that in many cases, I and D are combined into a single measure that relates the amount of yield lost directly to the insect population density.

PEST CATEGORIES ACCORDING TO EIL, GEP AND DB

⦁	Key pest - Most severe and damaging pests - GEP lies above EIL always - Spray temporarily bring population below EIL - These are persistent pests - The environment must be changed to bring GEP below EIL e.g. Cotton bollworm, Diamond backmoth
 
⦁	Major pest - GEP lies very close to EIL or coincides with EIL - Economic damage can be prevented by timely and repeated sprays e.g. Cotton jassid, Rice stem borer
 
⦁	Minor pest/Occasional pest - GEP is below the EIL usually - Rarely they cross EIL - Can be controlled by spraying e.g. Cotton stainers, Rice hispa, Ash weevils
 
⦁	Sporadic pests - GEP generally below EIL - Sometimes it crosses EIL and cause severe loss in some places/periods e.g. Sugarcane pyrilla, White grub, Hairy caterpillar

 
⦁	Potential pests - They are not pests at present - GEP always less than EIL - If environment changed may cause economic loss e.g. S. litura is potentia pest on tomato

 
DRILL
⦁	What is the difference between pest control and pest management

Requirements of successful pest control
Drill 

OBJECTIVE: students will familiarize themselves with the components of pest management
1. Introduction
Pest management is defined as ‘the application of technology to achieve a satisfactory reduction of pest numbers or effects (pest control)’. Pest control measured can be classified based on the source of the control measure and on the purpose of the control measure.

Pest control can be broadly classified as Natural control or Applied (Artificial control) based on the source of the control measures.
Natural control: In nature, pest population is kept in check by many factors such as abiotic and biotic environmental factors. The operation of the natural factors is not dependent upon man and not influenced by him. This is called 'natural control'.

Applied or artificial control: It is planned and organized by man to eliminate or reduce the number of insects and the damage. 

The control measures are generally termed as (1) prophylactic or preventive and (2) curative or direct methods based on the purpose of the control measures.
2. Pest control measures based on purpose
2.1 Prophylactic or preventive methods: These are ‘measures taken as a preventive step before the actual occurrence of the pest’. Effective against seasonal or persistent pests. Field sanitation, ploughing, crop rotation, resistant varieties, trap cropping, mixed cropping, crop residue destruction, pest free healthy seeds, seed treatment, swabbing tree trunks with insecticides or tar, drying of grains, adjusting of sowing time, allelopathy, etc. are some of the preventive methods.

2.2 Curative or direct methods: These are ‘measures taken as a curative step to eliminate the insects after they have gained a foothold in the crops. The following are some of the curative methods.
Cultural methods: good tillage, racking and hoeing, pruning, fertilization, water management, mulching, de-trashing, timely harvest etc.
Resistant varieties: Some varieties are inherently less damaged than the other by insects
Mechanical methods: Hand destruction, exclusion and trapping.
Physical methods: Heat, cold, humidity, light and sound energy.
Chemical method: Attractants, repellents, insecticides, growth inhibitors, sterilant etc.,
Biological methods: Parasites, pathogens and predators.
Genetic method: Male sterile techniques.
Regulatory methods: Quarantines, legislation.
Integrated pest management: Integration of possible components.

CULTURAL CONTROL  
Definition
 	'Manipulation of cultural practices for reducing or avoiding pest damage to crops' is called cultural control. It is also defined as ‘control of pests through adoption of ordinary farm practices in appropriate time in such a way that pests are either eliminated or reduced in population.

The goal of cultural control is to make the crop environment less suitable for pests. Most of the time, cultural control is used as a preventative measure. By anticipating insect problems before they occur, the control techniques avoid or minimize the pest’s impact on the crop. Cultural control techniques are most effective when the target insect pests have few suitable host plants, do not disperse far or frequently, and/or have complex nutritional or environmental requirements during their life cycle.
When using cultural control techniques, it is important to be aware of the environmental context of the field. Production efficiency, yields, soil conservation, natural enemy habitat need to be taken into account for each crop/pest complex, climate, and surrounding environment. This is because cultural control techniques that maximize insect control may at times be impractical in particular contexts. For instance, the practice of tilling to disrupt an underground life stage of an insect pest may not be practical for a no-till farmer trying to reduce erosion on his or her field.


Impact of cultural control
The cultural practices may lead to the control of pest either by directly affecting their growth and multiplication or by minimizing the chance of their attack on plants. The main purpose of cultural control is to make the environment less favourable for the pest and more favourable for its natural enemies.

Strategies for cultural pest control

There are four main strategies for cultural control of pest insects:
Reduce and/or disrupt pest habitat in and around crop
Adjust crop planting to disrupt pest habitat and nutrition requirements
Divert pest population away from crop
Reduce yield loss from insect injury
1) Reduce and/or disrupt pest habitat in and around crop
Pest habitat can include crop residue, spilled seed, weeds along crop edges, volunteer plants, and soil. One technique to reduce or disrupt this habitat is sanitation. Sanitation is important both in the field as well as in storage and processing. Destroying or removing crop residue from the field by plowing, shredding, chopping, burning, or feeding it to livestock can remove or kill insect pests that are inhabiting the residue. This technique can compromise soil conservation, however, as crop residue is a source of soil nutrients and erosion control. Sanitation in storage and processing can be achieved by keeping facilities clean and eliminating spillage. These practices can reduce the spread and population growth of insect pests. Dogs can have head covering to prevent flies and other pest from their ear wounds. Other field sanitation practices include

Stalk and boll destruction against bollworm on cotton.
Destruction of stalks of cereals reduces cereal stem borer infestation 
Collection and burning of blind heads and seeds reduces incidence of the sorghum  midge
Collection and destruction of rotten and dropped fruits controls citrus fruit fly coffee berry-borer etc.
Removal of old cocoa pods after harvest eliminates source of inoculum for the spread of black-pod disease.  It also helps to break the life cycle of certain cocoa insect pests such as the shieldbug .  
Old pods and dead twigs of cocoa are used as nest sites by Pheidole and Crematogaster ant species which are important vectors of black-pod disease.
Collection of rotting vegetable fruits minimizes carry-over infestation by caterpillars of fruit borers and fruit flies.
 Pruning
Collection and burying of fallen fruits can reduce pest of apple and citrus
Destroying or modifying non-crop pest habitat is another technique to reduce or disrupt pest habitat. In Wisconsin, some insect pests overwinter in plants growing around field edges. Burning or plowing plant residue disrupts the habitat for many pests insects and can reduce the number of pests e.g remove maize stalks after harvest, remove all potato from the field after harvest so that they do not stay in the field and act as reservoir for pest and pathogens. It is important to note that destroying this field-edge vegetation removes habitat for natural enemies, and so it is recommended to survey these areas for beneficial insects to determine the value of the vegetation.
A third technique to disrupt pest habitat is tillage. Tillage can reduce some pest populations while attracting others, so it is important to know how your target species responds to tillage and what other pests tillage might put you at risk of attracting. If tillage is timed with a stage of the pest’s life cycle that is underground, it can be used to directly control insect pest populations. For pests that overwinter in the soil, mortality is increased when tillage occurs before a cold winter. The soil disturbance exposes the insect to harsher temperature and soil moisture conditions, reducing the like likelihood of survival. Another technique is crop rotation.
2) Adjust crop planting to disrupt pest habitat and nutrition requirements
Crop planting can be adjusted both in space and time to reduce the development of large pest populations.
Adjusting crop planting in space means making adjustments to where crop plants are relative to each other (density of planting), as well as where they are relative to other crops and unmanaged land. Planting densely so that the crop forms a closed canopy reduces the amount of contrast within a field. Some migrating insect pests are attracted to areas of contrast, so reducing contrast will reduce the attractiveness of a field to these insects. Additionally, dense planting increases humidity, creating a less favorable environment for some pests. At the multi-field scale, locating dissimilar crops next to each other can limit pest movement from field to field. Crops ideal for sharing field borders are those that are susceptible to different pests.
Adjusting crop planting in time means planting a crop at a time when the likelihood of damage from a key pest is reduced. This can be done by waiting one or several growing seasons before planting the same crop in the same place, or by adjusting the date of planting or other field operations around an insect pest’s lifecycle.
 Planting around a pest’s lifecycle can reduce insect damage by avoidance or tolerance. Planting or harvesting a crop before (or after) a pest is present reduces insect damage by avoidance. Trapping and calculating an insect’s growing degree days can assist with planning around a pest’s lifecycle. Damage tolerance can sometimes be achieved by planting a crop early so that the plants are stronger, more resistant, and more tolerant to damage by the time insect pests are present.
3) Divert pest population away from crop
While crops are often suitable hosts for insect pests, they are not always the best host. By creating a small, controlled space that the pests prefer, it is possible to divert pests away from the primary crop. Two techniques for this are trap cropping and strip harvesting.
Trap cropping is planting a preferred host plant of an insect pest near the primary crop that is to be protected. The pest then infests the preferred or “trap” crop instead of the primary crop. If necessary, the pests can then be killed in the trap crop. Trap crops can be any species that the pest prefers—even be the same species as the primary crop. If the trap crop is the same species as the primary crop, it should be planted at a time that will best lure the pest away from the primary crop. Read about push-pull technique

Strip harvesting is the practice of harvesting a crop in sections over time. This practice is useful when harvesting a trap crop because it maintains some habitat for the pest. As a result, the pest does not move to find new habitat in an adjacent higher value or more susceptible crop.
4) Reduce yield loss from insect injury
The techniques already mentioned focus on reducing crop exposure to insect pests, but it is also possible to reduce yield loss even when insect damage happens.
Host tolerance to damage can be optimized by planting genetically resistant and tolerant crop varieties. Also, proper irrigation, fertilization, and weed control can improve plant vigor, reducing yield loss when damage occurs.
Once damage occurs, further yield loss can be prevented by harvesting as early as possible. This works both to prevent further damage by insects, and also to prevent yield loss due to lodging of the plants.

PHYSICAL CONTROL  
Definition
	" Modification of physical factors in the environment to minimize or prevent pest problems" is called physical control.
Physical pest control is also a method of getting rid of insects and small rodents by killing, removing, or setting up barriers that will prevent further destruction of one's plants. These methods are used primarily for crop growing, but some methods can be applied to homes as well.


Impact of physical control
Insects require definite ranges of physical conditions and any departure from such ranges are lethal to the survival and other life activities of insects.

Physical methods in pest management
I. Temperature manipulation
Insect activity and metabolic rate are influenced by environmental temperature. Optimum range of temperature is vital for normal insect activity.
High lethal temperature
    Sun drying of grains - rice weevil
          Hot water treatment of rice seeds at 52-54oC for 15 minutes-white tip 
                                         nematode
          Flaming (flame thrower)-Locusts and moringa hairy caterpillar.
          Steaming (Steam sterilization of soil)- Nematodes in green house.
Low lethal temperature: Cold storage of potatoes - potato tuber moth

II. Moisture manipulation
In well-dried grains (moisture content <10%), the survival of stored grain pests becomes impossible. Eg. Rice weevil, pulse beetle. Alternate wetting and drying in rice fields reduces the brown plant hopper damage

III. Light manipulation
Behavioural orientation is influenced by light. Provision of light causes
1. Mating frequency reduction	- RHC
2. Reduced fertility			-Indian meal moth and
3. Diapause disruption		- All diapausing insects.

Light trapping: It Serves many purposes like monitoring initial infestation, seasonal incidence, pest / weather relationship, pest intensity, pest survey, trapping and killing.

IV. Use of electromagnetic energy
Use of radio frequency (RF) (wave length range is 102-1010µ) affects thoracic ganglion and causes synaptic blocking, alteration of amino compounds of nerve cells and dissolution of nerve cells Eg. Rice weevil
Use of infra red radiation (wave length range 0.78-102µ ) - rice weevil  
Use of visible (0.38-0.78µ) and UV radiation (2 X 10-2 - 0.38µ).  Yellow colour attracts aphids and black colour attracts Angumois grain moth. 
Ionizing radiation-X rays (10-5-10-2µ), gamma rays (10-8 -10-4µ) kill sterilize insects at lethal dose.  

V. Use of sound energy
Acoustical device (Bird scarer/acetylene exploders) produces sudden loud sound which  frighten birds.
Fire crackers also used to make loud sound to scatter away squirrel, foxes, rats, mice, deer, etc.

Disadvantage: Habituation to the sound












MECHANICAL CONTROL

LEGAL CONTROL

Definition
	"Preventing the entry and establishment of foreign plant and animal pests in a country or area and eradication or suppression of pests established in a limited area".

In Cameroon, the Phytosanitary Unit in MINADER works with other ministries to define the framework for legal control of pest

Components of Legal control
1 Plant Quarantine (Foreign quarantine)
	Legal restriction of movements of plants and plant materials between countries and between states within the country to prevent introduction and spread of pests and diseases where they do not exist.

Restrictions on import of plant materials
Scientists can obtain the seeds with permission from competent government agencies (seed bank)
Plant materials should be imported only with import permits.
The consignments should be accompanied by phytosanitary certificate from the country of origin.
Quarantine inspection of materials is made at notified sea and Airports. 
Fumigation of imported plant materials is also done based on need.

2 Domestic quarantine
	While most quarantine operations are designed for cross boarder or international activities, countries with vast surface areas and varying environmental conditions require domestic quarantine. It is the ‘legislation to prevent of spread of already established pests from one part of the country to another’.

 
3. Enforcement of Pest control measures
	It is the legislation to prevent damages and spread of already established pests.	

4. Quality control
	It is the ‘legislation to prevent the adultration and misbranding of insecticides’.	
The Government of Cameroon enforced "Law no. 2003/003 0f April 2003 concerning phytosanitary measures or crop protection practices", which empowers to regulate the import, manufacture, sale, transport, distribution and use of insecticides. 	The pesticide firms should register themselves stating the name and address of manufacturer, the brand and trade name of the insecticide, the active ingredient, net content in an unit pack, details of antidote. The container should carry a poison label with skull and cross bones and a warning or caution statement.
		Central Insecticide Board was set up to advise Centre and States on technical matters of insecticide usage.

5. Legislation to regulate activities of personnel engaged in pest control
It ensures safety to workers engaged in plant protection operations and to public.

Four questions to understand a behaviour
Nikolaas (Niko) Tinbergen was a Dutch ornithologist, or bird biologist, who studied behaviour and is now considered one of the founders of the field of ethology. Based on his own research, Tinbergen proposed four basic questions helpful in understanding any animal behaviour.
Let's look at these questions, using the production of song by the zebra finch—a common songbird—as an example.

Causation—What causes the behaviour? What triggers the behaviour, and what body parts, functions, and molecules are involved in carrying it out?
Example: Singing is triggered in zebra finches by social cues, such as the proximity of a potential mate, as well as the appropriate hormonal state. The ability to produce songs is influenced by male hormones and occurs mainly in male birds. Songs are produced when air flows from air sacs in the bronchii through an organ called the syrinx. Certain parts of the brain control song production and are well-developed in male zebra finches.
Development—How does the behaviour develop? Is the behaviour present early in life? Does it change over the course of the organism's lifetime? What experiences are necessary for its development?
Example: Young male zebra finches first listen to the songs of nearby males of their species, particularly their fathers. Then, they start to practice singing. By adulthood, male zebra finches have learned to produce their own songs, which are unique but often have similarities to those of their fathers. Once a finch has perfected its song, the song remains fixed for life.
Function/adaptive value—How does the behaviour affect fitness? How does the behaviour affect an organism's chances of survival and reproduction?
Example: Singing helps male zebra finches attract mates, increasing the chances that they will reproduce. Singing is part of an elaborate courtship ritual that entices the female to choose the male.
Phylogeny—How did the behaviour evolve? How does the behaviour compare to those of related species? Why might it have evolved as it did?
Example: Almost all species of birds can make vocal sounds, but only those in the suborder Passeri are songbirds. Relative to the zebra finch, other songbird species differ in the timing of their listening and practicing phases, the plasticity of song over their lifetimes, the extent to which the song is similar among individuals of the species, and the way that singing is used—for example, for defence of territory vs. courtship of mates.
Cues that trigger behaviour
At its core, an animal behaviour is a response to an internal or external cue. Through behaviour, animals can act on the information they receive in ways that will, hopefully, favour their survival and reproductive success.
What kinds of cues can trigger behaviour? In some cases, the cue is largely external:
In hibernation, an animal goes into a den or burrow, reduces its metabolic rate, and enters a state of inactivity during the harsh season, conserving resources while conditions are harsh and food is scarce. Environmental cues often trigger hibernation behaviour. 
Estivation is similar to hibernation, but it occurs during the summer months. Some desert animals estivate in response to dry conditions. This shift helps them survive the harshest months of the year.
Migration is a behaviour in which animals move from one location to another in a seasonal pattern. For instance, monarch butterflies living in the northern and central United States migrate to Mexico in the autumn, where they spend the winter. Environmental cues that trigger the autumn migration include air temperature, day length, and food availability.
In other cases, the cue for a behaviour may be internal. For instance, some behaviours occur with a circadian rhythm, meaning that they are triggered by the animal's internal body clock. You, for example, tend to wake up and become active at roughly the same time each day. As you may have discovered if you've ever taken a long flight, your body's alarm clock will still "go off" at the same time even if the external cues change, which is what causes jet lag!
It's also common for behaviours to be triggered by a combination of internal and external cues interacting. For instance, mating behaviours may be triggered in an animal only when it's in the right hormonal state, an internal cue, and when it sees a member of the opposite sex, an external cue.
Innate vs. learned behaviours
When we are trying to understand how a behaviour develops and how it arose evolutionarily, one important question is whether the behaviour is genetically preprogramed or acquired through experience. 
Innate behaviours are genetically hardwired and are inherited by an organism from its parents.
Learned behaviours are not inherited. They develop during an organism's lifetime as the result of experience and environmental influence.
Behavioural biologists have found that many behaviours have both an innate and a learned component. So, it's generally most accurate for us to ask to what extent a behaviour is innate or learned.
Mostly innate behaviours
There are some examples of behaviours that are really and truly hardwired. These behaviours take place in a highly predictable way in response to the right stimulus, even if the organism has never before encountered that stimulus.
For example, an adult salamander will swim perfectly if it's placed in water, even if it never saw water when it was young and has never watched another salamander swim. In this case, the behaviour of swimming can only be explained as something genetically preprogramed in the salamander.
Similarly, you—or any human—will rapidly jerk your hand away if you touch a very hot object. This response is a reflex that's hardwired in the circuits of your sensory and motor neurons and doesn't even involve your brain.
Partly innate, partly learned behaviours
In other cases, an organism is genetically programmed to develop a behaviour, but the form the behaviour takes depends on the individual's experience.
One example is the learning of a song by a zebra finch or other songbird, as we saw above. All male zebra finches will begin listening to and learning song at about the same age and practicing and producing song at a slightly later age. Although this pattern is genetically determined, the exact features of the song a bird sings will depend on the songs it hears during its learning period.
Another, more familiar example is language acquisition in humans. Babies are preprogramed for language learning, but which language they learn depends on what they're exposed to during their plastic, or formative, period.
Mostly learned behaviours
In other cases, behaviours are largely dependent on experience—they're learned—and can't be fully explained by genetic preprograming.
For instance, if a rat receives a food reward each time it pushes a lever, it will quickly learn to push the lever in order to get the food. Similarly, if a cow gets an electric shock each time it brushes up against an electric fence, it will rapidly learn to avoid the fence. Pushing a lever to get a reward and avoiding electric fences are not hardwired in rats and cows but are, instead, learned behaviours the animals develop through experience.
If a behaviour is learned rather than innate, it isn't directly inherited. But it does still depend on genes. For instance, not all types of animals could learn to push a lever to get a reward. The rat's capacity to learn this behaviour depends on how its brain is wired, and the construction, maintenance, and function of a rat brain are all determined by genes in the rat genome.

I. The nervous system 
 
The nervous system is the part of an animal's body that coordinates its behavior and transmits signals 
between different body areas. It includes all the organs and tissues which enable animals to respond to 
changes in their environment.  
 
The nervous system consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the peripheral nerves which connect the 
various parts of the body to either the brain or spinal cord.  
A variety of cell types are found within the nervous system, but the primary functional cell is the neuron. 
A major function of the other cell types (the glia), appears to be to maintain the cellular environment to 
support the activity of the neurons.  
 
The basic functions of the nervous system can be summarized thus: 
1. Initiate and/or regulate movement of body parts by initiating and/or regulating the contraction of skeletal, 
cardiac, and smooth muscles 
2. Regulate secretions from glands     
3. Gather information about the external environment and about the status of the internal environment of 
the body, using senses (sight, hearing, touch, balance, taste) and mechanisms to detect pain, temperature, 
pressure, and certain chemicals, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and oxygen 
4. Maintain an appropriate state of consciousness 
5. Stimulate thirst, hunger, fear, rage, and sexual behaviors appropriate for survival. 
 
All functions of the nervous system require the rapid transmission of information from one site within the 
body to another. This transmission is accomplished at specialized junctions known as synapses. 
 
I.1. Anatomy of the nervous system 
For descriptive purposes the entire nervous system can be divided into two main parts: the central nervous 
system (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which 
consists of cranial nerves and spinal nerves going to and from the body structures (somatic NS and 
autonomic NS).  
The many complex functions of the nervous system are accomplished by two cell types: neurons and glial 
cells, also called the “glue” of the nervous system, glia or  neuroglia. Neurons transmit nerve impulses and 
join with others via synapses. Glial cells provide service to neurons and their environment.  
 
I.1.1.  Neurons and Synapses 
The individual nerve cell is called a neuron.  
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
Neurons possess the usual features of cells, but in keeping with their function of communication over long 
distances, they also exhibit a number of specializations. 
 The neuron (nerve cell) consists of the cell and all its processes, the dendrites, and the axon.  
A neuron has only one axon but can have many dendrites. The dendrites provide the sites for receiving 
information from other neurons. They can be highly branched in order to provide a large surface area for 
communication with great numbers of axons.  
Mammalian neurons can be categorized as,  -unipolar neurons (have one process; true unipolar neurons are seen only during development),  -bipolar (one axon and one dendrite extending from the cell body), -pseudo unipolar (in which the axon and dendrite of a bipolar neuron have fused near the cell body, giving 
the appearance of only one process), and  -multipolar (many branching dendrites and one axon extending from the cell body).  
Most primary afferent neurons are pseudounipolar and are further characterized under the heading 
Peripheral Nervous System. Bipolar neurons are found in the retina of the eye and the olfactory region 
(sense of smell) in the nose.  Most neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) are multipolar. 
 
The axon (and its myelin covering, if present) is called a nerve fiber. The part of the cell membrane that 
covers the axon is known as the axolemma. In a myelinated axon, the axolemma is surrounded by a myelin 
sheath (neurilemma) that is interrupted at regularly spaced intervals by myelin-free gaps, called nodes of 
Ranvier. 
 A group of nerve cell bodies within the brain or spinal cord is referred to as a nucleus, and a group 
of nerve cell bodies outside the brain or spinal cord is called a ganglion.  
 A bundle of parallel neuron fibers within the brain or spinal cord is known as either a tractor or a 
fasciculus, and a bundle of neuron fibers outside the brain or spinal cord is called a nerve.  
Continuity from one neuron to the next is provided by the synapse. There is no physical contact of neurons 
at the synapse. A space exists between the neurons, the synaptic gap, and impulses from one neuron to the 
next are transmitted by chemical means through this space. This is chemical synaptic transmission, in 
contrast to electrical synaptic transmission. Because most synaptic transmission is chemical, our 
considerations will be limited to chemical transmission.  
Three notable characteristics of the synapse are: 
1) one-way conduction (direction),  
2) facilitation (repeated impulses provide for easier subsequent transmission), and  
3) greater fatigability than the neuron (allows for repetitive impulses to fade) 
  
 Myelin Sheaths 
Myelin is a white lipid (sphingomyelin) substance that forms a sheath around nerve fibers and serves as an 
electrical insulator. It is formed by oligodendrocytes in the CNS and by Schwann cells in the peripheral 
nervous system (PNS). Nerve fibers within the gray matter of the CNS are not myelinated; their white 
glistening appearance outside of the gray matter, as shown by the white matter and by peripheral nerves, is 
provided by the myelin that envelops the nerve fibers. Not all nerve fibers outside of the gray matter are 
myelinated, but because of the closeness of unmyelinated fibers to myelinated fibers, they tend to be 
invaginated (pressed) into the myelin substance. Even when this occurs, however, unmyelinated fibers are 
uninsulated because they maintain a direct association with extracellular fluid throughout their length. 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
The Schwann cell cytoplasm (which contains the myelin) is wrapped around a nerve fiber many times, and 
the nucleus lies within the Schwann cell just beneath the neurolemma external to the myelin sheath.  The 
cytoplasm of the oligodendrocyte is different from that of the Schwann cell because several extensions 
exist, each of which forms a wrapping around a nerve fiber. One cell, therefore, provides a sheath at several 
locations. Interruptions of the myelin sheath that occur along the length of a fiber are called nodes of 
Ranvier. These nodes are the junctions of adjacent wrappings, either of the cytoplasmic extensions of 
oligodendrocytes or of Schwann cells. At these points, the nerve fiber plasma membrane (axolemma) is 
directly exposed to extracellular fluid. The exposure is more intimate in the CNS. Whereas the sheathed 
portion of the nerve fiber is insulated, the nodes are uninsulated. Depolarization occurs at the nodes, and 
the function of the myelin sheaths will become more apparent when nerve conduction is discussed. 
 
I.1.2.  Glial Cells. 
Glial cells are the non-neuronal cellular elements of the CNS.  
They outnumber neurons by about 10-fold and make up about half of its volume. The dense packing of 
neurons and the more numerous glial cells cause nervous tissue to have less interstitial space than other 
tissues.  
Glial cells are metabolically quite active. Glial cells include oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, ependymal cells, 
and microglia in the CNS and satellite cells, Schwann cells in the PNS. - Astrocytes are the most prominent glial cell, and their processes abut blood vessels, synaptic structures, 
and nerve cell bodies and processes. Because of their interposition between blood vessels and neurons, 
astrocytes not only provide support but also facilitate transport of blood constituents (provide nutrients) 
from capillaries to neurons. They help repair damage to nervous tissue and  maintain brain-blood-barrier 
which keep potential toxic substances in  the blood from entering the brain. Also, astrocytes release 
excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in response to stimulation. This permits a communication with the 
neurons by either stimulating or varying its response. Under some circumstances, too much glutamate may 
be released and lead to excitotoxicity, by which neurons can be killed. - The most significant role of oligodendrocytes is their involvement in myelin sheath formation in the CNS. 
A similar function in the peripheral nervous system is performed by Schwann cells.  - Ependymal cells (Ependymocytes) line the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. 
In these locations, the ependymal cells unite with the capillaries to form the choroid plexus, where 
cerebrospinal fluid is produced. This fluid circulate around the brain and  perform many functions including  
protecting the brain from injury and removing waste product from the brain. - The microglia have a phagocytic function. They enter the CNS from blood vessels and increase in numbers 
during inflammatory processes or where neuron injury has occurred. They act as the primary immune 
defense of the CNS. They remove things like damage neurons, pathogens and foreign substances.  - Schwann cells are involve in myelin sheath formation in the PNS. - Satellite cells support and protect neurons, regulate neural environment. 
 
I.1.3.  Central Nervous System 
I.1.3.1.  Brain 
The gross subdivisions of the adult brain include the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem.  
The cerebrum develops from the embryonic telencephalon.  
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
The components of the brainstem are defined in a number of ways; for our purposes, we include the 
diencephalon, midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata as parts of the brainstem. 
 
a) Cerebrum (Cerebral Hemispheres).  
 
The right and left cerebral hemispheres are large structures that make up most of the cerebrum. Each 
hemisphere is composed of a covering of gray matter, the cerebral cortex; a central mass of white matter, 
the medullary substance (made up of nerve fibers); and the basal nuclei (previously known as basal ganglia, 
but because they are in the CNS, they are now called basal nuclei). - The cerebral cortex has the following characteristics: 
(1) Acquired late in vertebrate evolution 
(2) Concerned with those nervous reactions that result in consciousness 
(3) Regarded as the seat of the highest type of nervous correlation (association) 
(4) Marked by a high degree of educability (especially in humans) 
(5) Possesses a motor area: a. Impulses from these areas in one hemisphere cause muscle movements on 
the opposite (contralateral) side of the body.  b. Size of motor area and number and complexity of skeletal 
muscle movements of which an animal is capable are directly related. 
(6) Contains sensory areas, or centers, into which sensory fibers discharge. The sensory areas are:  
(a) the somesthetic or body sense area, which receives impulses from the skin concerned with touch, 
 warmth, cold, and pain localization; impulses concerned with taste; and impulses from muscles, 
 tendons, and joints;  
(b) the visual area (sight); 
(c) the auditory area (hearing); and  
(d) the olfactory area (smell).  
The white matter is composed of myelinated nerve fibers situated beneath the cerebral cortex. These 
include association fibers, which establish connection between the different parts of the cortex; commissural 
fibers, which connect the two hemispheres; and projection fibers, which connect the cerebral cortex with 
other parts of the brain and spinal cord.  
The basal nuclei lie deep within the cerebral hemispheres. They are composed of separate, large pools of 
neurons organized for the control of complex semi voluntary movements, such as walking and running. In 
birds the cerebral cortex is poorly developed, but the basal nuclei are highly developed. Because of this 
contrast, the basal nuclei perform nearly all of the motor functions, even the voluntary movements, in much 
the same manner as the motor area of the human cortex controls voluntary movement.  
 
 
b)  Cerebellum.  -Is the second largest part of the brain.  - Contains nerve fibers that connect it to every part of the central nervous system.   -Coordinates voluntary and involuntary patterns of movements. It also adjusts muscles to automatically 
maintain posture. 
The cerebellum is not concerned with consciousness or sensation, as is the cerebral cortex. Because of its 
motor function, the cerebral cortex can start a limb or body part in motion, but once in motion, inertial 
forces would tend to keep it in motion until opposing forces stopped it. The cerebral cortex is not organized 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
to mobilize the opposing force. The cerebellum, however, can make automatic adjustments to prevent the 
distortion of inertia and momentum. To accomplish this, the cerebellum receives impulses:  
(1) from the proprioceptive receptors (located in the internal mass of the body) found in all joints, muscles, 
and pressure areas (e.g., foot pads);  
(2) from the equilibrium apparatus of the inner ear;  
(3) from the visual cortex; and  
(4) directly from the motor cortex of all motor impulses being sent to muscles. Whereas the motor area of 
a cerebral hemisphere exerts its effect on the opposite (contralateral) side of the body, the effect of one side 
of the cerebellum is exerted on the same (ipsilateral) side of the body. The cerebellum acts as a “collecting 
house” for all information regarding the instantaneous physical status of the body.  
Finally, this part of the brain is responsible for coordinating voluntary movements. It is also responsible for 
a number of functions including motor skills such as balance, coordination, and posture. 
 
c)  Brainstem. 
 The brain stem is composed of the interbrain rostrally, followed caudally (in order) by the midbrain, pons, 
and medulla oblongata. The cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum arise from the brain stem. In addition to 
the many fiber tracts that ascend and descend between the spinal cord and the cerebrum and cerebellum, 
the brain stem is the origin of all the cranial nerves except for the optic, olfactory, and acoustic nerves 
(special senses). The cells of origin for the latter lie outside of the skull. From below upward, the interbrain 
is composed of the hypothalamus, thalamus, and epithalamus.  
.The hypothalamus contains the hypophysis or pituitary gland, which is an endocrine organ. Associated 
with the hypothalamus is a complex sensing and neurosecretory function. Also, the hypothalamus assumes 
a major role in the integration of functions carried out by the autonomic nervous system. It regulates 
behavior and emotional expression, body temperature, and many metabolic activities 
.The thalamus contains many nuclei and is truly a relay center. Impulses from all areas of the body are 
transmitted to the thalamus for transfer to the cerebral cortex. Other nuclei in the thalamus are associated 
with the relay of impulses within the brain.  
.The epithalamus contains an olfactory (smell) correlation center and the pineal gland. The latter is a 
neurosecretory organ that regulates gonadal hormones and certain daily rhythms. 
.The midbrain contains the auditory and visual reflex centers, the nuclei of two cranial nerves, and several 
descending tracts. 
.The medulla oblongata and pons contain many ascending and descending pathways, the sensory and motor 
nuclei for all of the cranial nerves originating in the brain stem (except the two located in the midbrain), 
and a large part of the central mechanism of the postural reflexes (e.g., hopping, righting, placing). There 
are also several reflex centers associated with the regulation of important visceral functions such as heart 
rate, blood vessel muscle tone (vasomotor tone), respiration, and motor and secretory activities of the 
digestive tract.  
 
I.1.3.2.  Spinal Cord  
 -Is the caudal continuation of the medulla oblongata.  -It is responsible for movement and sensation. It carries signals between the brain and the rest of the body 
(is the pathway for messages sent by the brain to the body and from the body to the brain). The spinal cord 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
receives sensory afferent (inflowing) fibers by way of the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves and gives off 
efferent (outflowing) motor fibers to the ventral roots of the spinal nerves.  -The centrally located gray matter (which resembles a capital H and is sometimes called the gray H) consists 
primarily of nerve cell bodies and their processes.  -The peripherally arranged white matter, which has a white appearance because of its myelin sheath, is 
composed of many distinct tracts.  -A tract is a bundle of nerve fibers having a common origin, termination, and function; and connects the 
brain stem and higher centers with the spinal nerves. Different sensory and motor tracts are segregated in 
the cord.  
. Proprioceptive (referring to the sensing of position of limbs or other body parts without the use of vision) 
impulses from muscles, tendons, and joints have well-defined ascending tracts, as do sensory impulses for 
pain, temperature, and touch. Similarly, impulses associated with certain motor functions descend in 
definite tracts. Many of the tracts are named according to the structures they connect. For example, the 
ventral spinocerebellar tract carries impulses from the spinal cord to the cerebellum. The lateral 
spinothalamic tract carries impulses from the spinal cord to the thalamus.  
The cells of origin for sensory impulses to the brain or to other parts of the spinal cord are located in the 
dorsal horns of the gray matter, and the cells of origin of motor impulses to the spinal nerves are located in 
the ventral horns of the gray matter. The cells of origin of the autonomic motor impulses arising from the 
spinal cord are the lateral masses of the ventral horns (intermediate location) of the gray matter. As the 
spinal cord descends and proceeds caudally, its cross-sectional area decreases. This is because the cranial 
parts not only have tracts with fibers from the caudal portions, but also contain fibers associated with the 
cranial aspects of the body. Finally, at the caudal extremity, the tracts terminate and the spinal nerves fan 
outward and backward, giving the appearance of a broom or horse’s tail. Accordingly, the terminal part of 
the spinal cord, meninges, and nerves is called the cauda equina. 
 
 Meninges and cerebrospinal fluid 
The connective tissue coverings of the brain and spinal cord are the meninges (singular meninx). They 
include, from deep to superficial, the pia mater, the arachnoid, and the dura mater. 
The pia mater, the deepest of the meninges, is a delicate membrane that invests the brain and spinal cord, 
following the grooves and depressions closely. The pia mater forms a sheath around the blood vessels and 
follows them into the substance of the CNS. The middle meninx arises embryologically from the same layer 
as the pia mater but separates from it during development so that a space forms between them. Remnants 
of their former connection in the adult take the form of many filaments of connective tissue that extend 
between them. Because of the weblike appearance of these filaments, this middle layer is called the 
arachnoid (arachnoidea, arachnoid mater), and the connecting filaments are the arachnoid trabeculae. 
Together, the pia mater and arachnoid constitute the leptomeninges (from the Latin word lepto, delicate), 
reflecting their fine, delicate nature. The space between the two layers, bridged by arachnoid trabeculae, is 
the subarachnoid space. It is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is from this space that CSF is 
collected when a spinal tap is performed. 
The dura mater is the tough fibrous outer covering of the CNS. Within the cranial vault the dura mater is 
intimately attached to the inside of the cranial bones and so fulfills the role of periosteum. It also forms the 
falx cerebri, a median sickle-shaped fold that lies in the longitudinal fissure and partially separates the 
cerebral hemispheres. Another fold of dura mater, the tentorium cerebelli, runs transversely between the 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
cerebellum and the cerebrum. In some locations within the skull, the dura mater splits into two layers 
divided by channels filled with blood. These dural sinuses receive blood from the veins of the brain and 
empty into the jugular veins. They are also the site of reabsorption of CSF through the arachnoid 
granulations back into the circulation. The pia mater and the arachnoid of the spinal meninges are much as 
they are within the cranial vault. The dura mater of the spinal meninges, however, is separated from the 
periosteum of the vertebral canal by a fat-filled space, the epidural space. 
It is into the epidural space that physicians and veterinarians introduce local anesthetics to produce 
anesthesia in the caudal parts of the body. This procedure, epidural anesthesia, is often done for obstetric 
procedures. One common application is the injection of anesthetic between the first and second caudal 
vertebrae of the ox as an aid to repairing and reducing uterine, vaginal, or rectal prolapses. 
 
I.1.4.  Peripheral Nervous System 
The peripheral nervous system consists of the spinal nerves and the cranial nerves. Its purpose is to convey 
sensory information to the brain and spinal cord and to produce movement of muscle and secretion from 
glands via its motor nerves. 
 
I.1.4.1. Spinal Nerves 
With the exception of cervical and caudal nerves, a pair of spinal nerves (one right and one left) emerges 
caudal to the vertebra of the same number and name. For example, the first pair of thoracic nerves emerges 
through the intervertebral foramina between the first and second thoracic vertebrae; the last pair of thoracic 
nerves emerges through the intervertebral foramina between the last thoracic and first lumbar vertebrae, 
and the first pair of lumbar nerves emerges through the foramina between the first and second lumbar 
vertebrae. Thus there are the same number of pairs of thoracic, lumbar, and sacral nerves as there are similar 
vertebrae. The first pair of cervical nerves emerges through the lateral vertebral foramina of the atlas and 
the second pair between the atlas (C1) and axis (C2). Therefore, there are eight pairs of cervical nerves 
although only seven cervical vertebrae. Usually, there are fewer pairs of caudal nerves than caudal 
vertebrae. Five or six pairs are typically seen in domestic ungulates. Dorsal and ventral roots arise from the 
spinal cord and fuse, generally close to the intervertebral foramen. At this point, the conjoined sensory 
fibers of the dorsal root and motor fibers of the ventral root become the spinal nerve, characterized as a 
mixed nerve, since it has both sensory and motor elements. Almost as soon as the spinal nerve emerges 
through the intervertebral foramen, it divides into a dorsal branch and a ventral branch. Both of these 
branches are mixed nerves, because each contains both sensory and motor fibers.  -In general, the dorsal branches of spinal nerves innervate structures (muscles and skin) that are dorsal to 
the transverse processes of the vertebrae.  -The ventral branches supply structures ventral to the transverse processes and most of the thoracic and 
pelvic limbs.  
The spinal nerves tend to innervate the region of the body in the area adjacent to where they emerge from 
the vertebral column.  
The limbs, however, are supplied with sensory and motor fibers within tangled arrangements of spinal 
nerves known as plexuses. The regions of the spinal cord supplying the plexuses are visibly greater in 
diameter because they have more sensory and motor neurons supplying the mass of the limbs. These 
enlargements are called intumescences. Brachial Plexus.  
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
Each thoracic limb is supplied by a brachial plexus, a network of nerves derived from the last three cervical 
and first one or two thoracic nerves. The spinal cord enlargement associated with the brachial plexus lies 
primarily in the caudal cervical vertebrae and is consequently described as the cervical intumescence. The 
brachial plexus gives rise to specific named nerves that innervate the muscles of the thoracic limb and 
supply sensation to the same general regions of the skin. 
Lumbosacral Plexus. The right and left lumbosacral plexuses supply nerves to the respective pelvic limbs. 
The lumbosacral plexuses are made up of the ventral branches of the last few lumbar and first two or three 
sacral nerves. The visible spinal cord enlargement here is called the lumbar intumescence. 
 
I.1.4.2.  Cranial Nerves 
Classically, 12 pairs of cranial nerves arising from the brain. They are designated by Roman numerals, 
numbered from most rostral (I) to most caudal (XII). With the exception of cranial nerves I (olfactory) and 
II (optic), the cranial nerves arise from the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata and in general resemble 
ordinary spinal nerves. They do not, however, have discernible dorsal and ventral roots, and some are 
strictly motor or sensory (as opposed to spinal nerves, which are all mixed nerves). Cranial nerve II, the 
optic nerve, only superficially resembles an actual nerve of the PNS. Its fibers are actually a tract of the 
CNS, invested with meninges and with myelin provided by oligodendrocytes.  
 
I.1.5. Autonomic Nervous System 
The ANS is the part of the nervous system that regulates activity in viscera and other structures not normally 
under voluntary control.  
The common representation of the ANS as a motor subdivision of the peripheral nervous system ignores 
the facts that (1) sensory fibers from viscera make up a large proportion of the fibers in autonomic nerves 
and (2) some CNS tracts and nuclei integrate and control visceral activity. Nonetheless, for purposes of this 
introduction, we consider only the peripheral motor components of the ANS. These are the nerves that 
influence activity in smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands. 
 In motor nerves to voluntary muscle, the cell bodies of neurons directly innervating the target are found in 
the gray matter of the CNS, and the telodendria of these neurons make direct contact with the target. Motor 
nerves of the ANS, in contrast, consist of a series of two neurons. The first has its cell body in the CNS, 
and its axon extends into the periphery, where it synapses on the cell body of a second neuron. It is the axon 
of the second neuron that contacts the visceral target. Because of this two neurons arrangement, autonomic 
nerves are characterized by the presence of autonomic ganglia, peripheral collections of the cell bodies of 
the second neurons. Using the autonomic ganglion as a point of reference, the first neuron is called 
preganglionic, and the second, postganglionic. The motor output of the ANS is concerned with 
homeokinesis, the dynamic process of regulating the internal environment to meet the needs of the 
organism. As a consequence, the motor limb of the ANS is functionally and anatomically divided into two 
parts. The sympathetic division of the ANS prepares the organism to meet a stress by producing a 
combination of physiologic changes that increase available fuel molecules, blood flow to muscle, and 
cardiac output while simultaneously decreasing digestive processes. The parasympathetic division of the 
ANS is in many respects the opposite of the sympathetic division. Parasympathetic activity leads to 
digestion and storage of fuel molecules and acts to bring the organism to a state of rest. 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
I.1.5.1. Sympathetic Nervous System 
Sympathetic nerve fibers arise from thoracic and lumbar segments of the spinal cord, thus the sympathetic 
division is sometimes called the thoracolumbar division.  
Preganglionic sympathetic neurons have their cell bodies in a small lateral horn of the spinal cord gray 
matter, between dorsal and ventral horns. The myelinated axons of these fibers leave via the ventral root, 
enter the spinal nerve, and then leave it just outside the intervertebral foramen to join a longitudinal chain 
of autonomic ganglia.  -The ganglia, together with the nerve fibers that link them longitudinally, are called the sympathetic trunk. 
The ganglia themselves are most correctly called the ganglia of the sympathetic trunk, although they are 
also called paravertebral or sympathetic chain ganglia. Cell bodies of many of the postganglionic 
sympathetic neurons are found here. 
 From the sympathetic trunk ganglia, the unmyelinated axons of postganglionic neurons reach their targets 
either following spinal nerves or via unique autonomic nerves. In some cases, preganglionic axons pass 
through the trunk without synapsing and instead synapse on other sympathetic ganglia outside the 
sympathetic trunk. This second group, collectively known as prevertebral or collateral ganglia, tends to be 
associated with the large, unpaired arterial branches of the abdominal aorta, after which they are usually 
named.  
No sympathetic preganglionic cell bodies lie cranial to the thoracic spinal cord, so - sympathetic innervation 
to head structures (e.g., the pupil, sweat glands, salivary glands) arrives at its targets by traveling cranial in 
right and left bundles of fibers in the ventral neck. These are the cranial continuation of the sympathetic 
trunks in the thorax. These preganglionic sympathetic fibers are bound in a connective tissue sheath with 
fibers of each vagus nerve (cranial nerve X); the combined fibers are therefore called the vago-sympathetic 
trunk, readily identifyed dorsolateral to and parallel with the trachea (windpipe). Sympathetic fibers in the 
vagosympathetic trunk synapse in the cranial cervical ganglion, found ventral to the base of the skull, and 
from this ganglion the postganglionic fibers spread to the glands and smooth muscle of the head.  
No sympathetic preganglionic cell bodies  exist caudal to the midlumbar region, so - sympathetic 
innervation to pelvic organs (rectum and urogenital organs) arrives via the right and left hypogastric nerves, 
a continuation of the caudal parts of the sympathetic trunk. The fibers of the hypogastric nerve become 
admixed with parasympathetic fibers in a diffuse network of autonomic nerves on the lateral surface of the 
rectum called the pelvic plexus. The sympathetic innervation to the adrenal is unique in that preganglionic 
sympathetic fibers synapse directly on the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla without an intervening 
ganglion. Sympathetic stimulation causes this tissue to release catecholamines (epinephrine and 
norepinephrine) into the bloodstream, producing a widespread, pronounced, and prolonged fight-or-flight 
response. This is another physiologically important site at which the rapid communication system of the 
body (the nervous system) is integrated with the slow, more lingering communication system of the body 
(the endocrine system). 
 
I.1.5.2.  Parasympathetic Nervous System 
The parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system arises from cranial nerves and sacral 
segments of the spinal cord; for this reason, it is sometimes called the craniosacral division. Fibers of the 
cranial portion are distributed via four cranial nerves: the oculomotor, facial, glossopharyngeal (III, VII, 
IX), and vagus nerves (X). The first three of these supply parasympathetic fibers to smooth muscle and 
glands of the head. The vagus nerve supplies parasympathetic fibers to the viscera of the thorax and neck 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
and to nearly all of the abdominal viscera. The distal part of the digestive tract (including the transverse 
colon and the area caudal to it) and the pelvic viscera are innervated by parasympathetic fibers from the 
sacral portion of the parasympathetic nervous system. These pelvic fibers intermix with sympathetic nerves 
to form the pelvic plexus. 
 
I.1.5.3.  Enteric Nervous System 
This is the network of motor and sensory neurons embedded in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract and its 
accessory glands (e.g., pancreas, liver).  
Activity in the enteric nervous system is influenced by the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of 
the ANS, but the system is functional without input from outside the viscera. 
Two dense networks of neurons are found in the walls of these organs. One, the submucosal (Meissner’s) 
plexus, is just deep to the inner lining of the gut. The other, the myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus, is found 
within the muscular layer. Normally the motor output of the ANS controls the overall activity of the viscera, 
but in large part the intrinsic neurons of the enteric nervous system control local events. Sensory neurons 
monitor local stretch, chemical composition of the gut’s contents, and gastrointestinal hormones. Activity 
in these sensory neurons stimulates local reflex movements, mediated by the motor neurons of the enteric 
nervous system. In this way, motility of the gut, dilation of local blood vessels, and secretions can be 
adjusted to meet the immediate local demands of digestion. 
 
 
I.2. Physiology of the nervous system 
I.2.1. The Nerve Impulse and its transmission  
Communication among neurons and with the cells of their control is accomplished by the transmission of a 
nerve impulse (i.e., action potentials propagated along the axons of neurons within the nerves).   
A nerve impulse originates in response to a stimulus of an electrical, chemical, thermal, or mechanical 
nature that has been received by the cell membrane of a neuron.  
The stimulus elicits a wave of depolarization and repolarization that spreads along the axolemma, away 
from the site where the stimulus was received, which results in the transmission of the nerve impulse. 
. The word potential is used in regard to nerve cells as it is in the study of electricity, in which it refers to 
relative electrical charges between two points in a field or circuit. For the neuron, this is referred to as a 
transmembrane potential, and the two points are the inside and outside of the confines of the cell membrane. 
. All cells of the body have a transmembrane potential, but the neurons are unique in being able to alter 
this potential to produce an impulse. The charged transmembrane potential is a local phenomenon close to 
the cell membrane and does not refer to a charge inside and outside the cell, which is electrically neutral.  
. A measured potential is relatively small, however, and its units are in millivolts rather than volts. 
 
I.2.1.1. Resting Membrane Potential 
.The resting membrane potential is the potential between the two sides of the membrane in a resting 
neuron.  
. It results from the unequal distribution of sodium ions (Na+) and potassium ions (K+) on the outside and 
inside of the neuron.  
.The active transport of Na+ to the outside, coupled with the transport of K+ into the neuron (the Na+ /K+ 
ATPase pump), keeps the concentration of Na+ low on the inside of the membrane. If their rates of transport 
were equal to each other, electrical neutrality between the inside and outside of the membrane would be 
maintained. However, the outward active transport of Na+ occurs at a faster rate than the inward active 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
transport of K+, and thus an electronegativity is maintained on the inside of the membrane and an 
electropositivity on the outside. The membrane is therefore polarized.  
. The resting membrane potential has been measured as about −70 millivolts (mV). It does not exceed −70 
mV because, at this level, the electrical gradient is sufficient to cause Na+ diffusion inward to balance the 
rate of outward active transport. 
 
I.2.1.2. Depolarization, Repolarization, and the Nerve Impulse 
 
. Chemical or physical stimulation of a neuron increases the permeability of the membrane for Na+ at the 
point of stimulation and, because there is a high concentration of Na+ on the outside of the membrane in 
the extracellular fluid, Na+ rushes inward. This reverses the membrane potential at the point of stimulation, 
so the membrane now becomes positive on the inside and negative on the outside; this is depolarization. 
The inflow of Na+ soon stops and the permeability of the membrane for K+ increases; the K+ then flows 
outward because it has a higher concentration inside the neuron than outside. The outflow of K+ 
reestablishes the resting membrane potential at the point of stimulation; this is repolarization. (The closing 
of the sodium channels and the exit of additional potassium repolarizes the membrane. The exit of additional 
potassium produces a small after hyperpolarization until resting conditions can be reestablished). 
When a microregion of a nerve fiber is stimulated and subsequently depolarized, a current flow occurs from 
the point of depolarization to the adjoining microregions. Current flow occurs because a positive charge 
now exists inside the membrane at the point of initial depolarization; because of the negative charge inside 
the membrane, beyond the point of stimulation, the positive charges (ions) flow toward the negatively 
charged portion. In addition, the outer aspect of the fiber membrane (which has become negatively charged 
at the point of depolarization) attracts positive ions to it from the charged membrane farther ahead. Because 
of these two events, the interior of the fiber just beyond the depolarized region becomes somewhat more 
positively charged and the exterior of the fiber just beyond the depolarized region becomes less positively 
charged. Accordingly, an electrical current flows outward through the fiber membrane from the interior 
(that gained positive charges) to the exterior (where positive charges were drawn away). The passage of 
current out through the membrane, just beyond the site where depolarization has occurred, causes this region 
of the membrane to become depolarized in turn (because current flow increases permeability to Na+), just 
as the membrane did at the site of the stimulus. The process of depolarization followed by current flow is 
repeated throughout the length of the nerve fiber and accounts for the nerve impulse.  
 
I.2.1.3. Action Potential 
Action potentials are changes in the resting membrane potential that are actively propagated along the 
membrane of the cell. The application of a stimulus to a nerve cell membrane diminishes the resting 
membrane potential (zero direction). When the membrane potential reaches a critical value (usually 10 to 
15 mV less than the resting level of −70 mV), an action potential occurs. The membrane potential at which 
an action potential is produced is referred to as threshold. Not all stimuli can depolarize the membrane to 
threshold. During an action potential, depolarization can change the membrane potential from −70 mV to 
about +40 mV. During repolarization there is a return to the resting membrane potential of −70 mV.  
The refractory period is the period when the nerve fiber cannot be stimulated again until repolarization is 
nearly complete; this is known as When an action potential has been initiated, the nerve fiber is said to fire. 
If the stimulus is strong enough to initiate an action potential, the entire fiber will fire. This is known as the 
all or-none principle for nerve fibers. There is no such thing as a weak impulse.  
If the stimulus is strong enough to initiate depolarization, the impulse will be conducted with action 
potentials of normal magnitude.  
Depolarization and repolarization proceed from one microregion to the adjoining microregion until the 
entire fiber has been traversed. 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
I.2.1.4. Conduction Velocity and Myelination  
As described above, the axons of neurons may be either unmyelinated or myelinated.  
.Unmyelinated axons have voltage-gated sodium channels throughout their cell membrane, and thus the 
propagation of action potentials along unmyelinated axons is as described earlier (from one microregion to 
the adjoining microregion).  
The myelin sheath that surrounds myelinated axons contains the lipid sphingomyelin, which is a good 
insulator against ionic flows. Each Schwann cell covers about a 1-mm distance along the axon, and the 
junction between two Schwann cells is called the node of Ranvier. No myelin is present at these nodes, and 
voltage-gated sodium channels are especially prevalent in the axonal cell membrane at the node. Therefore, 
the circuits of current must flow from node to node, and action potentials occur only at the nodes. Since this 
is analogous to jumping from one node to the next, it is given the name saltatory conduction (from Latin 
saltare, to jump). This type of conduction contributes to the increased rate of impulse conduction in 
myelinated axons. Conduction velocities of axons also depend on their diameter. Large-diameter axons 
propagate action potentials at higher velocities than do small-diameter axons, because large axons have less 
internal resistance to the flow of current.  
 
 
I.2.1.5. Synaptic Transmission.  
Synapses are specialized junctions where information is exchanged between neurons or between a neuron 
and the cell or cells that it innervates. Two general types of synapses, electrical and chemical, are found 
between neurons in the nervous system, with chemical synapses being more prevalent.  
Electrical synapses are essentially gap junctions between the cell membranes of adjacent neurons that 
permit ionic exchange.  
Information exchange at chemical synapses entails the release of a chemical neurotransmitter from the 
presynaptic neuron. When an action potential arrives at the terminal end of the presynaptic neuron, the 
change in membrane potential is believed to be responsible for opening voltage-gated calcium channels. 
The calcium concentration within the cytosol is lower than the calcium concentration in the extracellular 
fluid, so calcium can diffuse through the open channels into the cell down its concentration gradient. The 
increase in intracellular calcium within the terminal end of the presynaptic neuron is associated with 
exocytosis of neurotransmitters stored in secretory vesicles within the presynaptic neuron. Typically, an 
individual neuron contains vesicles with only one primary neurotransmitter, but a wide variety of substances 
have been found to function as neurotransmitters. The cell membranes of presynaptic and postsynaptic 
neurons (or other target cells) are not in immediate contact. A small but distinct separation exists, and the 
space between is the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitters released by the presynaptic neuron must diffuse 
across the synaptic cleft to have their effect on postsynaptic neurons, or target cells. However, this diffusion 
occurs almost instantaneously because of the very small size of the cleft (average 20 nm).  Neurotransmitters 
typically bind to cell membrane receptors on postsynaptic neurons or target organs. At synapses between 
neurons, the binding changes the postsynaptic membrane’s permeability to ions (either directly or indirectly 
via second messengers), and this in turn produces a change in the membrane potential of the postsynaptic 
neuron.  
Synapses and the neurotransmitters that depolarize the postsynaptic neuron are excitatory synapses and 
excitatory neurotransmitters, while synapses and neurotransmitters that hyperpolarize the postsynaptic 
neuron are inhibitory. The change in postsynaptic membrane potential produced by excitatory 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
neurotransmitters is an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), while an inhibitory neurotransmitter 
produces an inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP). Typically, excitatory neurotransmitters cause 
membrane depolarization by increasing the membrane’s permeability to sodium, while inhibitory 
neurotransmitters increase the membrane’s permeability to either potassium or chlorine. Hyperpolarization 
of the cell membrane can be brought about by either an increased rate of potassium exit from a cell or an 
increased rate of chlorine entry into the cell down their respective concentration gradients. 
The amount of excitatory neurotransmitter released by a single action potential in a single presynaptic 
neuron is constant. However, it is also typically insufficient to depolarize the postsynaptic neuron to a 
threshold voltage at which an action potential can be elicited. Therefore, to reach threshold voltage in a 
postsynaptic neuron, the change in voltage produced by multiple EPSPs must be summated.  
Summation of EPSPs is classified as either temporal or spatial. Temporal summation occurs when a single 
presynaptic neuron releases neurotransmitter repeatedly before the effect of each single release is lost. When 
effective summation occurs, the additive effects of the multiple releases are enough to produce an action 
potential in the postsynaptic neuron.  
Spatial summation occurs when simultaneous or nearly simultaneous neurotransmitter release occurs at 
more than one synapse on the postsynaptic neuron. Spatial summation is possible because neuron cell 
bodies typically have multiple junctions with many presynaptic neurons. After a neurotransmitter has been 
released and had its desired effect on the postsynaptic neuron, it must be removed to prevent continuous 
stimulation of the postsynaptic neuron.  
The specific mechanisms by which neurotransmitters are removed from neural synapses vary among 
neurotransmitters. However, in general these can be any one or a combination of the following:  
(1) enzymes in the area of the synapse degrade the neurotransmitter;  
(2) cell membrane transport systems absorb the neurotransmitter; or 
 (3) the neurotransmitter diffuses away from the area of the synapse.  
Typically, as described earlier, a single neuron and its dendrites contain multiple synaptic junctions and 
receive synaptic input from multiple presynaptic neurons, so a single neuron may receive impulses from 
several sources. This pattern or organization is described as convergence. Divergence is the opposite: each 
axon branches so that synaptic connections are made with many neurons. These organizational patterns 
permit information to be widely distributed throughout a neural network (divergence) or permit multiple 
sources of information to be brought to focus on a single neuron for a focused response (convergence). 
These are very simple illustrations of how the organization of neuronal networks can contribute to the 
processing and integration of information. For example, a single neuron can be simultaneously stimulated 
by excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters from different presynaptic neurons (a converging network). 
The property of spatial summation permits the neuron receiving these converging inputs to integrate the 
different stimuli and respond appropriately. 
 
I.2.2. Neurotransmitters 
Most neurotransmitters can be classified as amino acids, monoamines (modified amino acids), or 
polypeptides. While more than 20 compounds have been proved to function as neurotransmitters (and the 
list will surely grow), some are especially prevalent throughout the nervous system and should receive 
individual consideration.  
Acetylcholine (derived from the amino acid choline) is the neurotransmitter released at the neuromuscular 
junction on skeletal muscle by some peripheral neurons of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and found 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
at many synapses throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Neurons releasing acetylcholine are 
classified as cholinergic, and this term is also applied to synapses for which acetylcholine is the 
neurotransmitter. Two general classes of acetylcholine (also termed cholinergic) receptors, nicotinic and 
muscarinic, are found at cholinergic synapses. The enzyme acetylcholinesterase is responsible for rapidly 
degrading acetylcholine and thus terminating its action at cholinergic synapses.  
Norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter used by most peripheral neurons in the sympathetic division of the 
ANS and at synapses at several sites in the CNS. Presynaptic neurons and synapses using norepinephrine 
are termed adrenergic, and this term is also applied to cell membrane receptors that bind norepinephrine. 
The term adrenergic has been applied to these receptors because epinephrine, or adrenaline, also binds to 
these receptors. (Adrenaline is the British term for epinephrine, which is released from the adrenal gland.) 
Adrenergic receptors may be classified as α1, α2, β1, or β2 according to their relative binding affinities for 
various adrenergic agonists. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are both classified as catecholamines because 
of their chemical structure and because they are derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Dopamine is another 
catecholamine that functions as a neurotransmitter within the central and peripheral nervous systems, and 
specific dopamine receptors also exist. 
 γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the most prevalent inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter in the CNS. 
Binding of GABA to its receptor produces neuronal hyperpolarization (inhibition). Several agents that act 
as sedatives, tranquilizers, and general muscle relaxants have part of their effect via promoting GABA’s 
effects on the CNS. These include alcohol, barbiturates, and the benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam and 
chlordiazepoxide). Some of these agents bind directly to GABA receptors; others seem to facilitate the 
action of endogenous GABA. The GABA receptors may also be the principal target for some general 
anesthetics. Glutamate is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, and several subtypes of 
glutamate receptors have been identified. One subtype of glutamate receptor, the NMDA receptor (named 
for the agonist Nmethyl- D-aspartate), are found in high concentrations in areas within the brain that are 
involved with memory and learning. Stimulation of NMDA receptors is believed to bring about long-term 
potentiation of transmission in neural pathways in these areas. 
 
 
I.2.3. Neural Control of Skeletal Muscle 
Each contraction of skeletal muscle requires stimulation of the muscle by a somatic motor neuron. Somatic 
motor neurons have their cell bodies within the CNS, and their axons extend from the CNS to contact 
skeletal muscle cells at neuromuscular junctions. Each time an action potential passes down the axon of a 
single motor neuron, all skeletal muscle cells that are innervated by that motor neuron are stimulated to 
contract. A single motor neuron can stimulate more than one skeletal muscle cell, but a single skeletal 
muscle cell receives input from only one motor neuron. Thus, all contractions of any single skeletal muscle 
cell must be initiated by action potentials arriving via the same motor neuron.  
.A clinical classification applied to the motor neuron that extends from the CNS to skeletal muscle fibers is 
lower motor neuron (LMN). (More specifically, this is the somatic LMN, but somatic is often omitted in 
common usage.) Any contraction of skeletal muscle depends on an intact and properly functioning LMN, 
and the classic sign of a dysfunctional LMN is flaccid paralysis (a total lack of movement and muscle tone 
of the affected muscle). Typically, a single neuron receives inputs from multiple other neurons because of 
convergence in neural networks. Therefore, a single LMN is subject to regulation by multiple inputs from 
other neurons within the CNS.  
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
Upper motor neuron (UMN) is the general term applied to a neuron within the CNS that acts to regulate the 
activity of a LMN. UMNs are responsible for initiating voluntary movement and maintaining relatively 
stable body posture and position relative to gravity so that voluntary movements are normal. If the LMNs 
to a muscle are intact but some of the UMNs that normally regulate those LMNs are dysfunctional, both 
reflex and voluntary activity of the muscle are possible, but the character of both reflexes and voluntary 
activity may be abnormal. 
 
 
I.2.4. Reflexes  
A reflex is defined as an automatic or unconscious response of an effector organ (muscle or gland) to an 
appropriate stimulus. 
In the case of reflexes involving skeletal muscle, the response is skeletal muscle contraction.  
The entire neural circuit from stimulus detection to response is a reflex arc, and consist of: 
1) a receptor,  
2) an afferent limb, 
3) central connections,  
4) an efferent limb, and  
5) an effector organ. 
 
I.2.4.1. Spinal Reflex 
A reflex can involve parts of the brain and autonomic nervous system, but the simplest reflex is the myotatic 
(stretch) spinal reflex. 
The reflex is elicited by striking the middle patellar ligament. This ligament, located at the knee, is the 
tendon of insertion for the quadriceps femoris and transmits its action to extend the tibia. Striking the middle 
patellar ligament stretches the quadriceps muscle, which in turn stimulates muscle spindles (receptors for 
muscle sense). An impulse is transmitted by way of the dorsal root of the appropriate spinal nerve to the 
applicable motor neuron in the ventral horn of the gray matter, and thence to muscle fibers of the quadriceps 
muscle, causing it to contract. The purpose of the reflex is to oppose stretch of the muscle. Because this 
reflex involves an intact and functioning spinal cord at a certain level of segmentation, the soundness 
of the cord at that level can be determined by this reflex action. Absence of the knee jerk reflex can 
help to confirm suspicion of damage or injury to the spinal cord or any of the five components of the 
reflex arc. This reflex is a postural reflex because it aids in maintaining a standing position. Spinal reflexes 
can also be rather complex, in which the central connections of the reflex extend over several segments and 
also extend contralaterally as well as ipsilaterally. The crossed extensor response is an example of a complex 
spinal reflex. This is shown when there is painful stimulation of the skin or subcutaneous tissues and muscle. 
The response is flexor muscle contraction and inhibition of extensor muscles so that the part stimulated is 
flexed and withdrawn from the stimulus and  at the same time there is extension of the opposite limb 
(assisting withdrawal). 
 
 Somatic and Visceral Reflexes 
If the effector organs are composed of striated muscle, the reflex is somatic. If the effector organs are either 
smooth or cardiac muscle, or glands, the reflex is visceral. Visceral reflexes regulate visceral functions and 
are transmitted by the autonomic nervous system (by visceral afferent fibers and preganglionic and 
postganglionic efferent fibers of the sympathetic or parasympathetic division). 
 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
I.2.4.2. Reflex Centers 
Reflex centers are located throughout the central nervous system. They are involved with the integration 
of more complex reflexes. The simplest reflexes are those associated with the spinal cord, and the more 
complex are carried out through reflex centers in the brain. Some of these centers are located in the pons 
and medulla oblongata and include reflex centers for the control of heart action, vessel diameter, respiration, 
swallowing, vomiting, coughing, and sneezing. The cerebellum contains most of the reflex centers 
associated with locomotion and posture.  
The hypothalamus is the main integration and regulation center for the autonomic nervous system, e.g., 
contains reflex centers associated with temperature regulation. The midbrain contains visual and auditory 
reflexes, which can bring about constriction or dilation of the pupils and evoke a startle reaction to loud 
noises. 
 
The spinal cord of domestic animals constitutes a greater proportion of the CNS (brain and spinal cord) 
than in humans. This reflects the fact that more of the CNS activity in animals is accomplished by reflex 
than by cerebral activity. There is approximately 10 times more spinal cord activity in dogs than in humans. 
 
I.2.5. Physiology of the Autonomic Nervous System 
I.2.5.1. Regulation of Autonomic Nervous System Activity 
The ANS functions to maintain a relatively stable internal body environment, that is, to maintain a state of 
homeokinesis (homeostasis). It does so by regulating the activity of cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and 
glands. The distribution of ANS nerves is widespread, including all viscera. Normally, the regulation of 
ANS activity occurs below the level of consciousness. However, emotional reactions (such as fear or 
excitement) and input from the cerebral cortex also affect ANS activity. - Most organs that are innervated by the ANS have both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations, and 
in most cases the effects of the two divisions are antagonistic. For example, parasympathetic stimulation of 
the heart reduces heart rate, while sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate. The antagonistic actions are 
controlled to bring about appropriate overall regulation of the innervated organ. In the case of the heart, 
relatively high parasympathetic nerve activity to the heart in an animal at rest maintains a low resting heart 
rate. During rest there is little sympathetic nerve activity to the heart. To increase heart rate, such as during 
exercise, parasympathetic nerve activity is first reduced to permit an increase in heart rate, and sympathetic 
nerves to the heart are activated if a further increase in heart rate is necessary for more intense exercise.   --Changes in ANS nerve activity can occur as a result of discrete reflexes. For example, the diameter of the 
pupil of the eye is controlled by an ANS reflex initiated by changes in the amount of light detected by the 
retina. The circular smooth muscle fibers of the iris constrict the pupil and are under the control of 
parasympathetic nerves. Changes in the amount of light reaching the retina initiate a reflex response to 
achieve a precise and proper pupil diameter. -Arterial blood pressure, salivary secretion, secretion of hydrochloric acid by the stomach, urination, and 
defecation are among functions regulated in part by ANS reflexes. - The reflex centers for various ANS reflex arcs are found throughout the CNS. For example, the brainstem 
has several centers regulating blood pressure, and the reflex center for urination is in the sacral region of 
the spinal cord.  -ANS reflexes may use sympathetic nerves, parasympathetic nerves, or both. For example, the ANS reflex 
regulation of blood pressure uses sympathetic nerves to blood vessels and both parasympathetic and 
sympathetic nerves to the heart.  
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB -The sympathetic division of the ANS is primarily responsible for the fight-or-flight response that is 
associated with fear, anxiety, rage, and other strong emotions. The outcomes of this response can be 
predicted by imagining what changes would favor skeletal muscle activity for either fighting or running 
away. Outcomes include increases in heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, and blood flow to skeletal 
muscle; dilation of airways in the lungs (e.g., bronchi); dilation of the pupils; and decreased activity of the 
digestive tract. The fight-or-flight response is a short-term event characterized by high levels of sympathetic 
nerve activity throughout the body. This widespread sympathetic activation is not the result of a discrete 
reflex but is a more general sympathetic activation initiated in response to fear, anxiety, stress, and so on. 
The hypothalamus and amygdala in the brain appear to be especially important sites in the initiation of the 
sympathetic response, but it is not clear how feelings of fear, stress, and so on affect these centers to initiate 
the response. In addition to widespread increases in sympathetic nerve activity, the fight-or-flight response 
includes an increase in the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medullae. 
Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medullae are innervated by preganglionic sympathetic neurons, and these 
cells release their catecholamines when stimulated. In most species the primary catecholamine released by 
chromaffin cells is epinephrine (adrenaline). Epinephrine and norepinephrine in the circulation bind to 
adrenergic receptors throughout the body to amplify the general effects of increased sympathetic nerve 
activity. The blood levels of these catecholamines are relatively low and functionally insignificant when 
animals are not undergoing a strong sympathetic response. 
The list of events in the fight-or-flight response includes dilation of the pupil of the eye. The control of 
pupil size was earlier described as also being controlled by a parasympathetic reflex based on light reaching 
the retina. This is an example of how circumstances may affect which division of the ANS dominates the 
regulation of an organ or gland. If an animal is not undergoing a strong sympathetic response, the 
parasympathetic nerves are the primary regulator of pupil size, but during times of intense stress, 
sympathetic stimulation may dilate the pupil in spite of the animal being in a brightly lit environment. 
 
I.2.5.2. Autonomic neurotransmitters and their receptors 
The postganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic division of the ANS use acetylcholine as a 
neurotransmitter, whereas almost all postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic division use 
norepinephrine. Acetylcholine is also the neurotransmitter used by preganglionic neurons in both the 
sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. The organ response to ANS stimulation depends not only on 
the neurotransmitter being released but also on the type of cell membrane receptor on the cells of the organ. 
Muscarinic and nicotinic are the two general classes of acetylcholine receptors. Nicotinic receptors are 
found on skeletal muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction and in all autonomic ganglia (both sympathetic 
and parasympathetic), where acetylcholine is released by preganglionic neurons. Muscarinic receptors are 
found in most organs innervated by postganglionic parasympathetic neurons. Stimulation of muscarinic 
receptors brings about diverse cellular responses ranging from hyperpolarization of sinoatrial nodal cells to 
slow heart rate to contraction of urinary bladder smooth muscle for urination. Parasympathetic stimulation 
increases salivary gland secretion, stimulates gastrointestinal motility, slows heart rate, and tends to reduce 
cardiac output. These are often undesirable during surgery. Muscarinic receptor antagonists (such as 
atropine) are often used as preanesthetic agents to block peripheral muscarinic receptors and reduce these 
potentially harmful effects of parasympathetic stimulation. 
Adrenergic receptors, which may be stimulated by either epinephrine or norepinephrine, also fall into two 
general classes, α-receptors and β-receptors. However, because of their physiologic and clinical importance, 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AS ANS 301 2023-2024 UB 
the subtypes of α- and β-receptors also must be considered. Stimulation of α1- receptors causes contraction 
of smooth muscle, and stimulation of β2-receptors causes smooth muscle relaxation. Epinephrine has a high 
affinity for β2-receptors, and it is released into the circulation during a strong sympathetic response. The 
β2 effects on smooth muscle of airways and blood vessels supplying skeletal muscles are appropriate for 
fight-or-flight. 
 
 
I.2.6.  Regeneration and Repair in the Nervous System 
In mammals most neurons are fully differentiated at birth, although division of glial cells (including those 
that myelinate axons) continues postnatally. With very few exceptions, neurons are incapable of mitosis, 
and therefore nerve cells lost to injury or disease are not replaced. Axons, however, may regenerate 
following injury if the neuronal cell body is healthy. Axonal regeneration in the CNS does not usually result 
in recovery of function. It is believed that mature oligodendrocytes prevent regrowth and reestablishment 
of meaningful neuronal connections. This is why spinal cord injuries are generally irreversible. The partial 
recovery of function seen over time with some CNS injuries is mostly attributable to recruitment of 
remaining uninjured connections and to the individual’s ability to learn to use those remaining connections. 
Axons in the peripheral nervous system (nerves) are frequently injured by crushing (as in forced extraction 
of a calf during dystocia) or cutting (e.g., wire cuts). Unlike the situation in the CNS, peripheral axons are 
capable of considerable repair. The likelihood that a given nerve injury will undergo functional recovery is 
correlated with (1) how close to the nerve cell body the injury is and (2) whether or not the nerve sheath is 
disrupted. The more proximal a nerve injury, the less likely it is to recover. In fact, axonal injury that occurs 
very close to the cell body may result in death of the neuron. Axonal injuries that preserve the supportive 
tissues of a nerve (e.g., a crushing injury with minimal disruption of the myelin and connective tissue sheath) 
have a better chance of healing than those in which the epineurium is disturbed (e.g., a cut nerve). Minor 
injuries to peripheral nerves may regenerate at 2–4 mm a day, whereas more severe injuries may take many 
months to recover, if they recover at all.

CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS 
When charges are given to some materials, the charges stay at the same spot at the surface of the material. These 
types of material are called electrics or non-conductors. 
Definition: 
 An insulator is a material in which charges do not move from one point to another e.g. rubber, plastic, dry wood, glass etc. 
 A conductor is a material through which charges can easily flow from one point to another e.g. All metals, impure water, liquid 
mercury. 
Home work:  State five applications of (1) conductors and (2) insulators. 
LAWS OF ELECTROSTATICS 
1. The fundamental law of electrostatics states that: unlike charges attract while like charge repel. 
2. Two factors determine the magnitude of the force between two charged bodies.  
These factors are the quantity of charge and their separation. If two charges q1 and q2 are separated by a distance 
r, this implies that the force F between them is inversely proportional to the square of their separation  i.e.

ELECTRIC FIELDS. 
The space around an electric charge where an electric force is experienced is called an electric field. It is represented by 
field lines or lines of force. The direction of the field at any time is point is taken as the direction of the force on a positive 
charge at that point, with the arrow giving the direction of the force.   
Quantity of charge: The amount or quantity of charge carried by all electrons is the same. So, the more electrons an 
object loses or gains, the greater its charge ((+) or (-) charge). Charge is measured in coulombs (C).  Small charges are 
measured in microcoulombs (μC). The quantity of charge, Q, in an object is given as  
Q = n e      
where e = 1.6 x 10-19 C, n = number of electrons,  e = charge on an electron 
In terms of current and time,                  Q = I t 
Exercise: Calculate (i) the quantity of charge and (ii) current that flows pass a point in an electric circuit when 3.0 x 1025 
electrons move through that point in 2 hours. 
Solution: n= 3.0  x 10 25; e = 1.6  x 10-19 C;   Q = n e =

per coulomb in bringing positive charge from the earth to that point.  The 
potential, V, of a charged body is defined as the work done in carrying unit 
charge from zero potential (Earth’s potential) to the charged body. 
CURRENT ELECTRICITY 
ELECTRIC CURRENT 
Definition: 
Electric current I is the rate of flow of electric charges. 
If a quantity of charge, Q passes a section of a conductor in a specific time interval, t, then the current in the 
conductor due to that flow of charge is given by; 
In a conductor, the charges carried are mostly electrons. If the charge on an electron is e, and N electrons pass 
via a given section of a circuit of a conductor in time t, then the total charge:

MAGNETIC FIELDS 
A magnetic field is the space (or region) around a magnet or a current carrying conductor where a magnetic force is 
experienced. It is a vector. It is represented by magnetic field lines drawn so that the line gives the direction of the field at 
that point  
Field lines around a bar magnet 
A magnetic compass is used to plot magnetic field lines. It is placed near one end of a magnet and the positions of the 
ends of the needle are marked on a sheet of paper on which the magnet lies. The compass is then moved so that its needle 
lines up with the previous mark made, and so on. Different field lines are plotted to build up the pattern showing the field 
around the magnet.  
N S 
Note: The spacing between the lines indicates the relative strength of the magnetic field. The closer the lines, the stronger the 
field and the greater is the force which would act on any magnetic pole placed in that region.  
EARTH’S  MAGNETIC FIELD 
The earth possesses a magnetic field and behaves as if a huge bar magnet were buried through its center. 
If there are no other magnetic fields around to affect, a compass needle would align itself with the earth’s magnetic field- 
the N pole end points in the general direction of north.

A current in a wire produces a magnetic field. Reversing the current also reverses the direction of the field.

direction as the current, the direction of turning gives the direction of the field.

A magnetic field is produced when a current is passed through the coil. This magnetizes the core which in turn produces a 
magnetic field about a thousand times stronger than that from the coil alone. As the core is magnetically soft, its 
magnetism is only temporary and is virtually all lost when the current in the coil is switched off. 
Applications of electromagnets: Electric bell, the telephone, and magnetic relay.  
Exercises 
1. Two soft iron pieces are placed inside a solenoid which is then connected to a battery as shown below. 
i. 
ii. 
What happens to the two when the switch is closed? Explain  
What is the effect of opening the switch? Explain 
Solution 
i. 
They move apart because when current flows through the solenoid, the generated magnetic field induces 
magnetism on the rods. The adjacent ends of the rods are of the same polarity and thus repel each other. N pole 
are in the positive end of the battery and south pole are in the negative side. 
ii. 
They lose their magnetism because soft iron easily loses its magnetism.

ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION 
When a wire moves across a magnetic field, a small e.m.f is induced in the wire. This is known as e.m.f induction. If the 
wire forms part of a circuit, the e.m.f causes a current to flow and the current is detected using a galvanometer. The 
induced e.m.f is only present while the wire is moving and cutting through field lines. There is no induced e.m.f if the 
wire is not moving or if it is moving parallel to the field. 
Wire moves parallel to field 
induces zero e.m.f 
Faraday’s law: The e.m.f induced in a conductor is directly proportional to the rate at which the inductor cuts through the 
magnetic field lines. 
Induced e.m.f and current in a coil 
Moving a bar magnet into a coil induces an e.m.f in the coil. In this case, it is the magnet that is moving but the motion 
still causes field lines to be cut by the wire. 
Magnet moved into coil 
Mutual induction  
Induced e.m.f causes 
current to flow 
Mutual induction occurs when an e.m.f is induced in a coil (secondary coil) due to a changing current flowing through 
other coils (primary coil) close to it. 
Soft iron core 
Current  
Electromagnet  
When the current in coil A is switched on, it sets up a magnetic field in coil A. The magnetic field in coil A is transmitted 
to coil B. A changing magnetic field in coil A mutually induces an e.m.f in a circuit B. The induced e.m.f in circuit B 
produces a current which flows in circuit B and causes the pointer of the galvanometer to deflect. 
When the switch is closed, the pointer of the galvanometer deflects to one direction (to the right) and when the switch is 
open, the pointer deflects in the opposite direction (to the left). If coil A is connected to a source of alternating current, 
then a continuous a.c. will be obtained in circuit B. 
Self-induction 
Self-induction occurs when an e.m.f is induced in a coil due to a change in current through the same coil or self-induction 
occurs when an e.m.f is induced in a coil due to a changing current in the same coil. 
Step-up and step down transformers 
It is possible to make the alternating e.m.f in the secondary different from that in the primary by choosing suitable number 
of turns for the coil of a transformer i.e. A transformer can be used to change an a.c voltage from one value to another.

If number of turns in the secondary are less than those in the primary, the transformer is a step-down transformer while if 
the number of turns in the primary is less than those in the secondary it is a step-up transformer. 
 
EXERCISES 
 
A transformer has a primary coil of 6000 turns and a secondary coil of 150 turns. The primary is connected to an a.c of 240V. A 3Ω 
resistor is connected across the secondary. Draw a circuit diagram to show the above arrangement 
Assuming that the transformer is 100% efficient, calculate 
a) The voltage across the resistor

Thermometers 
Different types of thermometer exist for measuring temperature. The 
mercury-in-glass thermometer depends on the change in volume 
of the mercury with hotness. Other types of thermometer 
depend on the change, with hotness, of different physical properties such as 
the electrical resistance of a metal etc. 
 
Heat and Temperature 
Generally, the temperature of a body rises when heat is supplied to it or falls 
when heat is lost. In some cases there is no change in temperature but a 
change in state of the body. 
AGR102notesPart2 
HEAT CAPACITY AND SPECIFIC HEAT 
The heat capacity,C, of a substance is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of that sample by 1°C. From 
this definition, we see that if heat, Q, produces a change,  T, in the temperature of a substance, then  
The specific heat,c, of a substance is the heat capacity per unit mass. Thus, if energy, Q, transferred by heat to mass m of a 
substance changes the temperature of the sample by  T, then the specific heat of the substance is  
Specific heat is essentially a measure of how thermally insensitive a substance is to the addition of energy. 
The energy Q supplied to a mass m of a material, producing a temperature change  T, is calculated as 
Sometimes the heat energy supplied to a substance or lost by a substance does not result in a temperature change but 
rather brings about a change of state. This heat is called latent heat. It is calculated as  
Where L = latent heat. 
Latent heat of fusion Lf  is the term used when the phase change is from solid to liquid (to fuse means “to combine by 
melting”), and latent heat of vaporization Lv is the term used when the phase change is from liquid to gas (the liquid 
“vaporizes”).  
Thermal Conduction 
The energy transfer process most clearly associated with a temperature difference is thermal conduction. In the process, the transfer 
is an exchange of kinetic energy between microscopic particles—molecules, atoms, and electrons—in which less energetic particles 
gain energy in collisions with more energetic particles. Example, if you hold one end of a long metal bar and insert the other end into a 
flame, you will soon feel that the metal end in your hand becomes warm.  
Convection 
The air directly above a flame is heated and expands. As a result, the density of this air decreases and the air rises while the cooler air 
up falls down to the flame where it is also heated. This process generates convection current wherein the heat from the flame is 
transmitted upward.  Energy transferred by the movement of a heated substance is said to have been transferred by convection. 
Radiation 
All objects radiate energy continuously in the form of electromagnetic waves produced by thermal vibrations of their molecules. 
Radiation is the transmission of energy without the need of a material medium e.g. heat from the sun, heat from a flame nearby.  
NUCLEAR PHYSICS 
ATOM 
An atom is the smallest particle that can take part in a chemical reaction. It is made up of three different 
particles: proton, neutron, electron; and described by: ATOMIC NUMBER, Z (number of protons), NEUTRON 
NUMBER, N (number of neutrons); ATOMIC MASS NUMBER, A (number of protons and neutrons) 
Hence,    
A   =    Z  +  N 
ISOTOPES: Isotopes are atoms that have the same atomic (or proton) number but different mass numbers (due to 
different neutron numbers). Isotopes of hydrogen are:

Hydrogen Isotopes 
The isotopes of hydrogen are protium (no neutrons), deuterium (one neutron), and tritium (two neutrons). 
Nuclide: A nuclide is any atom that has a characteristic number of neutrons and protons (i.e. it is a 
modern word for isotope). An atom is generally represented as  
A
 Z                 
X          
where A = mass or nucleon number and Z = atomic or proton number. 
In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. Atomic particles are represented as

Proton:   1

Atoms whose nuclei are unstable are said to be radioactive because the nuclei decompose to smaller more stable ones. 
Radioactivity is the spontaneous decomposition of the unstable nuclei of some atoms.  Radioactive elements give out three 
types of radiations. 
1. Alpha (Α-) Radiation: This refers to the emission of positively charged particles called alpha particles with a 
mass of 4 a.m.u. and a charge of +2. Alpha (α-) particles are He-nuclei (+2
 4 He  ).  
2. Beta (Β-) Radiation: This is the emission of negatively charged particles called beta particles. A beta particle is 
an electron, of charge -1 and negligible mass ( 
    
 a.m.u.). 
3. Gamma (Γ-) Radiation: It is the emission or release of energy in the form of electromagnetic waves called 
gamma (γ-) rays. Gamma rays are waves with shorter wavelengths than x-rays. They have no charge and no mass.

RADIOACTIVE DECAY 
A nucleus that emits a radioactive particle changes into another nuclide. This process is known as radioactive decay. The 
rate of radioactive decay is measured by the number of radioactive particles emitted per second, and is known as the 
activity. The activity depends on the number of undecayed atoms present. Radioactive decay is not affected by changes in 
temperature and pressure.

NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL REGENERATION 
3. Artificial regeneration 
Artificial Regeneration is the planting of tree seedlings or seeds after a timber harvest rather than relying on 
stump sprouts, seeds, and other forms of natural regeneration. Planting is usually one of the final steps after 
other site preparation activities designed to increase plantability, control competition from native vegetation, 
improve growth and increase seedling survival. Artificial regeneration is obtained by two methods: 
• From seeds: Either by direct sowing, or planting the species of interest in nurseries. 
• Vegetatively: Artificial regeneration is also obtained by planting vegetative parts as cuttings. 
The relative importance of artificial regeneration as compared with natural regeneration, depends on a large 
number of factors which determine whether reliance to be placed on the latter or how far to go with its 
replacement by artificial regeneration. 
3.1 Evaluation of Site 
The most important features of the site are those which will determine whether a particular area is suitable for 
planting, and then if it is yes; the chances of success, which species are best adapted to it and what special 
measures are required. The site can be evaluated by site factors or by its vegetation.  
3.1.1 Direct Method 
Site abiotic factors like soil and climate are known, hence site values can be determined. Climatic factors 
include rainfall, temperature, wind, humidity etc. E.g., the maximum and minimum rainfall and the mean 
annual temperature and wind movement should be known. Humidity is also important as it directly influences 
evaporation ad evapotranspiration. The chemical and physical properties of the soil over the area; texture, 
structure, acidity, depth, soil profile, soil moisture, porosity and aerations etc. should also be known. Biotic 
factors are not considered separately as their effects are reflected in the soil and vegetations of the site. 
3.1.2 Indirect Method 
The site can be evaluated by vegetation growing over the site e.g. if iroko (Milicia excelsa) is growing, then 
the site will be good for species having the same requirements, if Prosopis specigera or Cappario apliylla are 
growing, conclusion can be drawn that the rainfall is 10″ per anum etc.  
3.2 Ecological Consideration 
The indigenous species which are already growing are selected for the plantation. The species growing in the 
vicinity i.e., around the area in the neighbouring forest stand will also succeed in the site. If no species is present 
then the exotic species from the areas having the same ecological conditions as the site, can be selected. The 
ecological conditions of the site and the ecological requirements e.g., the ecological niche of the species should 
be compared, if these are similar, then the species are recommended for plantation in the site. 
1 
3.3 Considering the Effect on Site 
The replacement of natural forest by pure plantations of certain species leads to soil and site degradation, both 
directly by erosion and indirectly through changes in the biological processes in the soil. E.g., Some light 
demanding species have open canopy, with leaves which are very hard to decompose and blown away by wind, 
resulting to loss of nutrients and gradually the whole site becomes infertile. On the contrary, the leaves of most 
shade tolerant species easily decompose, hence they replenish soil nutrients faster increasing soil fertility. 
Therefore light tolerant species should be grown together with shade tolerant species to mitigate site 
degradation.  
3.4 System of Management and Relative Cost 
If in a plantation only light tolerant or only shade tolerant species are planted, they grow even-aged stands 
which may result to more production. However, if light tolerant species are planted together with shade tolerant 
species, they would result to an uneven-aged class. If regeneration is mainly for production, then even-aged 
stands are good but if we are regenerating for aesthetics then we will require to have uneven-aged stands. The 
relative cost of plantations and maintenance of different species should be evaluated, and species which have 
the least expenditure should be recommended for planting 
3.5 Spacing of Regeneration Species 
The spacing of species in artificial regeneration is determined by various factors as including light requirement, 
crown size, site fertility etc. 
3.5.1 Method of Stocking (Regeneration) 
Artificial regeneration is effected via two main methods, sowing and planting; 
3.5.1.1 Sowing: In case of sowing closed spacing is required to have more chances of success. 
3.5.1.2 Planting: In case of planting the plants have 80% survival and wider spacing is recommended. 
3.5.2 Grazing Incidence 
By grazing, young seedlings are destroyed by animals and close spacing is necessary to face this danger, 
whereas wider spacing is good where grazing incidence is less. 
3.5.3 Rate of Growth 
In slow growing species close spacing is suitable while in fast growing species the spacing should be wider. 
3.5.4 Site Quality 
Wider spacing is adopted for good quality site while closed spacing is adopted in case of poor sites. 
3.5.5 Crown size 
Species having small crown are planted at close spacing, but spacing should be wider in case of species having 
large crowns. 
2 
3.5.6 Weed Growth in the Area: 
If weeds are growing in the area, the weeds will suppress and may outcompete tree seedlings because weeds 
are better adapted to competition for nutrient, light etc. Closer spacing is required in areas which have weeds, 
and wider spacing is suitable for areas free of weeds. 
3.5.7 Tolerance 
If a species is light tolerant then its spacing will be wider but close spacing is required in cases of shade tolerant 
species. 
3.5.8 Objective 
The objective may be specified and if the plantation is only for firewood then closer spacing will be best, but 
in case of timber production, wider spacing is best to obtain good quality straight boles. 
3.6 Methods of Sowing 
3.6.1 Broadcasting: 
It is the most common and simplest method of sowing in which seeds are scattered throughout the forest area. 
This is the cheapest method but the chances of failure are very high.  
3.6.2 Dibbling 
In this method seeds of bigger size are sown at equal spacing in bits with the help of dibbling rods. The 
advantage in this method is that the seed quantity is half that of the broadcasting method. 
3.6.3 Line Sowing 
The seeds are sown in lines or rows. The soil is sampled to 1 to 2 inches depth and seeds are sown in lines.  
3.6.4 Patch Sowing 
In a roughly circular patch of soil several seeds are sown. Generally, only one plant will be retained in each so, 
any extra ones are weeded out later or used for transplanting to blank patches. The difficulty in this method is 
that, if the seedlings are slow growing ad weeds are growing alongside, intensive weeding should be carried 
out continuously, to prevent the seedlings from being outcompeted. But with quick growing species patch 
sowing may be cheap and effective.  
3.6.5 Ridge and Mound Sowing 
The seeds are sown on ridges, and mounds in case of dry areas to conserve moisture in the raised and loosened 
soil. The advantage of the ridge over the mound is the lesser amount of weeds in ridges as compared to mounds. 
There is a risk of soil wash exposing the roots which may be minimized by not making the ridges too narrow 
and by firming the soil after sowing. 
3.7 Seed Supply 
An adequate supply of good quality seed is a prerequisite for successful artificial regeneration.  
3 
3.7.1 Seed Collection 
3.7.1.1 Quantity Required 
The quantities required must be carefully worked out in advance and reasonable margin be allowed not only 
for resowing failed areas, but also to cover the possibility of shortage of supplies in some species. 
3.7.1.2 Ripeness 
Seed collectors have to be trained to distinguish ripe and good seeds at the time of collection. Ripeness of seed 
is most important.  
3.7.1.3 Agency of Collection 
There are various agencies who collect seeds through forest guards, or contractors and or import seeds to ensure 
best quality and preservation.  
3.7.1.4 Method of Collection 
Seeds should be collected from seed trees immediately natural fruits and or seeds fall commences. There are 
various methods of collection: 
• The fruits and or seeds are collected by climbing up to the trees.  
• Clearing the ground below the tree and the branches are shaken, thus the fruits and or seeds fall down. 
• The simplest method of improving the genetic quality of seed is to collect them from the neighbouring 
forests stands, to an aggregate total estimated to be sufficient to meet the stated goals.  
3.7.1.5 Extraction of Seeds 
Seed extraction means the separation of seeds from dry fruits collected by any one of the above methods. Dry 
fruits require treatments to extract the seeds. The simplest and commonest procedure is to spread the fruits in 
the sun on trays or a clean hard floor until they open up, and then rake, roll or beat as seems best to separate 
the seeds. 
3.7.1.6 Cleaning of seeds 
The dried seeds have to be cleaned of all foreign materials such as fragments of fruits and non-viable seeds 
singled out. Methods will vary with species. Water separation with redrying is a simple method with many 
species. Sieving is sometimes helpful.

FOREST INVENTORY AND MENSURATION (FOR 302) 
Introduction 
Resource inventory is stock taking. Stock taking is an essential aspect of human 
planning, taking into account the available materials in a particular place. Inventory 
in forestry means not only taking stock of trees but also other non-timber produce 
such as wildlife, water, medicinal plants, forest foods, forest health etc.  These have 
stimulated the development of integrated or multi-resource inventories. 
A complete resource inventory must provide the following information depending 
on the objectives of the inventory: 
 Definition of the objectives and information desired. 
 Development of a sampling design and methods of data collection. 
 Data accessing or collection 
 Data analysis and publication 
 Estimation of areas 
 Description of topography 
 Ownership problems 
 Accessibility 
 Transportation facilities 
 Estimation of timber quality and quantity 
 Estimation of growth etc. 
 Recreational resources 
 Wildlife resources 
4 
 Forest health 
 Carbon estimation  
Moreover, if the purpose of inventory is for preparation of a harvesting plan, the 
major emphasis should be on topographical description, determination of 
accessibility and transportation facilities. If the purpose of inventory is for a 
management plan, the major emphasis would be on estimation of timber quantity, 
growth and drain. In forest inventory information are obtained by measuring and 
accessing the tree and various characteristics of the land. 
In executing a forest inventory it is impossible to measure quantities directly such as 
volumes and weights of standing trees. Consequently a relationship is established 
between direct measurable tree or stand characteristics (e.g. DBH, heights) and the 
desired quantity are estimated. At the base of every forest inventory lies a set of 
activities carried out in the forest that are defined as forest mensuration. Forest 
mensuration deals with the determination of dimensions, form, weight, growth, 
volume and age of trees, individually or collectively, and the dimension of their 
products. 
Forest enumeration is normally defined as counting, singly or together, of 
individuals of one or more species in a forest crop and their classification by species, 
size, site condition, DBH etc. Unlike mensuration enumeration is not carried out in 
sawmills or gantries. It is counting of growing stock such as before logging. 
To some extent the availability of financial resources and human capacity 
determines the methodologies to be used. In a best-case scenario, multi-purpose 
field-based forest inventories collect primary data on tree species, diameter and 
5 
height, land use, and more, combining permanent sample plots with a remote sensing 
survey to assess forest cover and other parameters. 
Field survey 
In a field survey, forest inventory teams collect data on the ground. For a relatively 
small forest area, such as a logging coupe, it is possible (and often required) to 
conduct 100 percent inventories (also called full-cover or wall-to-wall inventories) 
in which all trees in the stand (usually above a specified minimum diameter) are 
measured. For larger-area inventories, such as at the landscape, provincial or 
national level, a 100 percent inventory is likely to be impractical and prohibitively 
expensive. A sampling strategy is therefore required whereby measurements are 
made in permanent and/or temporary sampling units, and those measurements are 
used subsequently to estimate values for the entire forest area. The sample area is 
the total area of all sampling units in which measurements are made. 
The sampling procedure can be random, but a systematic sampling is usually more 
efficient, as this tends to provide better representation of the distribution of land uses 
and forest types. Sampling can also be pre-stratified in order to intensify the sample 
in strata that are more heterogeneous or of higher priority, thus increasing the 
precision of estimates where it is most required. The sampling units may be stands, 
plots, strips or points, and plots may be circular, rectangular or square (or some other 
shape) and of fixed or variable size. Plot size is determined according to the expected 
number of measurements of the parameters of interest. For example, plots for 
measuring small trees can sometimes be smaller than plots for measuring larger 
trees, as small trees often are more frequent than larger trees (and therefore a similar 
number of stems can be measured in a smaller area). The number of plots is 
determined by the need for statistical precision, especially for key parameters, and 
6 
by cost and time constraints. More time and effort is usually required to measure a 
widely dispersed set of plots than plots arranged in clusters (i.e. ‘cluster sampling’) 
Data collection 
Data collection can be by field surveys, remote sensingGround trothing etc. Tools 
include tapes, calipers, ranging poles, GPS, drones, smart phones, aircrafts, 
satellites, cameras etc. 
Measurements and observations in the field are made on individual trees (and 
shrubs) as well as on the whole forest ecosystem. Common tree measurements and 
observations are: diameter, height, stem form, health condition and taxonomical 
species. A variety of instruments and tools is available for measuring tree 
parameters, depending on budget and expertise. Diameter – Typically, the tree stem 
diameter is measured over bark at a height of 1.3 m above the ground commonly 
referred to as breast height (hence the expression diameter at breast height – dbh). 
DBH is equal to 1.3m. For special cases (e.g. trees with irregular form or trees 
growing on a slope), See later notes. Equipment: Diameter tape, scale stick, caliper, 
Spiegel-Relaskop, GPS with compass and others. 
Height – Tree height is the vertical height of a tree from the ground to the top of the 
tree. Commercial bole height is the length of the bole from the stump to the height 
of the bole at the point of the first stem fork or smallest merchantable diameter (i.e. 
the minimum bole diameterable to be used as timber). The measurement of tree 
height can be particularly difficult in forests where tree tops are not visible because 
of the dense canopy (e.g. in closed tropical forests). Given that it is far more costly 
to measure tree height than dbh, tree height is often measured for only a subsample 
of trees. On the basis of such a subsample the relationship between dbh and tree 
7 
height can be modelled and applied to predict the height of all trees in the sample. 
However this will give less accurate results than actual height estimates. 
Both total height and commercial bole height can be estimated using a variety of 
tools, and the more accurate height measurement tools (clinometers) measure angles 
and enables the user to determine the height of a tree when standing at a given 
distance. Refer to notes ahead. Equipment: clinometer, hypsometer, Spiegel 
relascope, rangefinder, scale stick, measurement pole. 
Health and vitality of forest ecosystems can be determined through selected 
ecological indicators. Those indicators are mainly observations on the presence or 
absence of affecting biotic or abiotic agents and environmental problems (or their 
symptoms) as well as overall assessment of the condition of forest and trees. They 
are recorded in the plots either at tree level (overall tree condition and crown 
condition, causative agents) or at forest stand level (environmental problems 
observed and the degree of severity and trends). The information on forest health 
and vitality is derived from both field observations as well as from interviews with 
local population and key informants (PRA). 
Biological diversity 
Good identification of tree species is a fundamental prerequisite of any forest 
inventory. In many cases it is much more serious to be wrong in the identification of 
the species of a tree then to make a mistake about any of its other characteristics. In 
species-rich tropical forests species identification is often a challenging task, due to 
the restriction of specialized botanical expertise to a few taxonomists. A 
recommendation is to take samples of parts of the trees, preferably including fertile 
material like flowers, seeds and fruits, to be identified by experts in a laboratory. 
Detailed photographs of similar material could serve the same purpose. To limit the 
8 
efforts some inventories focus only on those species considered “important”, be so 
for their commercial value, their role in ensuring biodiversity or other reasons.  
A comprehensive assessment of biological diversity would then include results on 
dbh and height by species, their spatial distribution, forests structure and 
observations of indicator species (both flora and fauna). 
Estimating growing stock and biomass 
Volume or biomass estimates for individual trees in the sample area are aggregated 
to derive the total inventoried tree volume in the sample area. The growing-stock 
density (m3 per hectare) and biomass density (tonnes per hectare) can be calculated 
by dividing the total inventoried tree volume or biomass by the sample area. Some 
volume functions with measurements at the stand level (e.g. basal area) generate 
estimates of volume density directly. 
Carbon stock inventory: Measuring the amount of above ground biomass or the 
total mass of living organisms in forests. Tis includes trees, leaves, roots and other 
plant material.  The amount of carbon stored in the forest is calculated by multiplying 
the biomass by the carbon content of each type of biomass. 
This information can be used to understand the role of forests in the global carbon 
cycle and estimate the amount of carbon that is stored in forest around the world. It 
is also used to assess the impact of human activities on forest and the world at large 
such as global warming and carbon sequestration 
Environmental and socioeconomic services 
These are essential functions provided by forests and trees. For large area inventories 
these services are important to assess and monitor in order to provide decision
9 
makers with needed information to improve the livelihoods of local people and to 
protect soil and water. The information on these services is collected through field 
observations and through interviews with local people and other key informants. 
Digital Resource inventory 
Remotely sensed data provide opportunities to update forest inventories, estimate 
inventory attributes, capture forest disturbances, and to estimate nontraditional forest 
characteristics such as habitat and biodiversity. Remotely sensed data are 
dereferenced and are therefore easily integrated with GIS databases. For example, 
forest disturbances related to insect damage or fire, that are captured in remotely 
sensed data, can be incorporated as unique attributes for individual polygons in an 
existing forest inventory database. These inputs aid in maintaining the currency of 
the forest inventory database, and, as a result, contribute to the informed 
management of remaining forest resources. 
Data collection using digital technologies include the use of GPS, GIS, LiDAR and 
remote sensing. Digital forest inventory can be used to create 3D models of forest, 
calculate volumes of timber and assess the condition of the forest. 
LiDAR (light detecting and ranging) is a remote sensing technology that uses lasers 
to measure the distance between objects. It works on reflectance –time taken for 
10 
laser pulses to be reflected back. Diameter at Breast height can be measured digitally 
by digital calipers or lasers. It is very good for trees in difficult terrains or have 
irregular trunks. Tree heights can be measured digitally using LIDAR. Stereo 
photometry can also be used. This includes taking two or more photos of the tree 
from two or more different angels, then using a software to create a 3D model of the 
tree. The tree height can be calculated by measuring the distance from the base of 
the tree to the top of the tree. 
Satellite imagery and aerial photogrammetry 
This is the use of satellites and low flying, light air crafts and helicopters to obtain 
images. Satellite images and aerial photos are interpreted to obtain useful data in 
resource inventory. Aerial photographs have s scale of 1:5000 and larger. 
Satellite Imagery (LANDSAT) and aerial photos can be used for the following 
purposes: 
 Mapping different vegetation types and forest classification 
  Monitoring changes in ground cover of vegetation and the risk of soil erosion 
and land degradation in the different types of rangeland 
 Mapping the extent of savannah bush burning during the dry season. Burning 
also influences the distribution  of wild game at different periods of the year 
 Breeding areas and preferred grazing points, migratory routes and the zones 
of wildlife concentration at different times of the year. 
 Delineation of forest boundaries 
 Identification of diseased vegetation  
 Hydrological survey 
 Land use, livelihoods and land tenure problem solving. 
11 
Tree Allometry. This is the establishment of quantitative relations between some 
key characteristic dimensions of trees and other properties. Eg DBH and volume (in 
volume tables). It involves the use of equations, models and functions to describe 
the quantities, relationship between various types of parameters. In combination with 
the tree inventory data, allometric quations can be used to estimate tree volumes, 
biomass and ultimately, the growing stock biomass and carbon stocks of forests at 
various scales. Allometric models can be species specific or for a group of species 
and they can be generically derived for different forest types.  
12 
FOREST INVENTORY 
Stock taking is an essential aspect of human planning taking into account the 
available materials in a particular place. It is an important aspect of forest 
management, Inventory in forestry does not only mean taking stock of trees but also 
other non-timber forest products i.e. wildlife, medicines, fruits etc. It also involves 
taking stock of land, describing geographical locations, maps of areas including soil 
types and forest ownership. 
Planning for inventory 
This is an essential part of inventory usually done in the office based on all what has 
to be done in the field and this is considered an important factor.  
What to consider when planning for a forest inventory 
1) Kind of information to be collected. This depends on the objectives of the 
inventory and this must be well stated from the beginning to the end.  
2) Consider the time available for the inventory. Some inventories need to be 
carried out within a very short period while others will not be completed in 
two or more years. 
3) Consider the funds available for the project 
4) Consider the availability, capacity and category of staff to be required for the 
project. 
5) Logistics i.e. transportation, accommodation, feeding facilities to be used by 
staffers. 
6) Required maps and tables 
13 
7) In what ways would you want to present your results-maps, volume tables or 
yield tables? 
8) What form of data processing procedure do you require-simple means, 
ANOVA? 
9) What are the materials to be used- computers (hard and software), GPS, 
trackers, immobilizers, datting guns etc. 
Mapping in Forestry 
Inadequate information on availability, type, location and extent of natural 
resources, as well as the capability to monitor the progress and impact of forestry 
projects is one of the most important weaknesses in forest management in 
Cameroon. In tourism, it has been acknowledged that the attraction of any country 
as a tourist destination depends largely on the effectiveness, convenience and 
reliability of its infrastructural and social services, particularly accommodation, 
transportation, communication and security. Cartography is very important in the 
appraisal of these. 
Remote Sensing Survey 
Remote sensing has important applications to forestry and agriculture, one of which 
is the detection of diseases. Sick vegetation is easily identified on the colour 
composite. Using repetitive satellite coverage, it is possible to detect diseases or fire 
early enough. Using digital multispectral data, the computer classification of several 
forest types may be done, making it possible to establish not only the extent or 
acreage of each type, but also the location, 
A remote sensing survey (e.g. using data from air-borne or satellite-borne sensors) 
can be used for either full-cover or sampling approaches. In a sample-based 
approach, observations are made in sampling units (sample area), while in a full
cover approach the entire area of interest (e.g. a landscape, province or nation) is 
14 
surveyed. Remote sensing observations can be used in particular to determine the 
extent of different land-cover (vegetation mapping) or land-use classes. This can 
greatly assist in extrapolating volume and biomass densities generated by field-based 
measurements over large areas and over time in repeated assessments to estimate 
changes in total volume and biomass stocks, and to stratify the analysis of field data 
Radar and laser-derived space-borne or air-borne remote sensing can be used to 
capture data for estimating both volume and biomass stocks. The accuracy of these 
methods depends a lot on the ability to calibrate and validate the measurements with 
field data, and the technologies are still experimental and relatively expensive, but 
show promise, particularly for areas that are difficult to access in the field. Satellite 
data backed up by research reaffirms the positive effects of CO2 on forest net 
primary productivity (Callaway et al., 2010), and large timber inventories (Perez
Garcia et al., 2002). Other techniques such as tracking (wildlife telemetry) such as 
VHF radio tracking, satellite tracking, GPS tracking are used in wildlife census. 
GIS in mapping of forests.  
Forest that have been classified as protected areas or logging concessions, 
community forests are usually demarcated with physical boundaries using the 
geographic information system (GIS). The global positioning system (GPS) receiver 
is used in data collection (GPS waypoints and tract, polygons etc.). Sample plots and 
trees in forests are mapped using GPS way points.  GPS waypoints of trees are 
recorded for subsequent studies such as measurement of yield (CAI and MAI). 
Surface areas of forests that serve as catchment areas are also monitored using GIS. 
Encroachment into farms and desert encroachment/advancement are also monitored 
using mapping. Land uses, logging quotas, hunting quotas can also be delineated 
using GIS. Overlaying layers of different maps using GIS can merge maps. I.e. one 
map can show extent of farm encroachment, rivers, land use etc. Camera traps are 
15 
also in use. This data is processed by a GIS software e.g. Map Source.                        
The use of digital methods have an advantage over traditional methods in that it 
gives reliable and accurate results, permits consistent and regular updating of 
database, reduces, time and cost of the inventory 
Therefore forests are mapped for the following reasons: 
 Resources availability 
 Monitoring deforestation 
 Habitat modification 
 Limits e.g.- logging and hunting quotas 
 Encroachment (farm/forest boundaries) 
 Vegetation types 
 Land use 
 Tourism  
 Land suitability/soil maps 
 Sampling (sample plots with sample trees) 
 Volume and biomass densities 
 Home ranges and territories. 
16 
Forest mensuration. 
Forest mensuration is concerned with the measurement of a tree as a stand (collection 
of trees) or primary products (e.g. round logs) sawn wood gotten from them and the 
estimation of growth. This means in effect that forest mensuration deals with the 
determination of the volume of logs, trees and stands and with the study of increment 
and yields. 
Mensuration also takes care of measurement problems of wildlife management, 
water sheds (water sources or water catchment) management, insect and disease 
incidences, services such as recreation and in fact any of the mensurational aspect 
of multiple land use. However, emphases of this lecture will be on two points of 
view, namely: 
1. The principles which can provide the foundation for measurement problems 
in forestry. 
2. The forestry requirement to deal with the growth and yield of forest plants. 
In recent years, the application of statistical theories and the use of computers in data 
processing have been incorporated into forest mensuration. 
Importance of forest inventory and mensuration in 
forestry 
Forest inventory data are the primary information source for forest management. 
Forest inventories are required to derive the information for resource evaluation 
enabling management decisions at a variety of levels, such as harvest plans through 
to the development of provincial or state level strategies. The production of a forest 
inventory data set follows a series of stages, the ultimate being the development of 
a digital spatial database. Forest inventory, stored and manipulated in a geographic 
17 
information system (GIS), is a key information source for operational-level planning 
and strategic-level planning and management. 
The main object of measurement of individual trees is to estimate the quantity of 
timber, firewood and other forest produce. Forest management provides quantified 
information for intelligent decision making in forestry. In the varied management 
activities the forester is faced with the necessary task of making decisions for 
example: 
1. Which silvicultural system will result in better regeneration or growth of a 
particular forest? Which system is best for the type of growth/increment of 
the trees? 
2. Which species is most suitable for afforestation programmes? What is the 
growth rate and pattern of the trees? 
3. Is there sufficient timber in an area to make it economical to harvest or 
establish a forest industry i.e. is the forest viable? A forest may have many 
trees but not good boles and form. 
4. Is the price offered for a forest land satisfactory? Is there going to be profitable 
for the buyer? 
5. Is a given area sufficiently worthwhile for the management of wildlife to 
warrant investment of such money for that purpose? The types of plants 
(pasture/browse) and their growth patterns. 
6. For regulation of yield, from which research conclusions are drawn, harvest = 
growth? I.e. sustained yield principle. 
7. For evolving and implementing satisfactory policy the nation needs to know 
location and extent of forest estate. 
18 
To make meaningful decisions for these problems, the forester needs information. 
This information should be expressed in quantifiable terms, in this sense therefore 
forest mensuration consists of the application of measurement principles to obtain a 
quantifiable information for decision making for growth and yields of stands.

Importance of accuracy and precision in mensuration 
Accuracy refers to the success of estimating the true value of a quantity while 
precision is the degree to which measurements approach or estimate the average. It 
gives consistent results from repeated measurements, e.g. estimating the height of a 
tree that is truly 20m high and you have the following results for 5 readings: 18.5, 
18.6, 18.7, 18.5, and 18.7. The accuracy of the instrument is poor but the precision 
is high. Accuracy is poor because 18 is not very close to 20, but the differences in 
the different readings are not much. They are close to the average 18.6. 
Factors affecting accuracy 
 Characteristics of trees 
 Varying methods and conditions of felling and conversion. 
21 
 Personal bias of the estimator 
 Biological characteristics of the forest and terrain. 
 The use to which the measurements are to be put. 
 Cost of the exercise 
Linear measurements 
Land measurement. Land measurements require two kinds of linear determination 
namely horizontal and vertical distances. Vertical distances (altitude) can be 
determined in the field by spirit levelling, trigonometric leveling and barometric, 
airborne controlled system, air profile recorders. Elevation can also be determined 
by stereoscopic pair.   
Horizontal distance is the length between points in a plane parallel to the horizon.  
Horizontal or slope distance can be determined by direct measurements with tapes 
by various application of triangulation or by instrument using speed of sound and 
light waves (remote sensing). 
Generally direct horizontal or slope distances are measured either by an engineering 
tape or surveyor’s tapes. Most direct measurements are made with engineer steel 
tape. The surveyors’ chain is a steel tape of 22m length and divided into hundreds 
of lines. The GPS can be used in measuring all linear measurements. 
Diameter measurement  
Diameter measurement consists of measuring the length of a straight line passing 
through the center of the circle or sphere terminating at each end at the circumference 
or surface. The most common diameter measurement required in forestry are made 
on a tree woody portions namely the main stem of a standing tree, its branches, or 
cut portions. The basic importance of diameter measurement is that it is one of the 
22 
direct measurable dimensions (parameter) from which cross-sectional area and 
volume can be computed. 
Diameter at Breast Height 
For convenience of measurement and to facilitate comparison, diameters of standing 
trees are measured at a fixed height termed Breast Height. Known as DBH, the 
Diameter at Breast Height is defined as the average stem diameter, outside bark, 
at a height 4.5 feet, that is 4 feet 6 inches (approximately 1.3metre), above ground. 
Measurement – DBH is usually measured with tree caliper or diameter tape. Tree 
caliper held at breast height provides easy and quick measurement of DBH. For 
ordinary work a single reading of caliper will suffice. However, since tree cross 
sections are not exactly circular, two caliper readings at right angles should be 
made and the average may be recorded as DBH. 
For a tree on a slope 1.3m should be measured on the uphill side of the tree. 
23 
Tree diameter classes are used e.g. trees of diameter 7-9 =8, 9-11 = 10. 
24 
The main object of diameter is to estimate the volume of the trees. The volume of a 
tree is dependent on diameter or girth at breast height, total height and form factor. 
DBH = 2r, where r is the radius 
Girth = perimeter of stem at breast height = 2Πr 
DUB = DOB – 2t 
g = g׳ - 2Πt 
Where g = gub, g׳= gob, t = bark thickness 
Effect of irregularity of form in diameter measurement 
The woody part of a tree commonly approach a circular form in cross-section and 
for many measurement purposes are assumed to be so. However, the cross-sectional 
shape frequently depart from the circular and at times this essentiality may assume 
importance. The main objective in the measurement of stem diameter is to 
determine the cross-sectional area at the point of measurement. When the stem 
is regular, no problem is encountered. Single diameter or circumference will suffice. 
For the case where the cross-section is not regular, the practical purposes, the 
formula for the area of a circle is not used. The problem is to find a diameter which 
will yield closest approximation to the true area.

Although in some cases the cross-section may be completely irregular, to obtain the 
tree cross-sectional area of an elliptical stem, the approximate average is the 
geometric mean.

 In the case of irregular shaped cross-section, the appropriate diameter is used. There 
does not seem to be any conclusion for the selection of any one proposed method as 
best for diameter measurement of irregular shapes. Consequently, for practical 
purposes the best practice is to use the procedure recommended for elliptical shapes 
method. The volume of a tree is dependent on the diameter and girth at breast height.

Cross-sectional measurement 
The area of a plane passed through the stem of a tree at right angel to its longitudinal 
axis is called its cross-sectional area. 
Axis 
If the X-section is taken at breast height of a standing tree, it is called the basal 
area. 
The total basal area of all or specific classes of trees in a unit area of land such as 
basal area per hectare is a useful characteristic of a forest stand. It is directly related 
to stand volume and is also a measure of stand density. 
For a circular tree the formulae for the X-sectional area is as follows: 
g = π/4 d2 
Since d = circumference / π → Circumference = πd 
g = C2/4 π 
Where g = tree cross-sectional area 
d = diameter 
C = circumference 
Since diameter at this level dbh is commonly measured in centimeter, the basic 
formulae for a circular tree can be modified to express the result in meters. The basal 
area g can also be expressed in the formulae: 
28 
g = π (dbh)2/4 
Where the cross-section is elliptical measurements of major and minor diameter for 
computation. 
The area therefore for an elliptical structure is given as:  
da
 db 
G = π/4 x da db 
Height Measurement 
Tree height 
Total Height of a standing tree is the perpendicular distance from the tip of the 
leading shoot to the ground level. In comparison, merchantable tree height means 
usable portion of the tree stem, that is, the section expected to be utilized in a 
commercial logging operation. Other tree heights include: 
 Bole height- distance between ground level and crown point. Crown point is 
the position of the first crown forming living or dead branches 
 Commercial bole height- the height fit for utilization as timber. 
 Stump height- top of stump to ground after felling (20 – 30cm) 
 Stumpage value- value of tree before felling. 
Objective of measuring tree height 
29 
 Heights at known intervals of age give a measure of productivity of the site. 
 To find out site quality in general 
  Heights of selected trees may be required for application of volume tables 
and yield tables 
 To determine rate of increment of height. 
Method of measurement of Height 
Methods of measurement employ simple principles of Geometry or 
Trigonometry and assume that trees are perpendicular to the ground. 
Instruments used for measuring tree heights are collectively known as 
hypsometers. 
The basic trigonometric principle used in hypsometers is illustrated in the 
accompanying diagram. Use SOHCAHTOA (sine = opposite /hypothanous, cosine= 
adjacent/hypotanous tangent = opposite/adjacent 
30 
The observer is stationed at a fixed horizontal distance D from the base of the tree. 
On a level ground or on gentle terrain, his horizontal (level) line of sight will 
usually divide the tree height into two segments A and B. When the Observer views 
the base and the top, the line of sight makes angles a (angle of depression) and b 
(angle of elevation) respectively with the horizontal line. 
Then Tree Height = A + B = D x (tan a + tan b) … (A) 
Abney level and several altimeters operate on this principle. Using the above 
relation these instruments give height readings directly at fixed horizontal distances 
(D) from the tree. 
Accuracy of Measurement: Accuracy of height measurement based on formula (A) 
above depends on the following factors. 
1. Accuracy with which it is possible to determine the horizontal distance D 
2. The Observer finds a position from which tree top and foot of the tree are clearly 
visible. 
Measurement on a mountainous terrain such as a montane forest (Mt 
Cameroon) 
In mountainous terrain, the observer’s position may be either above the top of the 
tree or below the base of the tree. 
31 
Fig. a 
Fig b 
In both the cases illustrated above, the level line of sight does not intersect the 
tree and the horizontal distance D=OR is not measurable. 
Modification of Formula A 
32 
For height measurement in mountainous terrain the Formula (A) requires to be 
modified. In the first case (Fig. a), the angles of sight to the top and to base are both 
angles of depression. It is obvious from the diagram that the tree height will be 
obtained by taking difference between the two readings. Formula (A) gets modified 
as follows. 
Tree Height = D x (tan a – tan b) ----- (B) 
In the second case (Fig. b ), the angles of sight to the top and base are both angles 
of elevation and here also the tree height will be obtained by taking difference of 
two readings as shown below. 
Tree 
Height 
= D x (tan b – tan a) ……….. (C) 
It may be noted that since the horizontal distance D (= OC) is not measurable in 
either of the two cases, D should be found out from the following relation. 
D 
= 
OT 
x 
cos 
a 
…………. 
(D) 
The distance OT which is the distance along the slope to the top of the tree can be 
measured, and thus D can be found out. Once D is determined, the tree height can 
be calculated from formula (C) as the case may be. 
Measuring tree volume 
Volume is expressed in cubic units which are derived from any of the fundamental 
units of length, e.g. M3 .  
Volume (M3)= Height (M)  X Basal Area (M2). 
Volume determination methods in forest measurement can be classified as follows:  
1. Using standard formulae 
2. Integration 
3. Liquid displacement 
33 
4. Graphical representation 
5. Volume tables

Tree shape: For the purpose of measurement of wood, the portion of tree which is 
above ground, that is, the stem and crown, is of consideration. The size and height 
of the crown and its distinction from the stem depend on many factors like species, 
age, stand density etc. Trees take different forms and shapes depending on the 
conditions under which they are grown. Again trees of the same species of different 
ages will have different shapes. 
Taper:  
34 
Trees are found to taper. In other words, the diameter and girth of a tree gradually 
reduce from base to top. However, as one goes along the height of a tree, the taper 
is not uniform. The degree of taper varies from part to part and thus leads to different 
shapes of the various parts of the stem. 
Complex Form:  
Since the tree form or shape is complex, measuring tree volume 
with accuracy becomes a difficult task. The only accurate means of measuring tree 
volume is to fell a tree, submerge the various parts in water by turn, and calculate 
the total volume of displaced water. It is, however, obvious that for the purpose of 
management this method of submerging is not feasible and not advisable either. 
Tree parts resemble some geometrical solids: Forest managers therefore try to 
estimate the tree volume by taking linear measurements and applying the 
properties of geometrical solid bodies to which the tree parts tend to approximate. 
It may be borne in mind therefore that calculation of tree volume based on such 
linear measurements is only an estimation of tree volume. 
Parts of a tree stem tend to approximate truncated parts of some known 
geometrical shapes. The base of the tree tends to be neiloid while the tip tends to 
be conoid. The main part of the bole tends to be paraboloid. 
35 
Volume of Stem wood: In order to find the volume of stem wood, volume of 
individual segments may be calculated and the sum of such volumes will give the 
total volume. 
Thus from figure above, the total stem volume or trunk volume of the tree may be 
computed from the following relation. 
Trunk volume = Volume of segment AB (Neiloid frustum) + Volume of segment 
BC (Paraboloid frustum) + Volume of segment CD (cone). 
Formula of geometrical solids:  
36 
While calculating the volume of individual sections, formula for volume of the 
corresponding geometrical solids may be employed. Formulae and diagrams of 
some geometric solids are given. 
In practice, for the purpose of measurement, a stem or log is presumed to have the 
form of a truncated paraboloid, that is, frustum of a paraboloid. Thus formula of 
paraboloid frustum can be employed to find the stem volume, taking the stem as one 
section in the shape of a paraboloid frustum.

Form Factors – Form factor is defined as the ratio of the volume of a tree to the 
volume of a cylinder having the same length and cross-section as the tree. 
Firewood  
Firewood is normally cut into 2.5 feet (approximately 75 cm) long billets and stacked 
for measurement. Firewood stack has the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped. In 
general, dimensions of firewood stack are as given below.

Yield Assessment 
Average Tree Volume  
Previous lessons have described how volume of individual trees can be measured or 
estimated. For the purpose of management, however, foresters are more interested 
in estimation of total volume of a tree stand or a forest coupe. A forester thus requires 
average volume of a tree having dimensions within specified range. He takes help 
of volume table which gives average volume of standing trees of various sizes and 
species. 
Volume Table  
It is a statement in tabular form showing average volume of trees by diameter 
(girth), height or form classes. 
Kinds of Volume Table – Volume Tables are of following three kinds.  
1. Local volume Table – applicable to one forest only, e.g. montane forest on 
Mount Cameroon, Southern Bakundu Forest. 
2. Regional Volume Table – applicable to a number of forests in a locality. E.g. 
Fako Division, depending of variability of forest in the area??? 
3. General Volume Table – applicable to forests over a large geographical area. Eg. 
Forests of Cameroon. 
Choice of variable 
The physical factors or variables which determine the volume of a tree are 
diameter (girth), height and form. A volume table gives average tree volume 
corresponding to values of one or more of these variables. The choice of independent 
43 
is 
variable against which values of volume will be shown as dependent variable in the 
table 
guided more by ease and speed of application than by 
accuracy. This is best served by volume tables based on breast height dimensions. A 
volume table based on bhd (breast height diameter), however, presumes that trees 
having same bhd have the same height and form and therefore the same volume. The 
presumption is not always correct, as these variables depend on many factors like 
age, site qualities and conditions of growth. Thus in order that a volume table based 
on a single variable should be reasonably accurate, it should be applied to strictly 
limited conditions, i.e. site A based on whose parameters the volume table was 
prepared and the site B where the table is applied should have same productive and 
ecological value and trees grown under same silvicultural system. If it is possible to 
measure all the variables by simple measurement, a table based on all three variables 
will be much more accurate and applicable on wider areas than the one based on 
single variable. 
Preparation of Volume Table based on single variable –  
The tables based on single variable of breast height dimensions are normally local 
volume tables. 
The data from a large number of trees is required. Trees felled in successive years 
may be used for this purpose. Breast height measurement is taken while trees are 
standing. After the trees are felled and logged into several segments, then lengths of 
segments and diameters (girth) segments at desired sections are measured to 
calculate volume of individual trees. The data of breast height diameter (girth) and 
corresponding volume are then tabulated in a table. A typical data table is shown 
below. 
44 
Table 1: Using DBH only 
It may be noted that in a data table prepared on measurements of a large number of 
trees though the values of volume show an increasing trend with increasing g.b.h, 
the increase is not uniform and in individual cases may exhibit considerable 
variations from the growth trend. It is therefore necessary to transfer the data on a 
graph by plotting g.b.h values along x axis and the corresponding volumes along y 
45 
axis. The representative points will appear distributed within narrow limits and a 
mean curve may be drawn as shown below. The volume table is then prepared from 
the graph. If it is intended to prepare a table showing volume by 10 cm girth class, 
then values of y –coordinates (volumes) may be read against x-coordinate values 
(g.b.h) of 65 cm, 75cm, 85cm, 95cm and so on from the graph (e.g. Fig 1). It may 
be noted that volume tables give volume under bark against over bark 
dimensions (g.bh).

If DBH is 8, height is 2, volume will be 37 cubic units (m3). 
Application of MS Office Excel – The following graph has been drawn with the 
help of MS Office Excel software programme. The data in Table I under the two 
columns of g.b.h and volume are selected and with the help of ms office excel a 
46 
scattered diagram is plotted. The said software also enables to draw a trend line based 
on the points plotted. The trend line will represent the mean curve referred to above.  
Figure 1. Graphical representation 
47 
Table 3: Using girth class 
Application of volume table using girth class 
If the tree stand whose volume is required to be estimated, g.b.h over bark of each 
tree is measured. The trees are then grouped in girth classes. Volume corresponding 
to each girth class is known from the volume table. Then number of trees in each 
girth class is multiplied by the corresponding volume obtained from the table. The 
product will give volume in the respective girth classes. It is often done for different 
48 
species. Sum of the volumes in the various girth classes and the different species 
will give total volume of the stand or the growing stock.  
Increment of individual Trees 
Increment – Increment is defined as growth in height, diameter and volume in 
relation to time. 
Current Annual Increment  
Annual growth is known as current annual increment (CAI). Normally it is used in 
connection with growth in volume. Thus increase in volume for one year is the 
current annual increment. Since annual growth in volume is small and difficult to 
measure, often average annual growth over a small period of time (5 to 10 years) is 
measured and referred to as current annual increment. 
Mean Annual Increment  
Mean Annual Increment is defined as the ratio of total tree volume at any point of 
time to total age. 
Thus if V is the volume of a tree at an age of Y years, then 
CAI = v = volume put on during the 1-year period between (Y-1) and Y years of 
age; and MAI = v/Y. 
MAI changes with different growth phases in a tree’s life, being highest in the 
middle years and then slowly decreases with age. 
Determination of Age  
By definition it is clear that MAI cannot be calculated without determining the age. 
From records  
49 
The most accurate method to know the age of a standing tree is from records. Thus 
if we have plantation journal, we can easily know the age of trees of the plantation. 
From Annual Rings 
Another accurate method of knowing age is to fell the tree and count annual rings 
on the stump. The annual rings, however, are not clearly visible in all species. The 
number of rings will give the number of years the tree has taken to grow from the 
section of cut to its present height. Therefore the number of years the average 
seedling takes to reach the height of section of cut has to be added to the annual rings 
counted to know the total age. 
50 
Determination of age of woods (Stands) 
If records are available, then the most reliable means to know the age is to consult 
these records. Otherwise, age of the woods has to be determined from age of 
individual trees. In case of even-aged wood, age of a single tree would give age of 
the wood. In case of irregular woods, age of several sample trees may be found out 
and mean age of the wood may be calculated from those of the sample trees. 
Stand (wood) structure 
Even-aged woods Even aged woods are those in which all the trees are of same 
age. Examples are plantations or coppice crops established after clear felling. 
Regular woods (stands) – Regular woods are those where despite age difference 
the individual trees show uniform height before attaining maturity. They usually 
originate from natural regeneration with short regeneration period. They are also 
often called even-aged. 
Irregular woods (stands) - Irregular woods are those which exhibit large number 
of age gradations intermixed and varying heights and crowns throughout the 
rotation. Usually they originate from natural regeneration allowing long regeneration 
period. 
Yield Tables 
Yield can be in terms of growth in diameter, height, basal area, biomass etc. yield in 
forest mensuration is measured over time or age. In talking about age it is customary 
to refer to even aged stands and so yield tables are often constructed for even aged 
forests. 
51 
An Yield table is a tabular statement which displays the course of development of 
an even-aged wood from an early stage to the age of rotation at periodic intervals of 
five or ten years. It is a tabular representation of volume per unit area expected at 
different ages i.e. per hectare for even aged stands according to age and other 
conditions as size classes, stand density and height. A yield table should therefore 
show the following items for any given area: 
1)The number of trees 
2) Mean d.b.h or g.b.h 
3) Total basal area 
4) Mean height 
5) Volume of main crop 
6) Volume of thinning 
7) Form factors 
Sometimes an yield table may be required to show the current annual 
increment (CAI) and the mean annual increment (MAI). 
Uses (application of yield tables) 
1) Determining the volume and increment of stands 
2) For site quality determination. Site quality indicates the ability of the site to 
support growth of the stand. Site quality is sometimes used as an indicator of 
productivity. 
3) For forecasting yields in the forest 
4) For making management decisions 
5) For determining the value of sites, growing stock and financial returns. 
We can identify three types of yield tables: 
1) Normal yield table 
52 
2) Imperial yield table 
3) Variable density yield table 
A normal yield table  
Shows the relationship between two independent variables and one or more 
dependent variables. The independent variables are age and site index while the 
dependent variables are CAI and MAI of tree mean diameter etc. The chief 
criterion for their construction is that the stand must be full (normal stocking). 
Normal stocking is the maximum number of trees which can be grown in a 
particular site, given an appropriate spacing. E.g., normal stocking of an 
espacement of 10m x 10m in 1 ha. 
Area = 1 ha or 10000 m2  
Spacing = 10 x 10 
Stocking = Area in m2 / Espacement = 10000/100 = 100 trees. 
Criteria for normality include close crown/canopy cover, no opening in the stand 
and regular spacing 
Imperial yield table 
IT is similar to the normal yield table but used data is usually from stands of 
average stocking rather than full stocking. 
Variable density yield tables 
Are usually prepared with the stand density as independent variable. Full stocking 
is not required. Sample plots of any density can be used. 
53 
The difference between a volume table and a yield table is that, the yield table 
indicates wood while the volume table is used in the estimation of timber in 
forests.  Also, yield table is based on area whereas the volume table is based on 
volume.

DEFINITION   Slides 10-11 
Desertification is the process of land degradation in arid, semi-arid 
and sub-humid areas due to various factors including climatic 
variations and human activities. Or, to put it in another way, 
desertification results in persistent degradation of dry land and 
fragile ecosystems due to man-made activities and variations in 
climate. Desertification, in short, is when land that was originally of 
another type of biome turns into a desert biome because of changes 
of all sorts. A huge issue that many countries have is the fact that 
there are large pockets of land that are going through a process that is 
known as desertification.

WHERE DOES DESERTIFICATION OCCUR?    Slide 13 
hYPER 
Hyper-arid regions: 
Rainfall is less than 100 mm/year. 
Drought periods can last longer than a year. Biological productivity is low and the sole 
viable activity is nomadic pastoralism. 
Arid regions: 
Generally rainfall does not exceed 200 mm/year. 
These regions are characterized by farming (sedentary or nomadic) and irrigated 
agriculture. 
Semi-arid regions: 
Rainfall does not exceed 500 mm/year in areas of winter rains or 800 mm/year in 
areas of summer rains. 
These regions are characterized by cattle-rearing and sedentary agriculture. 
Dry sub-humid regions: 
Rainfall cycles are highly seasonal. 
These regions are characterized by rain-fed agriculture. As with semi-arid regions, 
they are particularly vulnerable to the phenomenon of desertification due to pressure 
from the rising population.

CAUSES OF DESERTIFICATION   Slide 15 
Overgrazing: 
Animal grazing is a huge problem for many areas that are starting to become desert 
biomes. If there are too many animals that are overgrazing in certain spots, it makes 
it difficult for the plants to grow back, which hurts the biome and makes it lose its 
former green glory. 
Deforestation: 
When people are looking to move into an area, or they need trees in order to make 
houses and do other tasks, then they are contributing to the problems related to 
desertification. Without the plants (especially the trees) around, the rest of biome 
connot thrive 
Farming Practices: 
Some farmers do not know how to use the land effectively. They may essentially strip 
the land of everything that it has before moving on to another plot of land. By 
stripping the soil of its nutrients, desertification becomes more and more of a reality 
for the area that is being used for farming. 
Urbanization and other types of land development: 
Inevitably, development can cause people to go through and kill the plant life. It can 
also cause issues with the soil due to chemicals and other things that may harm the 
ground. As areas become more urbanized, there are less places for plants to grow, 
thus causing desertification. 
Climate Change: 
Climate change plays a huge role in desertification. As the days get warmer and 
periods of drought become more frequent, desertification becomes more and more 
eminent. Unless climate change is slowed down, huge areas of land will become 
desert; some of those areas may even become uninhabitable as time goes on. 
Stripping the Land of Resources: 
If an area of land has natural resources like natural gas, oil, or minerals, people will 
come in and mine it or take it out. This usually strips the soil of nutrients, which in 
turn kills the plant life, which in turn starts the process toward becoming a desert 
biome as time goes on. 
Natural Disasters: 
There are some cases where the land gets damaged because of natural disasters, 
including drought. In those cases, there isn’t a lot that people can do except work to 
try and help rehabilitate the land after it has already been damaged by nature.

EFFECTS OF DESERTIFICATION   Slides 16-17 
Farming becomes next to impossible. 
If an area becomes a desert, then it’s almost impossible to grow substantial crops there 
without special technologies. This can cost a lot of money to try and do, so many 
farmers will have to sell their land and leave the desert areas. 
Hunger. 
Without farms in these areas, the food that those farms produce will become much 
scarcer, and the people who live in those local areas will be a lot more likely to try and 
deal with hunger problems. Animals will also go hungry, which will cause even more of 
a food shortage. 
Flooding. 
Without the plant life in an area, flooding is a lot more eminent. Not all deserts are dry; 
those that are wet could experience a lot of flooding because there is nothing to stop 
the water from gathering and going all over the place. Flooding can also negatively 
affect the water supply, which we will discuss next. 
Poor Water Quality 
If an area becomes a desert, the water quality is going to become a lot worse than it 
would have been otherwise. This is because the plant life plays a significant role in 
keeping the water clean and clear; without its presence, it becomes a lot more difficult 
for you to be able to do that 
Overpopulation 
When areas start to become desert, animals and people will go to other areas where 
they can actually thrive. This causes crowding and overpopulation, which will, in the 
long run, end up continuing the cycle of desertification that started this whole thing 
anyway. 
Poverty 
All of the issues that we’ve talked about above (related to the problem of desertification) 
can lead to poverty if it is not kept in check. Without food and water, it becomes harder 
for people to thrive, and they take a lot of time to try and get the things that they need

SOLUTIONS TO DESERTIFICATION   Slides 19-20 
Policy change to responsible farming 
In countries where policy change will actually be enforced on those in the country, 
policy change related to how often people can farm and how much they can farm on 
certain areas could be put into place to help reduce the problems that are often 
associated with farming and desertification. 
Policy changes to respectful land use 
If people are using land to get natural resources or they are developing it for people to 
live on, then the policies that govern them should be ones that will help the land to 
thrive instead of allowing them to harm the land further. The policy changes could be 
sweeping or they could be depending on the type of land use at hand. 
Education 
In developing countries, education is an incredibly important tool that needs to be 
utilized in order to help people to understand the best way to use the land that they are 
farming on. By educating them on sustainable practices, more land will be saved from 
becoming desert. 
Technology Advances 
In some cases, it’s difficult to try and prevent desertification from happening. In those 
cases, there needs to be research and advancements in technology that push the limits 
of what we currently know. Advancements could help us find more ways to prevent the 
issue from becoming epidemic. 
Putting Together Rehabilitation Efforts 
There are some ways that we can go back and rehabilitate the land that we’ve already 
pushed into desertification; it just takes some investment of time and money. By putting 
these together, we can prevent the issue from becoming even more widespread in the 
areas that have already been affected. 
Sustainable practices to prevent desertification 
There are plenty of sustainable practices that can be applied to those acts that may be 
causing desertification. By adding these to what we should be doing with land, we can 
ensure that we don’t turn the entire world into a desert.

DEFINITION   Slides 9/11 
Deforestation in simple term means the felling and clearing of forest 
cover or tree plantations in order to accommodate agricultural, 
industrial or urban use. It involves permanent end of forest cover to 
make that land available for residential, commercial or industrial 
purpose. 
With the world growing at a pace hard to match, the increasing need 
for space is turning out to be an area of concern. With desperate need 
for land for agricultural, industrial and most importantly urban needs to 
contain cities and their growing population, a direct action that we 
have come to recognize as “Deforestation” occurs.

WHERE DOES DEFORASTATION OCCUR? Slides 12-13 
Amazon 
The world’s largest forest; The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining 
hYPER 
rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in 
the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.. 
Cattle ranching and agriculture are the dominant causes of deforestation in most of the 
region. 
Atlantic Forest/Gran Chaco 
Spanning across Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina, the area is one of the richest rain 
forests in the world, but also where 75 % of the Brazilian population lives, pressuring on 
the forests. Deforestation is mainly due to conversion of forest land to cropland and 
pasture. 
Borneo 
Projections for 2030 for the “Heart of Borneo” show only 33 % of the lowland rainforest 
remaining. Deforestation and degradation are driven by weak governance and a lack of 
stability that has also encouraged the creation of intensive palm oil plantations, so far. 
Cerrado 
Although not just as well-known as the Amazon, this forest is under just as threatened 
as well, mainly due to cattle ranching and the conversion of forests to soy plantations. If 
the current rate of loss continues, much of the Cerrado’s savannah, woodland and 
forests outside of protected areas will disappear by 2030. 
Choco-Darien 
It is an ecoregion in the west of Colombia and east of Panama. The region has 
extremely high rainfall, and the forests hold great biodiversity. The northern and 
southern parts of the ecoregion have been considerably modified for ranching and 
farming, and there are threats from logging for paper pulp, uncontrolled gold mining, 
coca growing and industrialisation, but the central part of the ecoregion is relatively 
intact. 
Congo Basin 
One of the most important wilderness areas on Earth, this region contains 20 percent of 
the world’s tropical forests and the highest biological diversity in Africa. The human 
population here is expected to double between 2000 and 2030, mainly in urban areas. 
Forests close to large cities are particularly threatened. 
NOTES/TIPS/ACTIVITIES 
As the students virtually hover 
above the Earth, the teacher 
explains the main differences 
between the different forests 
around the planet, focusing on 
their peculiarity, they richness in 
terms of biodiversity and their 
fragility in terms of lack of 
protective policies, needs of land 
for agriculture, illegal activities  
www.globalforestwatch.org 
http://earth.tryse.net/ 
14 
Eastern Africa 
Much of this region’s forests are overharvested (for timber and fuelwood), 
illegally logged or converted for livestock and cash crops. Deforestation cuts 
through the region’s miombo (Brachystegia) woodlands, coastal forests and 
mountain forests. The coastal forests of Tanzania and Kenya have already 
been reduced to 10 % of their original area. 
Eastern Australia 
Despite a recent reduction in forest loss, a projected weakening of key 
legislation in the frontline states of Queensland and New South Wales 
threatens a resurgence in deforestation, mainly to create pasture for 
livestock. Key species affected include koalas, possums, gliders and tree
dependent birds. 
Greater Mekong 
The economy here is booming bringing about an urgent need to balance 
conservation with economic development, i.e. the need to convert forest 
land to sugar, rice, rubber and biofuels plantations. The more the land is 
converted, the more the species are threatened. 126 new species were 
discovered here in 2011, including fish, snakes, frogs and bats. 
New Guinea 
New Guinea and its neighboring islands are home to the largest remaining 
tracts of tropical forest in the Asia-Pacific region. Yet threatened by need of 
land for agriculture. The rate of deforestation could surge if current 
proposals for agricultural development were approved. 
Sumatra 
Sumatra, especially Riau province, has become the center of Indonesia’s 
palm oil production, even in protected forests and national parks. The status 
of plans by some governments to stabilize and even reverse forest loss 
remains unclear, leaving tigers, orangutans, rhinos and other wildlife at risk 
(https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/11-of-the-world-s-most-threatened
forests) 
15 
CAUSES OF DEFORASTATION   Slides 14-15 
Agricultural Activities 
As earlier mentioned in the overview, agricultural activities are one of the major factors 
affecting deforestation. Due to overgrowing demand for food products, huge amount of 
tress are fell down to grow crops and for cattle grazing. 
Logging 
Apart from this, wood based industries like paper, match-sticks, furniture etc. also need 
a substantial amount of wood supply. Wood is used as fuel both directly and indirectly, 
therefore trees are chopped for supplies. Firewood and charcoal are examples of wood 
being used as fuel. Some of these industries thrive on illegal wood cutting and felling of 
trees. 
Urbanization 
Further on order to gain access to these forests, the construction of roads are 
undertaken; here again trees are chopped to create roads. Overpopulation too directly 
affects forest covers, as with the expansion of cities more land is needed to establish 
housing and settlements. Therefore forest land is reclaimed. 
Desertification of land 
Some of the other factors that lead to deforestation are also part natural and part 
anthropogenic like Desertification of land. It occurs due to land abuse making it unfit for 
growth of trees. Many industries in petrochemicals release their waste into rivers 
which results in soil erosion and make it unfit to grow plants and trees. 
Mining 
Oil and coal mining require considerable amount of forest land. Apart from this, roads 
and highways have to be built to make way for trucks and other equipment. The waste 
that comes out from mining pollutes the environment and affects the nearby species. 
Forest Fires 
Another example would be forest blazes; Hundreds of trees are lost each year due to 
forest fires in various portions of the world. This happens due to extreme warm 
summers and milder winters. Fires, whether causes by man or nature results in huge 
loss of forest cover.

EFFECTS OF DEFORASTATION   Slides 16-17 
Climate Imbalance 
Deforestation also affects the climate in more than one ways. Trees release water 
vapor in the air, which is compromised on with the lack of trees. Trees also provide the 
required shade that keeps the soil moist. This leads to the imbalance in the atmospheric 
temperature further making conditions for the ecology difficult. Flora and fauna across 
the world are accustomed to their habitat. This haphazard clearance of forests have 
forced several of these animals to shift from their native environment. Due to this 
several species are finding it difficult to survive or adapt to new habitats. 
Increase in Global Warming 
Trees play a major role in controlling global warming. The trees utilize the greenhouse 
gases, restoring the balance in the atmosphere. With constant deforestation the ratio of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased, adding to our global warming 
woes. 
Soil Erosion 
Also due to the shade of trees the soil remains moist. With the clearance of tree cover, 
the soil is directly exposed to the sun, making it dry. 
Floods 
When it rains, trees absorb and store large amount of water with the help of their roots. 
When they are cut down, the flow of water is disrupted and leads to floods in some 
areas and droughts in other. 
Wildlife Extinction 
Due to massive felling down of trees, various species of animals are lost. They lose 
their habitat and forced to move to new location. Some of them are even pushed to 
extinction. Our world has lost so many species of plants and animals in last couple of 
decades.

SOLUTIONS TO DEFORESTATION   Slides 18-19 
Policy Change and regulation on different types of land use 
Due to the nature and extent of forest destruction, efforts to regulate human activities 
can be complemented by laws and regulation at governmental and organizational 
levels. Timber and other valuable resources can no longer be considered as immediate 
economic gains at the expenses of long-term environmental damage: preserving the 
natural vegetation demands rules, laws, and regulations from organizations and 
governments to aid in enforcing forest preservation policies. 
Clear cutting of forests must be banned 
Land stripping of its tree cover for urban settlements should be urged to plant a 
satisfying number of new trees in the vicinity: although trees are being planted under 
several initiatives every year, they still don’t match the numbers of the ones already 
been lost, so far. 
Replanting 
Reforestation is the restoration of forests that have been reduced by fire or felling. It 
requires ongoing processes and should not be viewed as a spot solution. It involves 
selecting and dedicating large tracts of land mainly for the purpose of cultivating forests. 
Replanting, therefore, qualifies restorative measure of deforestation. 
Sensitization and Educative Campaign 
Sensitization campaigns can be as simple as effective. Education can be used to 
emphasize the negative effects of deforestation, thus making communities aware of the 
need to stand up to combat indiscriminate clearing of forests. 
Green business concerns re-use and recycling 
Re-using and re-cycle based economies would definitely decrease the dependence on 
natural resources and trees, thus reducing both needs and imports of raw-materials 
from forest regions.

NOTES/TIPS/ACTIVITIES 
etymology 
Students search for the meaning 
of the two words that make up 
the term biodiversity 
Biodiversity or Biological diversity is a term that describes the variety 
of living beings on earth. In short, it is described as degree of variation 
of life. Biological diversity encompasses microorganism, plants, 
animals and ecosystems such as coral reefs, forests, rainforests, 
deserts etc. Biodiversity also refers to the number, or abundance of 
different species living within a particular region. It represents the 
wealth of biological resources available to us. It’s all about the 
sustaining the natural area made up of community of plants, animals, 
and other living things that is begin reduced at a steady rate as we 
plan human activities that is being reduced by habitat destruction. 
 
Biodiversity has three essential elements: 
 
 Genetic diversity, 
 Eco system diversity 
 Species diversity 
  
Recently a new aspect has also been added- ‘molecular diversity’. 
Biodiversity is unevenly distributed. It varies globally and within 
regions. The various factors that influence biodiversity include 
temperature, altitude, precipitation, soils and their relation with other 
species. For instance, ocean biodiversity is 25 times lesser than 
terrestrial diversity. Biodiversity also increases its form as it moves 
from the poles towards the tropics. Biodiversity is the result of 3.5 
billion years of evolution. It has been subject to periods of extinction. 
The latest and most destructive stage of extinction is Holocene 
extinction, which has occurred due to the impact of human beings on 
the environment.

WHY IS BIODIVERSITY IMPORTANT?  Slides 11-12  
Biological diversity is the resource upon which families, communities, nations and future 
generations depend. It is the link between all organisms on earth, binding each into an 
interdependant ecosystem, in which all species play their role. It is the web of life. 
The Earth’s natural assets are made up of plants, animals, land, water, the atmosphere 
AND humans! Together we all form part of the planet’s ecosystems, which means if 
there is a biodiversity crisis, our health and livelihoods are at risk too. 
Biodiversity has a number of functions on the Earth. These are as follows: 
 
 
 
Maintaining balance of the ecosystem: Recycling and storage of nutrients, 
combating pollution, and stabilizing climate, protecting water resources, 
forming and protecting soil and maintaining Eco balance. 
Provision of biological resources: Provision of medicines and 
pharmaceuticals, food for the human population and animals, ornamental 
plants, wood products, breeding stock and diversity of species, ecosystems 
and genes. 
Social benefits: Recreation and tourism, cultural value and education and 
research. 
EFFECTS OF DESERTIFICATION 
NOTES/TIPS/ACTIVITIES

loss in terms of numbers, i.e. the 
number of spices gone extinct, 
or at risk or extinction, for each 
class of animals (reptiles, 
mammals …) and plants

23 
The role of biodiversity in the following areas will help make clear the importance of 
biodiversity in human life: 
 
 
 
 
Biodiversity and food: 80% of human food supply comes from 20 kinds of 
plants. But humans use 40,000 species for food, clothing and shelter. 
Biodiversity provides for variety of foods for the planet. 
Biodiversity and human health: The shortage of drinking water is 
expected to create a major global crisis. Biodiversity also plays an important 
role in drug discovery and medicinal resources. Medicines from nature 
account for usage by 80% of the world’s population. 
Biodiversity and industry: Biological sources provide many industrial 
materials. These include fiber, oil, dyes, rubber, water, timber, paper and 
food. 
Biodiversity and culture: Biodiversity enhances recreational activities like 
bird watching, fishing, trekking etc. It inspires musicians and artists.

NOTES/TIPS/ACTIVITIES 
Among others, students shall 
relate biodiversity loss to 
desertification and deforestation 
The earth’s biodiversity is in grave danger. In the present era, human beings are the 
most dangerous cause of destruction of the earth’s biodiversity. In 2006, the terms 
threatened, endangered or rare were used to describe the status of many species. 
The “evil quartet” identified by Jared Diamond is overkill, habitat destruction, 
secondary extinctions and introduced species. Factors identified by Edward Wilson 
are described by the acronym- HIPPO standing for: 
 
  habitat destruction 
  climate change / global warming 
  deforastation 
  invasive species  
  pollution 
  human overpopulation  
  Over-harvesting. 
 
Species which are physically large and those living in forests or oceans are more 
affected by habitat reduction. Some expert’s estimate that around 30% of all species 
on earth will be extinct by 2050. According to the International Union for Conservation 
of Nature (IUCN), globally about one third of all known species are threatened with 
extinction. Even it is estimated that 25% of all mammals will be extinct within 20 
years. Even if a small element of an ecosystem breaks down, the whole system’s 
balance is threatened. Fresh water ecosystems are nowadays the most threatened 
ecosystems. Invasive species refer to those that would normally remain constrained 
from an ecosystem because of the presence of natural barriers. Since these barriers 
are no longer existing, invasive species invade the ecosystem, destroying native 
species. Species can also be threatened by genetic pollution- uncontrolled 
hybridization and gene swamping. For instance, abundant species can interbreed 
with rare species thus causing swamping of the gene pool. Over exploitation is 
caused by activities such as over fishing, over hunting, excessive logging and illegal 
trade of wildlife. Over 25% of global fisheries are being overfished at unsustainable 
levels. 
Global warming is also becoming a major cause for loss of biodiversity. For example 
if the present rate of global warming continues, coral reefs which are biodiversity 
hotspots will disappear in 20-40 years. 10% of all species might become extinct by 
2015, if global warming continues. Thus we can see that biodiversity which is crucial 
for the wellbeing of life on earth, is coming under the threat of many factors related to 
human activities. There is an urgent need to take action to protect the magnificent 
biodiversity of our planet. We must create economic policies in order to maintain the 
Earth’s biodiversity and take appropriate measures to protect habitats and species.

NOTES/TIPS/ACTIVITIES 
Teacher moderates students 
debate on listed effects 
 
Class debate 
Habitat destruction 
Habitat destruction is the leading cause of extinction for various species and is the 
reason that many animals are endangered. Animals are very intelligent beings, but 
without their natural homes, they are unable to protect themselves and care for their 
young. 
 
Land level 
When we make way for homes and buildings, the land has to be level in order for the 
building to be stable and for the construction process to begin. When bulldozers go 
through woodlands to clear trees and flatten the ground, this is usually why. For 
animals, this process happens so suddenly that there is no time to adapt to such drastic 
changes. 
 
Natural shelter 
Animals store food and water for times of inclement weather or when their food source is 
no longer in season. During bad weather, natural shelters are very similar to human 
homes, serving as protection from storms, heavy rain, or extreme temperatures. As 
wildlife is displaced, it changes their entire way of living. Many species use their homes 
as a place to find solace from predators. Also, young animals need to be cared for in 
various ways in the wild. They have to be protected from predators that can attack them 
while they are defenseless, and they must learn to hunt and gather their own food. 
 
Natural unbalance 
Ecosystems are nature’s way of creating balance between different species and the 
environment. Life in the wild is instinctual with everything being interconnected. 
Everything from blades of grass to the tallest trees serve a purpose. Animals thrive off of 
the land and also from one another. When we disturb this balance, they are often left 
confused and lost, finding themselves in harm’s way. The ultimate result of this is death 
and the inability to reproduce offspring that carries on the species. 
 
Quality of soil 
We must also consider what happens to the ground. Many plants can no longer grow 
because the composition and soil quality is instantly changed, taking away the nutrients 
and the space that plants need to grow. The land itself is also packed down so tightly 
from human equipment that many plants cannot force themselves to grow and if the 
seeds are not sown elsewhere, the plant type could be completely lost within the region. 
 
Toxic chemical ingredients 
With large amounts of land used for industrial farming, runoff is another issue that 
contributes to the pollution that leads to habitat degradation. Farming often requires 
large amounts of fertilizers, pesticides, and other materials that are full of chemicals and 
harmful ingredients. These substances used to protect crops and promote their growth. 
Ultimately, the toxic ingredients absorb into the ground and flow into lakes, rivers and 
oceans, poisoning the water and animals. 
 
Underwater systems 
Underwater systems are disrupted by siphoning water and changing the way it flows in 
order to meet the human needs for drinking water and irrigation for crops. This effect 
brings about the creation of new dry areas, thus damaging to the underwater habitats 
and species. 
 
Global warming 
As humans destroy natural habitats, we are contributing to global warming and climate 
change. The more trees that are cut down, the more carbon dioxide that goes into the air 
and causes the Earth to heat up more quickly. This change in temperature is killing 
various species, especially in regions where the changes are extreme. Consequently, 
temperatures are becoming more unpleasant for us as time goes on and additional 
greenhouse gases fill the air 
(https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/causes-effects-solutions-for-habitat-loss-and
destruction.php) 
 
 
 
SOLUTION TO BIODIVERSITY LOSS   Slides 19-20 
Combat habitat loss 
We can combat habitat loss by preserving natural resources and learning how to use 
them in a way that does not require such frequent destruction of habitats. Regulation is 
equally important. Plans and rules should be set forth to legalize how much of a given 
area can be altered for the benefits of humans. By practicing more restraint, we allow 
wildlife time to adapt and leave more areas undisturbed for the sake of biodiversity. 
Education 
We should also teach others the importance of biodiversity. Comprehensive education 
regarding the environment helps people to understand how necessary biodiversity is 
and teaches ways in which everyone can contribute to causes that aid in keeping many 
different species alive. 
Awareness 
Along with education, awareness should also be raised. Observers should make it a 
point to assist reporting professionals by safely documenting the process of habitat 
destruction whenever the opportunity arises. Videos and photos help to visually present 
the unfortunate circumstances that environmental destruction can create, evoking 
emotional responses that will inspire others to take action to protect natural habitats. 
Destroy but rebuilt 
As quickly as humans can destroy natural habitats, we should be just as willing to put 
forth the effort to rebuild and attempt to replace what is lost. For areas that cannot be 
saved, we can assist in funding the creation of areas that will serve as a refuge for 
displaced wildlife instead. These safe havens mimic the natural habitats that allow 
plants to grow and animals to live healthily without the threat of devastation. Efforts 
have been put in place to create these sanctuaries by environmentalists all over the 
world to protect species from extinction.

apply to any territory worldwide; nevertheless, in some countries 
around the world, they might not be crucial due to both the physical 
characteristic of the location and land use patterns in the area, in 
terms of soil, climate, human activities and political action. In other 
words, some territories are more exposed to the risk of biodiversity 
loss than others.

DEFINITION   Slides 9-11 
Many people do conceive the idea of soil degradation but a good number lacks the 
knowledge of its precise definition. To fill this knowledge gap, soil degradation simply 
means the decline in soil quality which comes about due to aspects such as improper 
land use, agriculture, and pasture, urban or industrial purposes. It involves the decline 
of the soil’s physical, biological and chemical state. 
Soil degradation examples include decline in soil fertility, adverse changes in alkalinity, 
acidity or salinity, extreme flooding, use of toxic soil pollutants, erosion, and 
deterioration of the soil’s structural condition. These elements contribute to a significant 
amount of soil quality depreciation annually. Excessive soil degradation thus gives rise 
to immediate and long-term impacts which translate into serious global environmental 
headaches. While soil degradation may occur naturally, it has been highly exuberated 
by anthropogenic activities. Besides, climate change combined with human activities 
continues to worsen soil degradation. With the objective of understanding the distinct 
nature of soil quality decline, here are the causes, effects, and solutions of soil 
degradation.

WHERE LAND DEGRADATION IS MOST SUFFERED?   Slides 12-13 
hYPER 
The productivity of some lands has declined by 50% due to soil erosion and 
desertification. Yield reduction in Africa due to past soil erosion may range from 2 to 
40%, with a mean loss of 8.2% for the continent. In South Asia, annual loss in 
productivity is estimated at 36 million tons of cereal  by water erosion, and due to wind 
erosion. It is estimated that the total annual cost of erosion from agriculture in the USA 
is about US$44 billion per year, i.e. about US$247 per ha of cropland and pasture. On 
a global scale the annual loss of 75 billion tons of soil costs the world about US$400 
billion per year. Only about 3% of the global land surface can be considered as prime 
or Class I land and this is not found in the tropics. Another 8% of land is in Classes II 
and III. This 11% of land must feed the six billion people today and the 7.6 billion 
expected in 2020. Desertification is experienced on 33% of the global land surface and 
affects more than one billion people, half of whom live in Africa. 
Information on the economic impact of land degradation by different processes on a 
global scale is not available. Some information for local and regional scales is available 
and has been reviewed by Lal (1998). In Canada, for example, on-farm effects of land 
degradation were estimated to range from US$700 to US$915 million in 1984 (Girt, 
1986). The economic impact of land degradation is extremely severe in densely 
populated South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. 
On plot and field scales, erosion can cause yield reductions of 30 to 90% in some root
restrictive shallow lands of West Africa (Mbagwu et al.,1984; Lal, 1987). Yield 
reductions of 20 to 40% have been measured for row crops in Ohio (Fahnestock et al., 
1995) and elsewhere in Midwest USA (Schumacher et al., 1994). In the Andean region 
of Colombia, workers from the University of Hohenheim, Germany (Ruppenthal, 1995), 
have observed severe losses due to accelerated erosion on some lands. Few attempts 
have been made to assess the global economic impact of erosion. The productivity of 
some lands in Africa (Dregne, 1990) has declined by 50% as a result of soil erosion 
and desertification. Yield reduction in Africa (Lal, 1995) due to past soil erosion may 
range from 2 to 40%, with a mean loss of 8.2% for the continent. If accelerated erosion 
continues unabated, yield reductions by 2020 may be 16.5%. Annual reduction in total 
production for 1989 due to accelerated erosion was 8.2 million tons for cereals, 9.2 
million tons for roots and tubers, and 0.6 million tons for pulses.  
NOTES/TIPS/ACTIVITIES 
Although not the only degraded areas, 
urban areas are no doubt degraded 
areas in terms of land degradation. Are 
there any others? 
33 
There are also serious (20%) productivity losses caused by erosion in Asia, especially in 
India, China, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Nepal, and Pakistan (Dregne, 1992). In South 
Asia, annual loss in productivity is estimated at 36 million tons of cereal equivalent valued 
at US$5,400 million by water erosion, and US$1,800 million due to wind erosion (UNEP, 
1994). t is estimated that the total annual cost of erosion from agriculture in the USA is 
about US$44 billion per year, about US$247 per ha of cropland and pasture. On a global 
scale the annual loss of 75 billion tons of soil costs (at US$3 per ton of soil for nutrients 
and US$2 per ton of soil, for water) the world about US$400 billion per year, or 
approximately US$70 per person per year (Lal, 1998). Soil compaction is a worldwide 
problem, especially with the adoption of mechanized agriculture. It has caused yield 
reductions of 25 to 50% in some regions of Europe (Ericksson et al., 1974) and North 
America, and between 40 and 90% in West African countries (Charreau, 1972; Kayombo 
and Lal, 1994). In Ohio, reductions in crop yields are 25% in maize, 20% in soybeans, and 
30% in oats over a seven-year period (Lal, 1996). On-farm losses through land 
compaction in the USA have been estimated at US$1.2 billion per year (Gill, 1971). 
Nutrient depletion as a form of land degradation has a severe economic impact at the 
global scale, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Stoorvogel et al. (1993) have estimated 
nutrient balances for 38 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Annual depletion rates of soil 
fertility were estimated at 22 kg N, 3 kg P, and 15 kg K ha-1. In Zimbabwe, soil erosion 
results in an annual loss of N and P alone totaling US$1.5 billion. In South Asia, the 
annual economic loss is estimated at US$600 million for nutrient loss by erosion, and 
US$1,200 million due to soil fertility depletion (Stocking, 1986; UNEP, 1994). 
An estimated 950 million ha of salt-affected lands occur in arid and semi-arid regions, 
nearly 33% of the potentially arable land area of the world. Productivity of irrigated lands is 
severely threatened by build up of salt in the root zone. In South Asia, annual economic 
loss is estimated at US$500 million from waterlogging, and US$1,500 million due to 
salinization (UNEP, 1994)

34 
CAUSES OF LAND DEGRADATION   Slides 14-15 
Physical Factors 
There are several physical factors contributing to soil degradation distinguished by the 
manners in which they change the natural composition and structure of the soil. 
Rainfall, surface runoff, floods, wind erosion, tillage, and mass movements result in the 
loss of fertile top spoil thereby declining soil quality. All these physical factors produces 
different types of soil erosion (mainly water and wind erosion) and soil detachment 
actions, and their resultant physical forces eventually changes the composition and 
structure of the soil by wearing away the soil’s top layer as well as organic matter. In the 
long-term, the physical forces and weathering processes lead to the decline in soil 
fertility and adverse changes in the soil’s composition/structure. 
Biological Factors 
Biological factors refer to the human and plant activities that tend to reduce the quality 
of soil. Some bacteria and fungi overgrowth in an area can highly impact the microbial 
activity of the soil through bio-chemical reactions, which reduces crop yield and the 
suitability of soil productivity capacity. Human activities such as poor farming practices 
may also deplete soil nutrients thus diminishing soil fertility. The biological factors affect 
mainly lessens the microbial activity of the soil. 
Chemical Factors  
The reduction of soil nutrients because of alkalinity or acidity or water logging are all 
categorized under the chemical components of soil degradation. In the broadest sense, 
it 
comprises alterations in the soil’s chemical property that determine nutrient 
availability. It is mainly caused by salt buildup and leaching of nutrients which corrupt 
the quality of soil by creating undesirable changes in the essential soil chemical 
ingredients. These chemical factors normally bring forth irreversible loss of soil nutrients 
and productivity capacity such as the hardening of iron and aluminum rich clay soils into 
hardpans. 
NOTES/TIPS/ACTIVITIES 
There are many types of 
degradation of the land at 
different levels, so far; they all 
share the same causes.  
The class goes over the many 
causes that bring about 
desertification, 
then 
the 
teacher invites the students to 
group and surf the internet to 
look for pictures, images, 
videos and any sort of digital 
info 
and/or 
evidence of 
whatever may or might have 
caused any deforestation. 
SUGGESTIONS 
Students group up and work 
on a personal project aimed at 
testing 
the new acquired 
knowledge. 
35 
Deforestation 
Deforestation causes soil degradation on the account of exposing soil minerals by removing 
trees and crop cover, which support the availability of humus and litter layers on the surface of 
the soil. Vegetation cover primarily promotes thee binding of the soil together and soil formation, 
hence when it is removed it considerably affects the capabilities of the soil such as aeration, 
water holding capacity, and biological activity. When trees are removed by logging, infiltration 
rates become elevated and the soil remains bare and exposed to erosion and the buildup of 
toxicities. Some of the contributing activities include logging and slash and burn techniques used 
by individuals who invade forest areas for farming, rendering the soils unproductive and less 
fertile in the end. 
Misuse or excess use of fertilizers 
The excessive use and the misuse of pesticides and chemical fertilizers kill organisms that assist 
in binding the soil together. Most agricultural practices involving the use of fertilizers and 
pesticides often entail misuse or excessive application, thereby contributing to the killing of soil’s 
beneficial bacteria and other micro-organisms that help in soil formation. The complex forms of 
the fertilizer’s chemicals are also responsible for denaturing essential soil minerals, giving rise to 
nutrient losses from the soil. Therefore, the misuse or excessive use of fertilizers increases the 
rate of soil degradation by destroying the soil’s biological activity and builds up of toxicities 
through incorrect fertilizer use. 
Industrial and Mining activities 
Soil is chiefly polluted by industrial and mining activities. As an example, mining destroys crop 
cover and releases a myriad of toxic chemicals such as mercury into the soil thereby poisoning it 
and rendering it unproductive for any other purpose. Industrial activities, on the other hand, 
release toxic effluents and material wastes into the atmosphere, land, rivers, and ground water 
that eventually pollute the soil and as such, it impacts on soil quality. Altogether, industrial and 
mining activities degrade the soil’s physical, chemical and biological properties. 
Improper cultivation practices 
There are certain agricultural practices that are environmentally unsustainable and at the same 
time, they are the single biggest contributor to the worldwide increase in soil quality decline. The 
tillage on agricultural lands is one of the main factors since it breaks up soil into finer particles, 
which increase erosion rates. The soil quality decline is exuberated more and more as a result of 
the mechanization of agriculture that gives room for deep plowing, reduction of plant cover, and 
the formation of the hardpan. Other improper cultivation activities such as farming on steep slope 
and mono-cropping, row-cropping and surface irrigation wear away the natural composition of 
the soil and its fertility, and prevent soil from regenerating. 
Urbanization 
Urbanization has major implications on the soil degradation process. Foremost of all, it 
denudates the soil’s vegetation cover, compacts soil during construction, and alters the drainage 
pattern. Secondly, it covers the soil in an impermeable layer of concrete that amplifies the 
amount of surface runoff which results in more erosion of the top soil. Again, most of the runoff 
and sediments from urban areas are extremely polluted with oil, fuel, and other chemicals. 
Increased runoff from urban areas also causes a huge disturbance to adjacent water sheds by 
changing the rate and volume of water that flow s through them, and impoverishing them with 
chemically polluted sediment deposits. 
Overgrazing 
The rates of soil erosion and the loss of soil nutrients as well as the top soil are highly 
contributed by overgrazing. Overgrazing destroys surface crop cover and breaks down soil 
particles, increasing the rates of soil erosion. As a result, soil quality and agricultural productivity 
is greatly affected.

EFFECTS OF LAND DEGRADATION  Slides 16-17  
Land degradation 
Soil quality decline is one of the main causes of land degradation and is considered 
to be responsible for 84% of the ever diminishing acreage. Year after year, huge 
acres of land lost due to soil erosion, contamination and pollution. About 40% of the 
world’s agricultural land is severely diminished in quality because of erosion and the 
use of chemical fertilizers, which prevent land from regenerating. The decline in soil 
quality as a result of agricultural chemical fertilizers also further leads to water and 
land pollution there by lowering the land’s worth on earth 
Drought and aridity 
Drought and aridity are problems highly influenced and amplified by soil degradation. 
As much as it’s a concern associated with natural environments in arid and semi-arid 
areas, the UN recognizes the fact that drought and aridity are anthropogenic induced 
factors especially as an outcome of soil degradation. Hence, the contributing factors 
to soil quality decline such as overgrazing, poor tillage methods, and deforestation 
are also the leading causes of desertification characterized by droughts and arid 
conditions. On the same context, soil degradation may also bring about loss of 
biodiversity. 
Loss of arable land 
Because soil degradation contributes to land degradation, it also means that it 
creates a significant loss of arable land. As stated earlier, about 40% of the world’s 
agricultural land is lost on the account of soil quality depreciation caused by agro
chemicals and soil erosion. Most of the crop production practices result in the topsoil 
loss and the damage of soil’s natural composition that make agriculture possible. 
Increased flooding 
Land is commonly altered from its natural landscape when it rids its physical 
composition from soil degradation.  For this reason, the transformed land is unable to 
soak up water, making flooding more frequent. In other words, soil degradation takes 
away the soil’s natural capability of holding water thus contributing to more and more 
cases of flooding. 
Pollution and clogging of waterways 
Most of the soil eroded from the land together with the chemical fertilizers and 
pesticides utilized in agricultural fields are discharged into waterways and streams. 
With time, the sedimentation process can clog waterways, resulting in water scarcity. 
The agricultural fertilizers and pesticides also damage marine and freshwater 
ecosystem sand the limits the domestic uses of the water for the populations that 
depend on them for survival.

SOLUTIONS TO LAND DEGRADATION   Slides 18-19 
Reducing deforestation 
Avoiding deforestation completely is an uphill task. However, deforestation can be cut 
down and this can create an impressive way of reshaping and restoring forests and 
vegetation cover. As populations grow, individuals can be sensitized and educated 
regarding sustainable forest management and reforestation efforts. Also, preserving 
the integrity of guarded areas can significantly reduce demonstration. Hence, there is 
a necessity for individuals all over the world to respect forest cover and reduce some 
of the human-driven actions that encourage logging. With the reduction of 
deforestation, soil’s ability to naturally regenerate can be restored. Governments, 
international organizations, and other environmental stakeholders need to ensure 
there are appropriate measures for making zero net deforestation a reality so as to 
inhibit soil degradation. 
Land reclamation 
The outcomes of soil erosion and quality decline are widely irreversible. Still, soil 
organic matter and plant nutrients can be replenished. To restore the lost soil mineral 
matter and organic content, it would require what is known as land reclamation. Land 
reclamation encompasses activities centered towards restoring the previous organic 
matter and soil’s vital minerals. This may include activities such as the addition of 
plant residues to degraded soils and improving range management. Salinized soils 
can be restored by salt level correction reclamation projects and salinity control. One 
of the simplest but most forgotten methods of land reclamation is planting of 
vegetation such as trees, crops, and flowers over the affected soils. Plants act as 
protective covers as they are helpful at making the soil stronger by stabilizing the land 
surface. 
Preventing salinization 
Just like the old adage states that “prevention is better than cure,” so does the same 
concept apply in solving the worldwide problem of soil degradation through 
salinization. The costs of preventing salinization are incredibly cheaper than the 
reclamation projects in salinized areas. Consequently, actions such as reducing 
irrigation, planting salt tolerant crops, and improving irrigation efficiency will have high 
pay offs because the inputs and the labor-demanding aspects associated with 
reclamation projects are zero. Preventing salanization in the first place is thus 
an environmentally friendly means of offering solution to soil degradation. 
Conservation tillage 
Proper tillage mechanisms hold as one of the most sustainable ways of avoiding soil 
quality decline. This is otherwise known as conservation tillage, which means tillage 
mechanisms targeted at making very minimal changes to the soil’s natural condition 
and at the same time improving the soil’s productivity. Examples include leaving the 
previous year’s crop residue on the surface to shield the soil from erosion and 
avoiding poor tillage methods such as deep plowing.

CHEMICAL CONTROL - PESTICIDES 
1 Introduction 
Chemical control means the use of chemicals (pesticides) to control diseases, pests or weeds. 
Chemical control is based on substances that are toxic (poisonous) to the pests involved. When 
chemical pesticides are applied to protect plants from pests, diseases or overgrowth by weeds, we 
speak of plant protection products. 
2 Pesticide 
A pesticide is designed to kill, control, repel, attract, or manage pests. Any product that claims to 
do any of these things is a pesticide under the Pest Control Product Act and Regulations. Pesticides 
include chemicals that regulate plant growth, defoliants, or plant desiccants. 
Pesticides are used in agriculture to control weeds, insect infestation and diseases. There are many 
different types of pesticides; each is meant to be effective against specific pests. 
Name the different types of pesticides: e.g insecticide … 
3 Chemical control vs others 
Chemical control is often the first way to go by almost all farmers. Why? 
2 
4 Components of a Pesticide Formulation 
The mixture of active and inert ingredients is called a pesticide formulation. This formulation may 
consist of: The pesticide active ingredient that controls the target pest. The carrier, such as an 
organic solvent or mineral clay. The pesticide manufacturer develops the formulation 
to make it  
• safe,  
• convenient, and  
• effective.  
This formulation may consist of: 
• The pesticide active ingredient that controls the target pest 
• The carrier, such as an organic solvent or mineral clay, charcoal 
• Adjuvants, such as stickers and spreaders 
3 
• Other ingredients, such as stabilizers, safeners, dyes, and chemicals that improve or 
enhance pesticidal activity 
A formulation is one or more active ingredients combined with one or more formulants (inerts or 
non-active materials). A formulation is one or more active ingredients combined with formulants 
to make an effective product. 
4.1 Active Ingredient 
The active ingredient is the part of the formulation that gives the desired or toxic 
effect. A pesticide can have more than one active ingredient. 
4.2 Formulant 
A formulant is an inert (non-active) substance added by the manufacturer to the 
active ingredient. This allows it to be stored, handled, or applied. A formulant can 
be liquid or solid. 
4.3 Carrier 
A carrier is mixed with an active ingredient to make the pesticide: 
�
� Safer to handle 
�
� Easier to apply 
�
� Better suited for storage 
4 
Carriers include water, oil, solvents, or clay. Some pesticides do not need a carrier. Usually, you 
need to mix a formulated product with water or oil for final application. Most baits, granules, gels, 
and dusts, however, are ready for use without additional dilution. Manufacturers package many 
specialized pesticides, such as products for households, in ready-to-use formulations 
These are called Ready-to-Use (RTU) formulations. 
4.4 Adjuvant 
The manufacturer can add an adjuvant to the formulation. An adjuvant can also be 
added to the spray tank by the applicator. Adjuvants change application traits to 
make products: 
�
� Safer 
�
� More effective 
5 
�
� Easier to handle 
�
� Easier to apply 
Adjuvants increase the effectiveness of a pesticide by changing a physical or chemical trait. These 
broaden the conditions under which a pesticide can be used.

5.3 Gas formulations are fumigants.  
These can be purchased as solids, liquids, or gases. Fumigants are available as gases, liquids, and 
solids. Carbon dioxide and ethylene oxide are compressed gases used as fumigants. Liquid 
fumigants become gases when applied. Solid fumigants come as dust, pellets, or tablets that release 
gases when exposed to moist air.

CHEMICAL CONTROL – PESTICIDE GROUPINGS 
8.1 Grouping Pesticides 
There are many pesticides available. They can be grouped in a number of ways. The most common 
groupings are based on: 
✓ Target pests 
✓ The way the pesticide works (mode of action) 
✓ Their mode of entry  
✓ Chemical family 
8.1 Grouping based on Target pest 
The most common way to group pesticides is by the pest(s) they are registered to control. 
Common pesticide types and the groups of pests they are designed to control are given below 

8.2 Grouping based on mode of entry 
a)         
Stomach poison: The insecticide applied in the leaves and other parts of the plant when 
ingested, act in the digestive system of the insect and bring about kill (eg.) Malathion.  
b)        
Contact Poison: The toxicant which brings about death of the pest species by means of 
contact (eg.) Fenvalerate. Contact pesticides control pests when they come in direct contact with 
the pest. Weeds are killed when enough of their surface area is covered with a contact herbicide 
e.g Paraquat. Insects are controlled when sprayed directly, or when insects travel across treated 
surfaces. 
c)         
Fumigant: Toxicant enter in vapour form into the tracheal system (respiratory poison) 
through spiracles (eg.) Aluminium phosphide  
d)        
Systemic poison: Chemicals when applied to plant or soil are absorbed by foliage (or) roots 
and translocated through vascular system and cause death of insect feeding on plant. (eg.) 
Dimethoate. Systemic pesticides control pests when applied to one area of a plant or animal. The 
pesticide eventually moves throughout the entire plant or animal.  
Systemic herbicide absorbed through a plant’s roots and leaves moves throughout the whole plant 
and kills it e.g glyphosate 
Systemic insecticides enter plants through the roots or plant surfaces. These move throughout the 
plant and kill insects that feed on plant juices. A systemic insecticide applied to the skin of an 
animal (e.g., beef cow) will control internal parasites and pests when it moves throughout the 
animal’s body. 
8.3 Grouping based on mode of action 
a)         
Physical poison: Toxicant which brings about kill of one insect by exerting a physical 
effect (eg.) Activated clay.  
b)  Protoplasmic poison or Protein Suppressor: Toxicant responsible for precipitation of protein 
(eg.) Arsenicals. Multiple biological processes govern the accumulation of proteins critical to 
supporting a wide variety of functions within insects.  Protein suppressors act through reduction 
of specific protein levels in the pest species.  Insecticides that act in this manner are generally 
moderately slow acting. 
c)  Respiratory poison: Chemicals which inactivate respiratory enzymes (eg.) hydrogen cyanide, 
carbon monoxide 
Mitochondrial respiration produces ATP, the molecule that energizes all vital cellular processes. In 
mitochondria, an electron transport chain stores the energy released by oxidation in the form of a 
proton gradient, which drives ATP synthesis.  Several insecticides are known to interfere with 
mitochondrial respiration by the inhibition of electron transport and/or oxidative phosphorylation. 
Insecticides that act on individual targets in this system are generally fast to moderately fast acting. 
d)  Nerve poison: Chemicals inhibit impulse conduction (eg.) Malathion. Most current insecticides 
act on nerve and muscle targets. Insecticides that act on these targets are generally fast acting.  
They inhibit Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), nACh receptor modulation e.g Sodium Channel 
modulators,  
e) Growth and development targets: Insect development is controlled by the balance of two 
principal hormones: juvenile hormone and ecdysone. Insect growth regulators act by mimicking 
one of these hormones or directly perturbing cuticle formation/deposition or lipid biosynthesis. 
Insecticides that act on individual targets in this system are generally slow to moderately slow 
acting.   
• Chitin inhibition: Chemicals inhibit chitin synthesis (eg.) Diflubenzuron. 
• Growth-regulator herbicides control broadleaf weeds, and most will injure sugarbeet. 
Herbicides in this group can move in the xylem and phloem to areas of new plant growth. 
As a result, many herbicides in this group are effective on perennial and annual broadleaf 
weeds. 
8.4 Grouping by Chemical Family 
Pesticides can be grouped by chemical family. A chemical family is a group of chemicals that have 
similar chemical structures and properties such as: 
�
� Poison symptoms 
�
� Persistence (ability to stay in the environment without changing) 
�
� Mode of action 
Pesticide active ingredients can be grouped as being inorganic or organic.  
✓ Inorganic pesticides do not contain carbon. They are usually made from mineral ores such as 
copper, sulphur, or their salts (e.g., copper sulphate, sodium chlorate, ferrous sulphate).  
✓ Organic pesticides contain carbon in their chemical structure. Most organic pesticides are 
made from petroleum compounds. Organic pesticides taken from plants are called 'botanicals'. 
ofAction 
The most important organic groups are noted below. 
ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDES (OP’S) 
Most organophosphate pesticides are insecticides. This group contains some of the most toxic 
pesticides. They often have a short persistence in soil, food, and animal feed. All OP’s are 
cholinesterase inhibitors. Common organophosphate insecticides include phorate, malathion, 
diazinon, and dimethoate. 
CARBAMATE PESTICIDES 
The carbamates include insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. Most have short persistence in the 
environment. Carbamate pesticides range in their level of toxicity from slightly to very toxic. 
Carbamate insecticides are cholinesterase inhibitors. 
ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES (OC’S) 
Organochlorine pesticides are rarely used today because they have a long persistence in the 
environment. They also tend to accumulate in human and animal fatty tissues. Some 
organochlorine insecticides with shorter persistence and lower toxicity to mammals are still 
available. Endosulfan and methoxychlor are examples of organochlorine pesticides. 
Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane DDT is banned. 
Classification Common Names 
TRIAZINE PESTICIDES 
Compounds in this chemical group are all herbicides. All are mildly toxic to humans. These include 
amitrole, atrazine, hexazinone, metribuzin, and simazine. Most are systemic and enter the plant 
through its roots. A few are absorbed through leaves and then move through the plant. Triazines 
are persistent and residues may stay in the soil for a long time. 
PHENOXY PESTICIDES 
Grains and grasses are resistant to phenoxy herbicides. As a result, these are widely used for 
broadleaf weed control in grain crops and on turfgrass. The most common members of this group 
are 2,4-D, MCPA, and mecoprop. They have low to moderate human and animal toxicity. 
9 PESTICIDE COMPATIBILITY 
Compatible pesticides can be mixed together to control a wider range of pests in a single 
application. Some product labels may state that the pesticide is “compatible” with another 
pesticide. This is not the same as stating that these products can be used in a “tank mix”. These 
statements only indicate physical compatibility. 
The mixture of two non-compatible pesticides can result in: 
�
� Chemical reaction 
�
� Reduced pest control 
�
� Crop damage 
�
� The forming of precipitate (e.g., gluey globs) 
Pesticides should never be mixed unless they are listed as compatible on the label.

 6. There are two situations in which numbers 
have an unlimited number of significant 
figures. The first involves counting. A 
number that is counted is exact.
 This measurement is a counted value, so 
it has an unlimited number of significant

 Rounding
 • To round a number, you must first decide 
how many significant figures the answer 
should have.
 • This decision depends on the given 
measurements and on the mathematical 
process used to arrive at the answer.
 • Once you know the number of significant 
figures your answer should have, round to 
that many digits, counting from the left.

 Rounding
 • If the digit immediately to the right of the 
last significant digit is less than 5, it is 
simply dropped and the value of the last 
significant digit stays the same.
 • If the digit in question is 5 or greater, the 
value of the digit in the last significant 
place is increased by 1.

 Key Concepts
 54
 In scientific notation, the coefficient is 
always a number greater than or equal to 
one and less than ten. The exponent is an 
integer.
 To evaluate accuracy, the measured value 
must be compared to the correct value. To 
evaluate the precision of a measurement, 
you must compare the values of two or 
more repeated measurements.
 Copyright © Pearson Education, Inc., or its affiliates. All Rights Reserved.
3.1 Using and Expressing Measurements >
 Key Concepts
 55
 Measurements must always be reported to 
the correct number of significant figures 
because calculated answers often depend 
on the number of significant figures in the 
values used in the calculation.

 Sampling Techniques
Objectives of this session: 
Students able to 
 (1) Understand meaning of sampling 
process and its importance
  (2) Know the definations of different terms 
used in the sampling process
  (3) Learn how to apply different random 
sampling & non random sampling 
techniques 
Sampling in Epidemiology
  Why Sample?
 Unable to study all members of a population
 Reduce bias
 Save time and money
 Measurements may be better in sample than 
in entire population
 Feasibility 
Sampling
 Sampling is the process or 
technique of selecting a 
sample of appropriate 
characteristics and adequate 
size.
Representativeness (validity)
 A sample should accurately reflect distribution of
 relevant variable in population
  Person e.g. age, sex
  Place  e.g. urban vs. rural
  Time e.g. seasonality
 Representativeness essential to generalise
 Ensure representativeness before starting, 
Confirm once completed
Sampling and representativeness
 Sampling
 Population
 Sample
 Target Population
 Target Population  Sampling Population  Sample
Definitions
  Population – group of things (people) 
having one or more common 
characteristics
  Sample – representative subgroup of the 
larger population
 Used to estimate something about a 
population (generalize)
 Must be similar to population on characteristic 
being investigated
Population:
 a set which includes all 
measurements of interest 
to the researcher
 (The collection of all 
responses, measurements, or 
counts that are of interest)
 Sample:
 A subset of the population
Def. – Cont.
 Sampling Frame
 • This is the complete list of sampling units in the 
target population to be subjected to the sampling 
procedure.
 • Completeness and accuracy of this list is essential 
for the success of the study.
 Sampling Units
 These are the individual units / entities that make up 
the frame just as elements are entities that make up 
the population.
Def. – Cont.
 Sampling Error
 This arises out of random sampling and is 
the discrepancies between sample values 
and the population value.
 Sampling Variation
  Due to infinite variations among individuals 
and their surrounding conditions.
  Produce differences among samples from 
the population and is due to chance.
 Example: In a clinical trail of 200 patients 
we find that the efficacy of a particular 
drug is 75%
 If we repeat the study using the same 
drug in another group of similar 200 
patients we will not get the same efficacy 
of 75%. It could be 78% or 71%.
 “Different results from different trails 
though all of them conducted under the 
same conditions”
How to sample ?
 In general, 2 requirements 
1. Sampling frame
 must be available, otherwise 
develop a sampling frame.
 2. Choose an appropriate sampling method
 draw a sample from the sampling frame.

How to select a simple random 
sample
 1. Define the population
 2. Determine the desired sample size
 3. List all members of the population or the 
potential subjects
  For example:
  4th grade boys who have demonstrated 
problem behaviors
  Lets select 10 boys from the list

 5.
 6.
 Determine sample size 
Obtain a list of all patients with sickle cell anemia in 
a hospital or clinic
 Patient is the sampling unit
 Use a table of random numbers to select units from 
the sampling frame
 Measure hemoglobin in all patients
 Estimate the levels (normal & abnormal) of 
hemoglobin
Systematic random Sampling
  Technique 
 Use “system” to select sample (e.g., every 5th item in 
alphabetized list, every 10th name in phone book)
  Advantage 
 Quick, efficient, saves time and energy
  Disadvantage 
 Not entirely bias free; each item does not have equal chance to 
be selected
  System for selecting subjects may introduce systematic error
  Cannot generalize beyond population actually sampled
Example
  If a systematic sample of 500 students were to be 
carried out in a university with an enrolled population of 
10,000, the sampling interval would be:
  I = N/n = 10,000/500 =20
  All students would be assigned sequential numbers. The 
starting point would be chosen by selecting a random 
number between 1 and 20. If this number was 9, then 
the 9th student on the list of students would be selected 
along with every following 20th student. The sample of 
students would be those corresponding to student 
numbers 9, 29, 49, 69, ........ 9929, 9949, 9969 and 
9989.
Systematic sampling
Stratified Random Sampling
  Technique
 Divide population into various strata
 Randomly sample within each strata
 Sample from each strata should be proportional
  Advantage 
Better in achieving representativeness on control 
variable
  Disadvantage 
Difficult to pick appropriate strata
 Difficult to Identify every member in population
Mild Moderate Severe
 Stratified Random selection for drug trail in hypertension
Sampling in Epidemiology
  Stratified random sample
  Assess dietary intake in adolescents

 Define three age groups: 11-13, 14-16, 17-19
 Stratify age groups by sex
 Obtain list of children in this age range from 
schools
 Randomly select children from each of the 6 
strata until sample size is obtained
 Measure dietary intake
Cluster (Area) random sampling
  Randomly
 select groups (cluster) – all members 
of groups are subjects
  Appropriate when
 you can’t obtain a list of the members of the 
population  
have little knowledge of population characteristics
 Population is scattered over large geographic 
area
Cluster sampling
 Section 4
 Section 5
 Section 3
 Section 2 Section 1
Cluster (Area) Sampling
  Advantage 
More practical, less costly
  Conclusions should be stated in terms of 
cluster (sample unit – school)
  Sample size is number of clusters
Multistage random sampling
  Stage 1 
randomly sample clusters (schools)
  Stage 2 
randomly sample individuals from the schools 
selected
Sampling Methods
 Probability Sampling
  Simple random sampling
  Stratified random 
sampling
  Systematic random 
sampling
  Cluster (area) random 
sampling
  Multistage random 
sampling
 Non-Probability Sampling
  Deliberate (quota) 
sampling
  Convenience sampling
  Purposive sampling
  Snowball sampling
  Consecutive sampling
Deliberate (Quota) Sampling
  Similar to stratified random sampling
  Technique
 Quotas set using some characteristic of the 
population thought to be relevant 
Subjects selected non-randomly to meet quotas (usu. 
convenience sampling)
  Disadvantage
 selection bias
 Cannot set quotas for all characteristics important to 
study
Convenience Sampling
  “Take them where you find them” 
nonrandom 
 Intact classes, volunteers, survey 
respondents (low return), a typical group, 
a typical person
  Disadvantage: Selection bias
Purposive Sampling
  Purposive sampling (criterion-based sampling)
 Establish criteria necessary for being included in 
study and find sample to meet criteria
  Solution: Screening
 Use random
 sampling to obtain a representative 
sample of larger population and then those subjects 
that are not members of the desired population are 
screened or filtered out
 EX: want to study smokers but can’t identify all 
smokers
Snowball Sampling
 In snowball sampling, an initial group of respondents is 
selected.  
After being interviewed, these respondents are asked 
to identify others who belong to the target population 
of interest.  
Subsequent respondents are selected based on the 
referrals.
Consecutive sampling
 Outcome of 1000 consecutive patients 
presenting to the emergency room with 
chest pain
 Natural history of all 125 patients with 
HIV-associated TB during 5 year period
 Explicit efforts must be made to 
identify and recruit ALL persons with 
the condition of interest
